Review,Rating
I've been using your services from quite long but didn't knew your services lack so much. Your customer service people doesn't have a basic ethics of chat service where they ask for a permission before transferring. The very basic thing to know the issue is to raise a ticket number which isn't there in your chat system. Also the agent keeps of transferring internally doing nothing but waste customer's time and when we ask for a manager they can't even do that. The space is too to explain issue.,1
"Previously it was a good application, but after lockdown , they are not at all good for service, today I have placed order in dominoz pitza with Zomato, they have accepted the order, it's more than 1:30 mins gone , order not deliver, money got deducted also Zomato do not have any track that today the restaurant is open or not.... When I ask to cancel the order, then Zomato ask me to contact with Domino's",1
It's an amazing app and I've not had any issues which weren't quickly resolved. It only loses a star for me because Gold was replaced by Pro and it's not that great anymore. I also miss the levels which were present earlier which were based on the reviews written for various places. I do love the updates where ordering has become so much more easier based on the cuisine or food type.,4
This is such a bad app !! It'll have problem and then if we delete our account and login again with same number then also we're not getting offers So disgusting !! They don't even have Customer care number to contact if we have problem in app They'll give offers in phonepe but it's of no use What we'll do if coupons are of no use and we should believe their offers & coupons which doesn't work,1
"There's nothing safe in Zomato. I found small stones in my food literally. When I took pics of it and showed it to them, they don't seem to be agreeing. I am sure that the order was torn somehow and the dust entered with the small stones, yet Zomato neither refunded nor a new order reached. Totally unexpected this from Zomato. Such a shame on Zomato! :-(",1
"""Expected Time"" and actual delivery time are two completely different things. Not great when you're fasting all day and the food is 30 minutes late. Customer service is useless. It is not only the restaurant's fault, but Zomato's as well, for not having consequences for restaurants that don't deliver as promised.",1
"could improve on certain areas, once user keyed in, his 'address and 'location' that should be default, not your location specific landmarks! clients might order from all over India for their 'parents' or 'non-technical savvy' people who are located elsewhere! that's a real hiccup and irritant!",4
"Doesn't have proper location guide and view, address could not be edited had to re-enter again, offers are not good complaired to other service provider and many times offers are not available at all wherein others give much better offers. App gives fake information about temperature checking and hand sanitizing, I'm an eyewitness. Delivery charges are more than others. Zomato thinks that we should be generous to their partners wherein they themselves are stingy that too after looting us.",2
"I like the pro version, overall no complaints from ordering and finding restaurant perspective. Some restaurants food are not Upto standard. Few things that can be improved: 1. Adding instructions on text, instead of using the voice note. 2. Other day I placed an order at pizza hut the order was accepted, I called the restaurant and they reported no order was issued. Later, I called Zomato and they instantly refunded me along with 500INR coupon.",4
"App is forcing the customer to order food for more amount in case of high demand. It's doesn't allow the customer to proceed with payment for amount less than 300 when there is a high demand for orders. Customer's problems aren't solved here. They concentrate only on business and we did not expect this from Zomato. Well I could order food for less price from swiggy than what I actually added in Zomato cart, and well yeah, that's how you lost a customer.",1
The GPS does not provide proper location and approach road to the rider. This issue is not seen with riders of other delivery agencies. Of late orders deliveries are delayed than the expected deliveey time shown at the time of ordering. More control on hotels needed.,2
"Their live chat feature is helpful, but you need really good internet for the app to work properly, otherwise the payment screen will keep showing an error and you won't be able to place your order.",5
"I have been facing card payments issue since 4 years.(Credit/ debit card payment option was disabled while choosing payment option on checkout time). It seems to be specific user issue. Many times shared error screenshots to concerned team. But no response from them. By this time don't give reply to this like 'sorry for the inconvenience , please send error screenshots to Zomato help desk'. If the solution is present, then fix the issue otherwise ignore this review.",1
"App may serve the purpose of food delivery nicely but when it comes to treating them as gifts it puts our intention and effort in vain. You write a note, prepare a card and it doesn't reach or request delivery to the addressed person specifically and it never happens. It is requested if you can't handle the gift services to the desired standard please remove the option.",2
Worst experience in terms of app. I have received the 31AED as voucher for my order and it was mentioned to use within 30 days. But I thought i can use for partial order as I didn't get any instructions in message which I received. So I ordered one item which is equal to 6 AED so remaining 25 AED should be there in my wallet. Unfortunately wallet value is 0.00 hence I checked with customer care but he given the comments as you can use only one time and you didn't plan properly to use the coupon,1
"There's an issue with the application since a long time. Whenever I'm trying to place the order and pay through 'Sodexo', after redirecting from the payment gateway the amount get's deducted from my card but the order doesn't get placed. Then I have to wait for the payment to be transferred back into my account. This is a consistent bug in the application.",1
"Initially I never had to face any problems while ordering food but now whenever I try to move forward from the cart it says "" something wrong! Please check if its already ordered."" I am facing this perticular problem is happening since almost a year now and reinstalling the app does not come to rescue in any way.",1
It's is good food delivery app if ordered means they'll arrive within 25 to 30 minutes but one thing is they need to update their location option because the location is not proper it is showing wrongly.so always I'll talk to the delivery boy he don't my home.zomato needs change this one thing alone.location is very wrost in zomato,4
"Viewing the items which I am trying to order from the cart list is not possible, even after clicking on the item name, item photo, from cart list its not opening the item details. If this feature would be added, then it will be awesome.",4
WORST FOOD DELIVERY APP EVER. I WONDER THAT HOW IS IT SO FAMOUS. WHEN YOUR ORDER HAS MISSING ITEMS THEY DONT EVEN REFUND BACK. Most of the times it makes mistake in orders and most of the time the delivery boys are careless and the food is not packed properly. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THE WORST OF THIS APP COMPARED TO ALL THE APPS IN THE WORLD. AND NOT JUST ONCE OR TWICE. THEY HAVE MADE MANY MISTAKES WITH MY ORDERS MUKTIPLE TIMES,1
"I love this app. I get reliable reviews, can search by cuisine and geography, and get a good percentage discount on certain restaurants, all at one place. I enjoyed the 1+1 discounts a lot more, but I understand that its removed because people aren't making money. I still enjoy the app",5
Poor or no customer support for wrong or incomplete orders Actually customer support should be top priority but there is no customer care no and the customer support chat is inactive so there is No way to complain about wrong or incomplete orders. The delivery Valet also does not take responsibility and says we delivered what the restaurant gave and it is the responsibility of the restaurant to hand over proper order leaving us with the feeling of being cheated by Zomato and restaurant,1
"I wouldn't even give a single star, to this worst app.Till now I was using it everyday for orders , and now it's just not taking any saying it's a pro delivery restaurant. So for that you must take a pro membership. when I ought not to take one , ithas increased its fare for like every single order. That's really low. Feat really low. We are facing problems going out in night curfews and the orders are pouring in , still you care about your pro membership .....",1
Charges are extra as compared to price on the menu of the restaurant. This is fooling customers. I do not understand why people are not directly calling the restaurant for food delivery. The restaurant doesnot charge extra for container charges.. No extra tax or delivery charges People need to call the restaurant directly for delivery..,1
"I've placed an order on Zomato where I made the payment using my debit card. I picked up that restaurant specifically because it showed, that I'll receive my order with in 36 mins. After one hour i'd to cancel my order and till now my money is not refunded. Zomato seems to be a fraud online app and I'm not going to use it in the future from now on.",1
"Horrible customer service. Restaurant sent the wrong dish and zomato didn't bother about it when informed. The convenience of ordering from the app is not worth it when you don't get what you order. Would be much better to simply check restaurants, their menus on Zomato and then call the restaurant directly to place an order, since most of them deliver anyway. At least somebody will take responsibility of orders gone wrong.",1
I don't know why they kept the order support team when they aren't able to ans the cx quiery. First of all they haven't deliver me the food good and moreover while I've chatted with 4 agents they just transferred my chat to some other agents and wasted my time and my money they are just robbering the cx amount in form of home deliver they won't even responded to the cx query nd moreover the support agents order us to help them rather they have help us. He asked me to write a feedback instead.,1
"The new UI sucks. It was better before this update. Simpler. They have cluttered it with unnecessary drawer motions and map change. A note to the developers : ""when you have built the brand and people are used to the old interface, don't keep changing it again and again. People associate certain comforts with it. The moment you change it it's wierd for a while."" Change is good but not everywhere.",2
Zero stars for the new customer rating feature introduced. It reminds me of the dystopian future in one of the Black Mirror episodes where people rate each other based on mere seconds of interactions. This is not a ride hailing service where the delivery person and the customer interact for long. Introducing such a system in food delivery is a predicament mandated upon us by a senile set of individuals. Disapprove of every bit of this idea.,1
"The gifting option with certain wish in the app is useless. I have ordered food, such as birthday cakes, anniversary cakes etc, as gift, so many times with wishes, by providing contact in the mentioned criteria. No message or wishes reach that perticular contact. Useless option. Either Remove the option or try to reach the msg to the perticular contact.",3
"Time and energy wasting, while the concept is supposed to make things smoother. The hidden taxes that are added up on the app last minute but not on the menu (and not in the restaurants when we dine in, while Zomato claims it is at the discretion of the restaurant) makes it a violation of the UAE law.",1
"If it was just once or twice, I would just let it slide but for the past few times that I've ordered, customer service has been pathetic. Even their Zomato chat is just a blank screen, so how are we supposed to even contact in case of a wrong delivery? Will uninstall Zomato for the time being since it really has disappointed me. It's a shame because Zomato used to be my favourite app to order food and find new restaurants around.",1
"Amazing app, with fast delivery services. I also absolutely love the fact that they compensate for any lapse in the quality of food/service. Would definitely recommend.",5
"There is no option for cancellation. when we chat with expert for cancellation the order,the expert take too much time,and delivery comes to home and we have no option except accepting the order. This happened to me but there was no fault of the delivery boy in this. If I do not take delivery then he would have problem, so I have to accept delivery. I will never order from ZOMATO after this.",1
Delivery service is horrible very ...horrible . I don't really understand why do you accept orders from locations where you don't deliver .After the order is confirmed and it's on it's way to be delivered the deliveryman calls and says that they don't deliver in these areas and wants me to collect the order from a place prescribed by him ....I WAS SOOOO ANGRY THAT I TOLD HIM TO COME TO MY HOUSE FOR DELIVERY.But he just went back without delivering ..it was very DISAPPOINTING,1
I typically have no issue with the app in general but I've had several bad experiences with poor customer service with their support chat. On numerous occasions when I try to have them resolve an issue they claim that they can't get ahold of the restaurant. Today I called the restaurant in question directly and they answered right away and were happy to resolve it. I 100% believe the customer support just couldn't be bothered to handle the issue.,2
"My review for Zomato has changed, on times it is going good and it's better than any other food app especially compared to doggy fresh menu, as I am a regular user of these two apps. Zomato is started valuing it's customers. I really appreciate each and every staff of this company serving for your customer. Great app and great support.",5
When I want something to eat I would expect it to arrive and if there's something wrong with the delivery (i.e) if the food is not available I would want to buy something for the same money because. Hungry so when the customer service says that there is only refund it's frustrating as I'm hungry. What will I do when I don't have money to make another order. I hate this so much about Zomato even through the app is good. Please do some changes in the customer service.,1
"My experience with Zomato has been consistently pathetic and their go-to solution for all issues being coupons for future orders is equally disappointing. No matter whatever the city, Zomato doesn't fail to let one down with wrong order or many hours delayed deliveries. If you guys are not committed to serving your customers right, please don't bother running the service and wasting people's time. Very very disappointing service. I know this is supposed to be app review but it's just so bad.",1
"Where to start 500 letters is not enough to describe such long history of bad experience, but I can conclude it with 3 main points: 1. Consistent delays from drivers. 2. There is no refund, If you will get your order canceled refund will never hit your bank account 3. No customer service at all, 1 instance I got delays from driver of 22 mins, the guy on customer service was telling me is only 22 mins of delay, but he is right 22 mins is genesis record for zomato, cz delays can be up to 1 hour",1
"K so the service is terrible. I've been using Zomato for more than a year now. The tracking option doesn't work. The delivery boys have messed up with the location most of the time. The timer you guys show that how much time is left until order arrives is also broken. It shows order will arrive within 30-40 mins but arrives after more than 70 mins. The service is just getting worse. Even after telling the location thousand times on phone, they either get lost or go to the wrong house. Plz fix it",1
"App is well. Delivery is also fast. But the reason to give only 2 stars is, delivery charges are high and there is high difference between the hotel rates and zomato rates. Zomato is charging higher rates than hotel. I observed this because I've been to some of the hotels and tried to order later on Zomato.",2
"Avoid it. If your food is not edible after complaint they tell they will respond in 24 hours, after 24 hours they send a mail saying they are sorry & tell that they will try to correct it next time. Total looters. Uninstalling. It's not good for health as well. They don't take responsibility of the food being delivered they just need money.",1
"my address and location was se t to Basavanagudi, Bangalore. I searched for the restaurant ""by 2 coffee"". there is one near by place. but the order got placed with the one in Vijayanagar, about 10 kms from my place. I think your app did not pickup my location to show the restaurant near me. Also, after entering the feedback in the app, I don't see a submit button. please fix your app.",2
"Zomato is already charging delivery charge upon that it charges additional surge charges, and at times with some more additional taxes and charges. Any how prices of the food on the app are way higher compared to the price at that particular restaurant listed here, upon that additional charges and taxes are charged. For an order that's only ₹.140/- worth they charge ₹.40/- as deliver and additional ₹.45/- more as surge charge, seriously disappointing, ripping the customers pocket.",1
"Very nice app helps you order food from any place almost instantly but my problem with the app was it does not allow you to make 2 orders which are both COD,you will have to pay for the second order online. Otherwise everything with this app is fine",4
"Horrible service. The moment you will face an issue with he delivery, there will be no help from their side. I had a problem with the delivery from one restaurant twice, the driver was not assigned even after chatting with zomato representative. I waited for more than an hour and had to cancel the order both times. The customer support is useless, they will be sending you their standard drafted responses and will not even try to help.",1
"Good app to order food. Though it would help if all the dishes had photos of it, so we know what it looks like. Some restaurants do keep it but some dont. Also, if we could make some suggestions for the dishes we order would also be of great help, e.g. if a dish contains mushrooms and we dont want it we can just add that suggestion..etc.",5
"Soo many options to choose from. The Interface is extremely user friendly with easy search and navigation. Offers aren't as good as with swiggy, but once you get gold, your savings literally goes through the roof like literally today I ordered for about 1320₹ and only needed to pay about 850₹.... My only qualm is that there is no way for you to get info about the portion of curry or food and you sometime feel as if you don't get the portion corresponding to the amount you paid. (Happened once)",4
Distinguished app and it's service . They show different thing and delivery exactly different. And after that they do not accept their mistake. And also shopkeeper are rude and with that delivery boy is very rude and they charge extra for no reason. Its better not to go for it. And they don't have customer care no. Through which we can reach to them .it's really disappointed for us.,1
"3 consecutive day order is been delivered in 1 hour and 1 or half hour, where else the estimate shows while ordering is way more less. Funny part is when we tend to connect to the contact centre, there's an automated chat bot where in we cannot log a complain, just providing the offer code does not resolve the issue.",1
Dear zomato.. Your delivery time is bad.. It gets worse when you try to change the times on the fly.. 12.05+54min delivery time is12.59 not 1:09... Just because you cant provide delivery person for half an hour doesnt mean you can change timings mentioned...everytime i think about trying your service you find new ways to piss me off.. Last time.. It was.. Different delivery charges for the same order for two people sitting in the same room.. And now this..,1
"worst service. doesn't take correct gps neither they consider the extra info given by any customer in optional. The delivery boy reaches to any other destination and ask for extra money to reach to your correct address(to which I don't blame delivery boy). Just one last thing, poor service and app quality.",1
Only means to dilute profit and sell. They do not have enough time to listen to the standard and compliments of the customer who is ordering.Neither do they have any customer care facility so that people can call and talk and tell about their problems. They have only chat option which working on automated and feed replies.,1
"Food is good no doubt. BUT I usually order 2 Thai crunch salads and always put a note or cooking instructions ""plz make one of the salad vegetarian, replace chicken with avocado and keep other as it is."" but for some reason they can't get it right or they don't understand, once in every 2 orders they send it wrong, either both vegetarian or both non vegetarian.",4
"I am very much disappointed with zomato chat experience. When order get delayed or if any issue with restaurant regarding order, zomato help desk is useless. We have to depend on chat only. No call response received from zomato. Very poor service. After fighting so many times, in last order they gave me half of my total bill amount as coupons. They making fool. High charges as compared to swiggy. Finally shifted from zomato to swiggy.",1
"They are just there to show the menu of the hotel , they won't help you if your order is wrong or the quantity is less , they will just say you sorry for the inconvenience that's it ! It's better to order from the restaurant atleast they won't charge such high rate as delivery charges and if some problem occurred they will surely resolve it , instead of saying sorry for the inconvenience ! Great application for seeing the menu for sure 👍 but for ordering you have to think again 😉",1
"Zomato App keeps crashing after adding an item to the cart. This started a month back after some update and I am not able to order anything from Zomato. Check my last order. Already reinstalled multiple times, cleared data and even tried for downloading old versions through APK but couldn't install. Send reports were done but no response.",1
App is good. Working fine. Delivering food from very far restaurants also which is not there in Swiggy. It will be good if domino's also available. This is my first use and I didn't find domino's which is famous/popular in pizza and is less far than many other restaurants that Zomato tied up. All near by popular restaurants should be available. It's my opinion.,4
"You wont ever get refund in cash. And many a times the food is not packed well. Its totally useless if you think you would get any reliable refund. Their clock stops in between so that they don't have to pay you back for your late delivery. I have valid screenshot to prove it. My phone time is 9:45 and it shows 7mins away, then at 9:55pm also it shows 7mins away. This is their trick to fool customers to wait and not get the refund for late delivery.",1
I didn't had option to select no stars hence I selected 1 star. Absolutely poor customer care and hardly any response on time. Customer care executives are really careless and they just sent some useless and senseless replies even if you are showing them the proof.,1
"Food not delivered on time. It is not the fault of the delivery boy. It's the fault of the zomato app he was using. He was standing infront of me, but my name was not showing up in his app. I had to wait for 35 mins. Not expected from Zomato. Very Poor app service. 😡😡😡. But the delivery boy was very POLITE and HUMBLE. 5 star to the Delivery Boy SONU MANDAL. Good job Bro. Wish you a good luck.......",1
"I have been using zomato for a lot many years now. I used to have a lovely experience with zomato until quite recently. I have been observing an animosity from the delivery personnel towards me. Despite putting the exact address as the delivery location, the delivery guys get off at the wrong place and ask me to come to their location even if it several hundreds of meters away. When my male counterpart explained the location, he was quite cooperative. This is very sad.",1
Feeling very bad about not getting my problem resolved. Since last two days i am complaining about my problems and still not getting any solution. And i am surprised that query is very simple and visible.,1
The app is certainly not good at service. 1) They never have valets near the place I want to order from when their competitors definitely do. 2) If they do have it. They force you to add food when clearly there is no need for it. 3) They would never show reviews that they should. The one star reviews seem to gwt thrown away in a corner 4) its just way too easy to manipulate reviews on the app. For example. With amount of one star reviews my local mcdonalds the rating should have falln bt didnt,2
"Zomato delivery and customer service? Extremely bad. I would've given 0 stars if it was an option. Every time i have some issue with zomato(and it happens quite a lot due to their delivery service as they never follow the instructions even if you call them and explain it to them every time) i chat with their customer service which firstly, takes an hour to reply to every message i send, but after chatting to them for about 3-4 hours, they don't come up with any solution at all.",1
The rate of items I menu is high then what it is actually if you go the restaurant you know the rates. They increase the rates of items so the discount which is given is not real bcoz they already covered the discount by increasing the rates.,3
Not customer orientated food delivery app. Customer issue doesn't matter to zomato. No facility to talk to customer service agent. They are handling customer issue through chat and it looks like they are just passing issue through chat from ond to another. Not recommended. It will good till you get your service believe me once you have problem then you will realize to my word.,1
Excellent and quick resolution. The only food delivering app who cares for their customer's. On time delivery quick transaction and quick refund if any transaction is failed not like other delivery apps and also wrong item quality doesn't meet up. Very quick resolution with it. Boom very good. For now the app is the best out there. Finger's crossed,5
"Well , I am usually very specific and picky in rating and am highly surprised how quick and customer friendly zomato has been to me . I usually never ask for refunds because there is mostly never an issue with the food , but when I actually faced a highly disappointing situation from a restaurant they immediately refunded me the money . I am very positive and I hope people don't ever take an advantage of zomato's honest work. I am intrigued so thank you zomato . This review is from The Heart .",5
"A very big issue contacting the help of zomato. First of all these guys just dont have phone number to contact them. And the only option they give is a chat. Thats still okay, but my problem never got solved. The operator just sends the same pretyped messages to us and never solves the problem. At least you guys should have a phone number so we can talk to you guys this maintains a transperancy between the customer and you people.",1
"I have being using Zomato for more than two years. I have always wondered that in zomato serving restaurants, they have a seperate column for veg. I have a request for Zomato to keep a seperate column for chicken, then chicken lover's will be very happy about it. I hope this happens. I am happy using Zomato zing zing...",5
"Not even 1 Star. Disappointed too much. Don't waste your time with these people try any other apps. I ordered fome some food they showed will be delivered within 20 min , after 25 min when I saw they were saying no delivery person avilable(don't they know this before accepting order) and after around 45 min they showed me message if no delivery person gets in 5 min your order will be cancelled and refunded. Now my question is is that refund is enough, not any value for my 45 min. Disappointed",1
"The delivery experience is really bad from Zomato...order placed and it was supposed to get delivered in 35 mins...after one hour of wait Zomato sends a main ,that the order is cancelled due to the customer's not available for calls ..and literally the delivery executive didn't even come to the location ... Zomato customer support doesn't have the proper response at all ...I neither received the food delivery not the money refund ....worst and disappointing from Zomato",2
"There are no offers on the cards, no promotional coupons. These factors alone are discouraging to not order from this platform. At the time when going for an IPO, strong customer base and increased promotional activity is warranted. But i don't see any of these happening to me at least. As a customer all you want is that company is remembering you through promotional incentives, otherwise what incentive I've got for me to order food from this app?",2
Very bad these days. Being a pro customer I didn't expect this. Support exectives are just for name sake. Food delivery takes more time than expected and mostly because of valets coming not coming to pin location. There are instances where I had to collect the food more than a km away from marked location. And exectives just call to know if food delivered or not. Actually I feel like Zomato calls are just spam,1
One issue is that cash payment option is not available. This implies that one has to stay hungry if technical glitches happen(otp delay specifically). Kindly keep the cash payment option available for all restaurants. Another issue is their chat support section where the executive doesn't pay heed to a query and transfers the chat to a Bot stating 'I am transferring it to another agent who specialises in such queries' Is this professionalism? This impropriety shadows all other wonderful features,1
"Worst experience every time,when ever I try to order food on zomato app I'm excited and I'm waiting for the order but fortunately or unfortunately I every time experience only one thing that you deliver address is not correct or accurate.if you think it's not appropriate location firstly why do you ask restaurant to accept the order ,before the order is confirmed by the restaurant the count is deducted if your payment is by card after some time get a call saying we don't deliver to this address",1
"The app shows 50% off on a restaurant. But, when i add to cart, it doesn't show this & instead gives only 20%. Zomato charges higher amount than the restaurants do for delivery or dine in. zomato after claiming 50% discount upto 100rs., increases the tax or Packaging or delivery charges, and the final amount after discount vs before hardly has 30rs difference, which is crazy and looting customers. Zomato charges us Packing charges from the same restaurant who doesn't charge me when ordered via",1
"Initially it tent to give estonishing offers but gradually it started charging extra on price also even after availing membership which they claim is free delivery but I always been charged delivery charges....what is the use of availing membership.....for my nearby restaurant they charge high delivery charges for both pro member and regular user....No use of membership...also work on your offers it,s too high now a days...",2
"1* for app update. I uninstalled and reinstalled. As soon reinstalled app, the app is asking to update. Great development. How many times do u expect us to update app! Means am asking about frequency. This is an usability issue. Correct It. Ask monthly once or 3 month once update. Give a stable builds. Who the hell wanna update every week or just soon after installing app!",1
Hi I just created a new user on my new phone and I'm not able to apply any coupon. There's no coupon whatsoever. The coupon section is only disabled. I tried to chat with the customer service but that seems broken too. I'll change my rating but please fix this bug asap.,1
Zomato chat isn't working from pe ast many days. Worst experience ever. They are not refunding my payment. Because I had to cancel the order. They can cancel the order as per their availability even after accepting it. But we can't cancel it. There are only two options cancel the order or not. We can't make changes in order. This is very wrong,1
Very poor app. On 26th March 2021 I ordered some food. The delivery boy could not deliver my order to my residence and they have initiated a refund of my order saying that my money will be credited to my account within 5-7 working days. But unfortunately till date the amount is not yet credited to my saving account from where i have made the payment via my debit card. Today is 13th April. Moreover they cant track that refund reference no. (RRN no. ) which they have initiated from their end.,1
"I was very disappointed with my last order. I ordered food at 8:28 pm for the guest at my place and at the time of delivery ie 9:15 pm. I got a call that food can't be provided .Please answer my these questions: 1. Why I was not informed timely,within 5-10 minutes? 2.When we cancal the food,we pay the full amount as compensation ,what compensation you do?",1
"Zomato's customer service is pathetic. Usually it doesn't happen but I got a wrong order today. The people on chat were not helpful at all, just wasted my 1 hour, they were taking 5-7 mintues to respond to every sentence. After wasting 1 hour on chat (and I even shared the images of the food) they tell me to speak with the restaurant and stopped responding on the chat. Why waste time when you're not going to resolve any thing ? Just ask to speak with the restaurant at the beginning!!!",1
"My suggestion for the people using this app to order food is, just have a quick call with the restaurant you are ordering your food from before making the payment through this app and ask the total amount of your order and compare it with the zomato's total amount. When i checked my order amount from resturant it was 392 and Zomato was charging 503 for the same order after applying 10%+15% discount. Fraudsters.",1
"Very bad experience!😤😤I have placed an order in the afternoon that time the hotel was available and I got a cashback of ₹85 I was very happy and I rated the zomato app 5/5 , but then now when I was trying to place my order again which I ordered at the afternoon now at night they are showing ""due to high demand we are not accepting any orders below ₹250 "" I am very upset and that's why I have rated the app 1/5",1
Straightforward app for food ordering with discounts and minimal wait time. Delivery person was helpful as it was my first time ordering. Overall a pleasant experience.,5
"I had put the correct delivery address for my order, but your app updated wrong address to the delivery man at 0100 hours, the delivery man was nice who gave me the order on the correct address, the apps support system is really the worst so far, your support agents ask the customer to be careful of thier own address at the time of placing for another order.",1
I take back the good stuff I said. Last night I had the worst experience. Never had this kind of experience with swiggy even. Had to wait 1 and a half hour for food from a restaurant just 2 km away on top of that customer service was talking back to me and saying no it's 4 km away. What does that matter. It shouldn't take this long. Also the delivery person could not even reach the location even after I constantly spoonfed the location details via phone. Had to walk to him and get my order.,1
For the restaurants that use their own valet. Please provide an option to cancel the order if its not delivered on time. Burger King is not responding to any of the calls and the order is already delayed by 15mins (apart from the 50mins waiting time which was specified during the order),1
This is the worst app in terms of customer support ( I am doctor) but still once I received a stale food and requested to order something else from some other restaurant and nothing was heard no-one in the company has the empathy that during lockdown when people are using there app they don't have resources to cook the food thus they are ordering it from outside and during this time if something goes wrong they should atleast understand that how that person will be able to manage.,1
Service is turning from bad to worse!!! Been using this only app for a while for food delivery. But from bad they are moving to worse. Initially they used to take responsibility for and issues. Now they wisely and shamelessly put all the blame on the restaurant. Only solution for any issue is refund !!! Onus is always thrown on the restaurant. They are heading in the same direction o Food Panda. I am switching to Swiggy or Uber Eats. Really cannot trust Zomato any more. 04/04/2021 Still worse !,1
Worst experience I had so far. I made an order and it got canceled after charging my card. Now the most amazing customer service representative was not able to help me for almost 2 and half hours. Yes I was speaking to them for that amount of time to come up with a solution but nothing happened. Never expected this to happen,1
"The app is not user friendly as it frequently asks for updating.No option of lodging complaints is there. On 13/04 while ordering food in the night, double payment was debited to my account. Till now no reversal took place. Even I am handicapped to raise my complaint to Zomato. The chat option is not working. So need to be addressed.",1
Customer services is not up to the mark and useless. Food orders are used to be ready at restaurant but delivery partner is not meeting requirements and food orders are getting delivered after 1-2 hours of estimated time in tasteless and spoiled conditions. I think they need to reduce their promotional budget and need to allocate on delivery channel part. Moreover they have to go long way as campare with others like Swiggy. Nothing improved even after delivery fee of Rs. 33/- per Order.,2
Selected food from Paradise menu and I was trying to select payment options and the payment went through without my confirmation. It happened twice and very fast. I noticed only one payment and cancelled it. The other payment went through and food was delivered. Also I was about to leave for some other place when I got this food parcel. I am still in schock and not happy as it did not give me an option to confirm the payment and my credit card was charged twice without OTP confirmation. Too bad,2
Cheats changed offers from 1+1 in gold to 25%..many bought it for 1+1..feel cheated Also surprisingly rates on zomatos menu is 10-20% more than what you see on zomato .. Check for yourself. Seems hotels have to give a cut to zomato Exg chi sezwan tandoor at centre point is 260 while it's listed as 290 on zomato plus they levy exorbitant delivery charges,1
"Total waste when it comes to gift.... Please remove the option to gift an item or send e-cards to the reciever if you cannot deliver it.. and customer support team always have same reply when we complaint... ""Please give us another chance to serve you better"". This cannot be taken lightly as this is happening 4th time with me. I am not going to recommend this app to anyone as Zomato cannot keep its promise to its customers... Totally disappointed",1
"wrost service from zomato always giving reasons there is no proper customer service, I planed to give 0 star but in play store starts from single star this one also it's worth for Zomato. I placed an ordered and I'm waiting from last one hour I tried to connect with restaurant their number is switched offffff........ worst services",1
"For some reason last few days, the App refuses to bring up Non veg menu items from different restaurants. Only veg comes up. This is happening to quite a few friends in different locations in Mumbai and in pune too. Helpline says send us an email and we will resolve in 48 hrs. Lol, so we find it easier to order from Swiggy who has no such restrictions.",2
"The customer service is absolutely pathetic. I honestly don't think they have ever resolved any issue. They just lie again and again. And even when the error is on their side and they delay your order, they will not cancel your order. Update- I will not waste my energy emailing you as I know first hand that you will do nothing about it once the communication is not public.",1
Food price showing in this app is different and if we go directly to the hotel there food price is different (more than 20bucks difference is there) what is the logic behind this and in addition there are delivery charges.. And if food quality is not good whom to give complaint.. You guys are not responding properly.,1
Adds extra expense for the restaurants. There is a huge difference in the bill the consumer receives online and the bill the delivery person has.... Not at all satisfied.,1
"Incredible Zomato services and apps, they are like our exclusive suport in this pandemic, God bless Zomato and their associate restraunts, who are like our only hep in this pandemic, Where relatives turned their face, Zomato is doing incredible service. Kudos!!",5
"The price of the items are comparatively high, than other food ordering apps, but after that it give you coupon to apply. So ultimately they are not giving is discount, they are just deducting the extra amount which they have kept on each food items.",3
"The delivery charges are way unreasonable. And then there are packing charges and other taxes. Zomato gives you discount of Rs.50/60 but will charge you like Rs.120+ in the name of other taxes and all.. I understand these are necessary to keep the service going, but please acknowledge the fact that these charges are wayyyy tooo unreasonable, way too high. It has become way too useless now. The quality is not upto the mark, quantity of food is like nothing and they don't even take any action.",1
"Zomato should ensure cooking instructions are followed or an option to correct this. There no return and correction mechanism, which is resulting in waste of our money and food . If too much spicy pepper and salt us put ,we have to throw the food. Today again, cooking instruction not followed , restaurant do not pick the phone. I would give 0 rating to zomato and pro if possible as pro support is waste of money. Swing can better manage the restaurants and ensure instructions are followed",1
Very poor. Lot of missing items while ordering. And the coupon codes provide doesn't work either. No refund too. They never care about customer satisfaction. Worst service,1
"I used to love this app, but now repeatedly our orders have been cancelled without informing us. Or the app says food is in the kitchen for over an hour and when we call the restaurant, they are not even preparing it.",1
They don't have customer care to lodge a complaint. They only have chat option so that they can escape from the complaints. When u don't have that much courtesy to talk then remove chat option as well. Such a bad help option. Where they don't refund full amount when they fail to deliver the order.,1
"Zomato has suddenly become quite expensive these days. This, despite, most of the orders being delivered in recent times due to Covid. So if you're going to add exuberant amount as delivery fee and then more for taxes, and pretend like you're giving some discount on it, please give me a break! Despite having contracts with restaurants to provide you food at little cost, are you trying to milk customers' lack of options as much as possible? Using Swiggy for many orders now.",2
Too much pricey . I had compared with Hotel actual rates. Zomoto charges minimum 30 to 50% higher rates compared to original prices. They fool u giving 50 to 100 bucks as offer. And If you are in luck your food will be delivered ( during lock down) you can't rely on.,1
Initially zomato started off well providing customers with good service and better offers. Now it has turned out to be a profit making chain. There is no more offers or discounts and the prices have gone up very much comparatively. I personally have felt the need to go to a resturant is better than haveto use this.,2
"It's been 2 times out 4 orders on Zomato that my food was interchanged with other. I think this is silly mistake by Zomato delivery person. There are no marking or label on parcel, delivery person gets confused. Ultimately end up unhappy customers. Restaurants must print customer name and food details on parcel.",1
"Changing my earlier review. Having good experience with Zomato. Delivery is faster and minimum to no calling asking about delivery address. All riders are aware of location. Good Job, Team Zomato.",5
"Such a pathetic app. For the last two days, I'm not seeing any restaurants in active state at my location. I have contacted the support team, they asked me send an email with the screenshot, I did so but there is not response even after 24hours.",1
"Awful back to back experience of wrong timing display, order cancellation without justifiable reasons, acting fraud on support chat and audacity to say refund jas been iniitated when the order shows to be delivered in 5 mins (after call received from dominoes of cancelling it, as they are open only till 1am but it shows 2am.)",1
It's quite good but does one thing which is absolutely infuriating which is not automatically applying discounts at checkout. Then you accidentally order and can't change so end up over paying. :(,3
"First i used to love the app but from last few days, I m not happy with my orders. Most of the times the item is missing and when we contact customer services we only receive automated replies. Not at all satisfied with the services provided recently.",1
Everything is perfect about this app... 1.Valets are very much cooperative... 2. Very fast delivery... 3.Many choices of restaurants... 4.Much more to say but finally.....its SUPERB...,5
Worst and pathetic service over weekend. Imagine order picked up at 8:23 and not deliver until 9:30 with no idea how much more time will it take to deliver. And best part restaurant is only 1km away from my address. Amazing....... I would rate you guys negative but don't have that option.......,1
Previously I had given 5 but now changing to 1 because of absurdly high prices and scam like taxes and delivery charges added on top of orders. I have consistently found difference in prices of dishes offered on Zomato and restaurants own apps. So I have mostly switched to those restaurant specific apps as they are more competitive and generally better,1
"Very fast delivery and also a good after service and customer support. I booked 2 things from agarwal caters jaipur. And one of them is too old and smelly and it taste like feet, so i contact Zomato customer support they take action against my complaints and resolves it under 4-5 minutes. Nice work Zomato ❤️",5
"Guys if you are time specific, calculative and you hate wasting your money. Please avoid Zomato. They literally don't have a filter to the restaurants they list. And once you've paid even if you've reveived a wrong order, they'll first make you wait for 15 minutes, ask you to explain, share pictures. And then ask you to mail the same to order@zomato. Do you guys really think that's the only job we have after spending a bomb. This is the mutton biriyani i recvd BTW with no mutton. Wow. waste.",1
"It's great. Sometimes the app crashes due to lots of traffic but all in all the service is great. Response time is good and they are concerned about their customers. Hope for still better services. Edited: Quick resolution of issue, hence changing the rating.",4
By miss the order has been placed.. I requested them to cancel the order without the knowledge of refund after cancelling the order I got a message saying that it is a penalty amount so the amount will not be refunded again I requested atleast to deliver the food even that they are ignoring and you people are not ready to pay back also why you people are eating the money of customers to refund my amount.. there is no customer service also to serve the people,3
I just had worst customer service experience. Too much delay in the response time even after acknowledging their fault. I had to wait so much time just to get a reply that to say sorry for delay in response and again the same happens.,1
"Worst service I've ever seen , I just kept waiting for 2 hours for my iftar and their driver didn't pick up the food , they don't have any contact number to talk to or make a complaint and their chat support is really useless , I don't recommend it at all.",1
After half an hour of order their executive called up and told that the order can't be delivered as they are being paid for 12km. And mine location was 13km so the order will be canceled and the payment will not be refunded. If this was the reason you should not have accepted the order and should not let me wait so much when I am hungry and expecting the food to be delivered in 5 min.3rd worst experience from zomato. Should do the needful.,1
"Zomato is the best. They provide such a great customer service and discounts. I would like to give my honest feedback that mostly issues are caused by Restaurants and not by the Zomato, still they listen to us patiently and resolve the problem within minutes. I'm not a fan of any restaurant but a big fan of Zomato. No unnecessary or disruptive ads, easy quick delivery, quickly they resolve the issue effectively. Overall these 5 stars are for @zomato.",5
"Only knows to make money but doesn't give good service , food isn't delivered at times, randomly restuarant decline our orders, we wait fir food and then when we open app we realise order is cancelled, money without fail they deduct but damn refund takes a 3 to 5 days. We are actually to be blamed to be using apps to order food , better go back to being old school .",2
"Something is wrong with the latest update. After the latest update, the performance of application became tremendously slow. It is taking more than a minute to land on a home page where the list of restaurants appeared. All other apps are working fine. Something the development team should look into at the earliest.",3
"Prices are toooo high compared to restaurant rates plz check the menu card rates i saw today the black forest cake 🍰 is available for 850/- in zomato ,when i saw the same piece in restaurant menu there is 500/- the zomato is taking 350/_ ,40/-delivery , and taxes 38.49 think twice before order ,u can see the menu cord in zomato app instead of delivery change to dinning you will get menu ,check and order",1
"It's really simple to use. Help me order food i wanted. Available on every restaurants. But sometimes promo codes doesn't work,still it's good",5
All my orders are having a different mobile number which is incorrect although my correct number is registered but it is not reflected. Explained many a times through customer service / online support (since there is no option to self update) but no response so far.,1
"They charge very high as in delivering charge , taxes and restaurant dishes price too differ , that means you are paying almost double the amount. Food which is delivered also becomes cold and if order gets very late , they don't respond well , not happy with the services",1
Well this experience was the most pathetic I have ever had with any of food apps. So my 6 yr old daughter was very hungry and wished to eat from kfc. I ordered food at 19:53 to which Zomato accepted and deducted my payment too. It showed me details of the valet and expected delivery time. Tom my surprise it crossed delivery time but I did understand can be due to traffic or any other issues. At 21:00 I recieve a missed call from Zomato and there after a message that my order is cancelled.,1
Policy of zomato order cancellation needs to be checked as it seems orders get intentionally cancelled without calling customer by deliver agents. They reach near delivery area at gate and leave..Also customer service is of no use...Don't spend your efforts with them.. They can't do anything. Escalations to supervisor and they say it got cancel due to glitch in app and ask to reorder helpless . Even restaurant say this practice increasing by zomato agents..consume or sell customer orders..poor.,1
"They should notify Order Refusal and Acceptance promptly. And refund should be immediate if seller/ vendor does not provide a certain item on that day, but is mentioned on their regular menu. They should reduce surged delivery charges, because we're already charged for every delivery. Location tracking is not accurate.",3
"1. The app is good to use 2. Deleivery agents doesn't check the order before leaving the restaurant. The food is not delivered as expected (sometimes). 3. If vallet is not picking up the order because not any reason. The app should assign another vallet, how does it make sense to cancel the order. 4. Many a time the app doesn't show the exact location of a rider. 5. The customer service is just getting more pathetic",2
Poor service. The valet was not entering the street. He was just standing outside the street and making excuses that he is lost. My biggest mistake was i paid online. If i had opted for cash on delivery then they would have had to reach at the address. Very poor service,1
Worst. Just looting money in the name of Delivery surge and charges For an order of Rs. 160/- they are charging Rs.80/- extra in the name of charges. If you want to cancel the order immediately also it's not possible. They say restaurant not responding their calls whereas the restaurant people answered our calls,1
Delivery location picked during order is not showing properly when delivery agent starts for delivery causing unnecessary delay during food order as I have to explain the delivery agent my location multiple times.Zomato should atleast focus on this.If the delivery location is not getting picked properly by gps then some bug is there in the app.,1
"Today I have given an ordered But due to technical issues of app , there is shown in app ,your order is on the way few Hours, I couldn't understand what happened. At last delivery agent call   me to collect your order. Then I go to collect my order but he told me your order has been cancelled . I requested him please call customer care and deliver the food.Then he told me at first I have to give  him 5 star rating then he will deliver the food . very bad experience Zomato. .. thanks",1
"Whenever I ordered there have some problems always I have to face with food,Zero and cheap customer services, but high delivery charges, less offers, and in this Covid situation delivery charges too high and surge charges. Totally worthless app",1
I ordered the food from around and food was handover to delivery boy after 15-20 minutes. After that I was continually following up with delivery boy for more then 30 I was getting the same answer that he will be reaching in next 2 minutes. I thought he is new and unable to find the adress so I followed the map on Zomato and went to his location. He was drinking liquor while sitting on the road and all the order boxes were opened. Looks like he was having multiple orders. This is very bad.,1
"Living in Delhi NCR, this app is unavoidable. Zomato is my best friend when I don't have the mood to cook, and require some different taste apart from the regular. It's offerings are really good whenever a festival or a national event going on the vicinity. The recent checks on Valet's temperature and sanitization status is really required for these times (good job here Zomato).",5
Excellent experience i am swiggy user and i recently started ordering in Zomato. Swiggy thinks that if a user raise a compliant then they are for free food but thats not the case with everyone. Zomato verifies the issue by connecting to the restaurant thats the process. Swiggy should learn more from Zomato.,5
"Worst service I am facing every time one by one issue, this time food is not hot, I check with customer service they are saying this not our end issue you can check with resturant but food hot and all zomoto side issue only, delivery person same time delivered more than 2 order so it's taking more time to deliver food so food is not hot and quality like a local shop food but I ordered Dindigul Thalapakatti Restaurant.",1
"I don’t write reviews but this application deserves it. The only thing they do is delivery and they assigned it to dominoz. Received an order which was incomplete, and even incorrect when opened. Contacted support and they said dominoz will contact you and cancelled the chat. Worst company ethics..",1
"Order food via Zomato was really helpful. We can have food from our favourite restaurant at our home. Even during this hectic corona period. But I'm so much disappointed about the support you gave. When I got wrong order yesterday, you didn't support me and I lost my money. This was not I expected.",2
Very bad experience with the ETA. The app needs to show the exact time of delivery. We cannot be waiting all day for the order arrival. Time runs but their time of delivery doesn't change.,2
"There should have been an option to save items in your cart. If the items are not in stock at the time of actual order, the system can say so and offer alternatives. This would save time and would help us plan ahead.",3
"Customers can see only the reviews written for any store, but if the latest few ratings also displayed, it will be good for a decission. Eventhough the store gets the ratings without reviews written which were not showing for the customers. So if the customer can see atleast last 10 ratings, he can easily understand the restaurant performance.",2
"It shows place order, and after all the items are selected and proceed to payment page it shows restaurant stopped accepting orders, atleast show the time or if you are asking the customer to place order show a timer coz after adding everything and going to payment u show restaurant stopped accepting order. Thats not done, U know its gonna take 3-5 mins to place an order so show before hand that cannot place order and this has happend multiple times now",1
"Initially, the delivery time showed 35 mins, as the time goes on, the delivery time increases 10 mins for 3 times. I don't want to blame Zomato valets, as they receive 2-3 delivery orders at a time. Worst beggars than swiggy. Initially, i used to tip the delivery partner with mobikwik wallet ... , But nowadays , i couldn't use my mobikwik app to tip them with one click payment..., every time , we can't use credit card or debit card and to tip them with entering OTP or card password ...",1
"Actual restraunt prices and zomato menu prices differ by a huge margin , zomato menu is charging more than the restaurant menu also the delivery charges have gone up like anything ... Not economical anymore. Also now a days restaurants call and ask customers to send their locations on whatsapp which is literally a breach of Personal info especially dangerous for woman And I seriously condemn this. someone should file a PIL against this. Zomato did encourage this when I complained them",1
The App is good the service is good but until recently Zomato has added some clients to their list that are unable to maintain and deliver the level of food quality and service may it be packaging or food temperature or to give the correct items ordered. I have known Zomato and they can do better.,5
"Is it just me, or even others facing issues with the chat option?? Unable to access customer support / help chat option for the past 2 days. Logged out, logged in.. uninstalled and reinstalled.. nothing works. Kindly fix this at the earliest. If not for this glitch, it's 5 Stars hands down.",3
"Nice app for foodies, but have to increase the number of restaurant so that the flavours of all regions will reach the doorstep. Tracking seems to be slow or inappropriate, when it shows 500mts away, the door bell rings for delivery",4
"One of the worst app, now i understood the frustration of that lady why she assaulted that delivery person, insted of assaulting him she would have done it to the owner of this app every time i order something its either not delivered or delivery person wont pick the call and regarding to the customer service very worst service they wont give any response properly, making money by saying delivery has been cancelled from our end and taking 4 -5 to refund the money.",1
"App is good but the tax, distance fee, handling charges are more than the Swiggy. Please waive off the tax and distance fee. Reduce the handling charges by the restaurant. Accurate GPS of the customer is not available to the Zomato wallet everytime the customer needs to guide the wallets for the exact location, sometime this has made my mood off.",4
"Deliver not available from past 3 months to my locality. I used to order from Zomato earlier but from past 3-4 months the app says "" we are not currently accepting orders. We'll be back soon"". And there is no proper customer care service. I tried contacting them via email but again there is no proper response. And I have been getting notification saying your pro membership has been expired please renew. With the above said issue when there is no service provided what'll I do with pro membership",1
Payment gateway is filled with false propaganda. Even though there is not conditions on Promo code and that my payment was eligible 3 different Cards was used and couldn't complete the transaction with Promo. Once removed Promo it successfully completed. Tele support says it could be my network issue and wants me to apply next time after relogin...WTH...,1
"For every restaurant there is delivery surge or minimum order limit of Rs-200/-, which is the worst thing I have seen on a delivery app. Instead of paying delivery surge to Zomato we can simply order from Swiggy or other delivery apps where there is no word called delivery surge...",1
There is no option to put negative Star that's why I'm giving one star. Worst experience for second time. Its been 24 hrs since I have ordered my food . BUT THEY CUNNINGLY LOOTED MY MONEY. I have paid for the food and I was waiting for the delivery. That guy also talked with me. Finally he switched off his mobile and I was starving for the whole night because of curfew. You don't have proper customer service also. you didn't reply me yet.. and your promo coupon worth 200 is one third of my bill.,1
"Your delivery boys are not trained for making proper and decent and hygenic deliveries. Owing to the transport mode- BYCYCLE used for my delivery on 21.04.2021 from fillers Southern Ave, it had to happen by the time the food was delivered it had to be thrown in the garbage bin. So next time I have made up my mind to pay cash on delivery. Atleast I can check and then pay or refuse to take delivery. You all are cheating the genuine clients of some world class services which Zomato is associated.",1
"Not even 1 star, because i had very bad experience ever i order 2 shawarma from this app and the shawarma was not at all good they gave me without mayonise and chicken was totally dry i was not able to eat so i just chat with the zomato agent and informed the same and sent the picture but they are just ignoring me and not replying i just sent the 50 messages till now i didn't get any reply and also i ask them to call me even they didn't call...literally worrest customer support experience i had.",1
Good options to get food anytime but don't expect any resolution if the items are missing in your order as you already paid for it. Feels like daylight robbery from Zomato,1
Easy interface and amazing chat support. Not only booking of delivery from a host of eateries is a great option...but the Outstanding part is rapid resolution of any issue through interactive chat. Absolutely Outstanding. Keep it up. A special thanks to Mandeep who resolved my issue with poise and flair.,5
"The prices are always higher (double sometimes) than the restaurant and later putting fake offer to show reduced price. After that adding delivery, packing, tax, road tax, income tax, wealth tax, toll charges, LOL what not!",1
"I now prefer Zomato to Swiggy. Many a time when Swiggy says there is no delivery to my location, Zomato delivers! A few months down the line and Zomato is still awesome. Hope this continues. (Due to some additional glitches in the app, and lack of support, I have now gone ahead and uninstalled Swiggy from my phone.)",5
I placed the order from mojo pizza through zomato at 9.14 pm dated 20th april 2021 and i haven't received my order yet and app is showing now that that order is delivered. I have already made the payment of Rs 562.15 through SBI. The number provided by zomato to call mojo is showing invalid. There is no proper customer support.I am trying chasing both mojo amd zomato since i have placed the order. Its pathetic... I am going to file a complaint against both. You are making fool of your customers,1
Zomato used to be good. I rated it 5 star few years ago. But now it has transformed from a dreamy startup to a giant corporation which is disconnected from the hassles a customer has to feel when they order anything from their restaurant. The phone number Of restaurant is invalid. The customer executive doesn't answer your questions for 10 minutes. I mean what kind of service is this.We need better and more empathetic players in this field.,1
Delivery has been on time. I liked the feedback section where you can mention how your food against each item that you ordered. App is easy to use. Keep up the good work.,4
"Easily the best app for food delivery there is. Everything is smooth and the offers are also great. Whenever there is any problem regarding the delivery, the help center is efficient.",5
"Good application & helps the needy who cannot cook. Also approx 30-40 mins are there for delivery, which is not a big time for waiting. If you come from office & order the food, take shower & just relax, the wait is over.",5
Very worst service I got it from them today. We have ordered one but we got another one which we are hate to eat and almost we are around 1.30 hours waited for getting our order. Last few months I am noticed one thing from Zomato delivery persons they are all getting 2 more orders to delivery at same time. That is the reason our ordered food was taken delay for delivery and wrong items receiving.,1
"Without doubt more reliable and responsive than Swiggy. My orders always get mixed up on swiggy. Nobody at swiggy is bothered about addressing customer complaints either. Zomato scores top marks on that from. No matter which restaurant that I order from on Zomato, I get the correct items on time. Keep up the good work guys.",5
"Poor customer service Update' STILL POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR OVER 3 MONTHS FOR MY REFUND AND I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED IT. CUSTOMER SERVICE CHAT SUPPORT IS VERY DISAPPOINTING, SAME GOES WITH THEIR EMAIL SUPPORT. THEY KEEP TELLING ME THE SAME ANSWERS AGAIN AND AGAIN. I'M REALLY DISAPPOINTED!! IF I COULD GIVE NEGATIVE STARS I WOULD GLADLY GIVE THEM!!! POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! BEEN WAITING FOR 6 MONTHS FOR MY REFUND",1
Always late...delivery Customer service executives are always right...Customer is always wrong...and they always apologize and will improve.....haha but for me in 2 years not improved....but only deteriorating... I am highly disappointed 😞 If you want to keep waiting for your food..and pay 10 to 15 % extra appx....go ahead,1
"Zomato Service is marvelous fast Oder accept & fast delivery 🚚 & Mr purshottam very nicely boy ( My is complait is that whoever made the pizza or the shop he was in, made such a pizza as if he was giving me free, one was a raw pizza and the bread was two days stale like that pizza, we just made a bite of it. Only put the rest of the dust bean box)",5
"The worst experience because they have options of sending e-cards with food which they never delivered on time, and when we ask to customer support they use fancy words...we will take care next time. What's the point of next time when somebody's suprised is ruined just because of their negligence and irresponsible services. Third time experiencing this and with a heavy heart I must say....they fool customers in a very appreciated and appropriate way.",1
"I don't understand it been years since you launched and until now you didn't add delivery charge I must go to restaurant page add food to bag just to see the delivery fee, why not just add delivery fee next to cost per person or anywhere else it saves time Talabat did it since the beginning.",2
Have ordered something and it have not been delivered on time it was actually too late but the zomato was not ready for refund. They asked for cancellation of the order and i couldn't do anything as i have paid already and there was no cancel option . Totally disappointed .,1
"This is the best app that I use for ordering food. Can't complaint anything. App is great, service is great team is awesome. Just the one thing zomato needs to take care is hygiene of their partner restaurants. My recent experience of La Pino'z Pizza Borivali restaurant was horrible due to their worst hygiene and mosquito filled area.",5
"Very bad experience as delevery is taking so much time and delevery time automatically changes. Delevery person is not picking the call. Customer support is not even bothered and transferred the complainant to other, even after 15 minute no one replied or considered the complainant.",1
"They don't have customer care support to lodge a complaint , they have only chat option so that they can escape from complaints. When you don't have that much courtesy to talk then remove chat option as well.",1
"Very bad experience. Orderd food from Zomato but items are different what I odered and food was cold also food was spiiled. And customer chat service is horrible too , They never responds you and only talk like chatbot. I would suggest never use this app. Customer chat support never provides resolution.",1
The payment sometimes doesn't go through and then I get refunded right after like after 12. That's a bit annoying but maybe that's my bank causing the issue. Other than that... superb!!! Foreign companies could learn a thing or two from the zomato model.,4
"Not a single instance of any haggling or hassles. User-friendly app. No difficulty in placing the order. The delivery representatives I have interacted with, have all been very good, very courteous, polite, and professionals.",5
"I think 1 star also waste. I have ordered 2 items in one order,but i received only one item.when i am pressing chat it is coming back to same page. I am very disappointed.i have paid money for both items but i received only 1 item. What about item or money refund. So i lost right. Great service keep it up.",1
"Very poor service from Zomato. The order, shown to be delivered in 40 mins takes more than an hour for delivery. This when I am Pro member. Focus more on delivery time than discounts or other random stuff.",1
Zomato in raining situation can you explain why you are taking 40% extra charges... At basics you hv increased 30% which is already very high on that in raining 40% extra?... This extra where is going as per feedback your delivery boys is not getting anything extra.... My suggestion reduce the payment of upper management who are useless in zomato and pay my hard earn money to your delivery boys,2
Very very poor customer service. Not reaching food at time. Delivery boy number is nt reachable. So many issues they have.... don't order food from zomato its total waste of time.,1
In the starting it was good but now cash on delivery is not coming only as an option of payment I have seen in many other devices it is coming but not only in my. And I do not use online payment.,1
"I think 1 star also waste.I have ordered 2 items in one order, but I received only one item.When I'm pressing chat ,it is coming back to daame page. I'm very disappointed ,I have paid money for both items,but I received only one. What about item or money refund .so I lost right.Great service keep it up🙏🙏🙏",1
"I have orderd fry piece beriyani but I have not received what I have ordered and that beriyani also not good. Chicken getting bad smell and I believe that chicken was not fresh it was yesterday chicken. I have reached out zoomato agent through chat but they have not helped me after doing chat more than one hours with 3, 4 service agents. Zoomato customer care very poor and helpless",1
You've over-burdened your deliver executives... Initially I thought that the tracking is faulty as it was showing the delivery executive's location in Mahanagar... But he was actually there !! Better not take orders beyond capacity instead of exhausting the executives.. It took 2 hrs for the order to reach.. No point of cold food.. On top of that you people misguide with the expected delivery time and increase it by ten minutes every time..,1
It's services are 4.5/5.. But the Riders must not only stick to delivering and getting rid of the parcel.. But also try to build a PR with their customers.. I'm impressed that a lot of riders are well mannered and Descent.. Zomato has grown up exponentially since the 2 years ( according to my view).. But anyway ... Thank for your support and services,5
Food was mishandled twice in a row. Some items were missing. Chat doesn't have an option to talk to an actual representative so the option to explain the issue isn't there. Bad experience with Zomato pro in the recent past. Doesn't seem like it's worth renewing.,1
"Very smooth working app. Fast Delivery. There has been a Lot of improvement as compared to previous 2 or 3 years. You can go through it, will love it definitely.",5
"Your hidden pricing doesn't give nice feeling, now when you order suudenly Rs 404 becomes 535, taxes, delivery charges, tip, donation is added automatically by you. Besides you are charging apox 30% from vendors. This all amount to excessive profiteering, shows greed has seeped in Zomato's DNA, long term it is definitely not good for your company. I had rated you 5 star earlier now downgrading to 2 stars. This feedback is wakeup call, you may not realise it now. Truly veteren foodie",2
"The worst service ever. Have messed up things multiple times and on a continual basis, so cannot be a one off scenario. Despite being a pro member, i just uninstalled it. It was a pain and would strong not recommend anyone!!!",1
"I choose zomato everytime bcz it is fast and easy but when it comes to delivery it is very bad ,they never get to the location and we end up meeting them to another location,i think that whatsapp and location usage knowledge is a must ,plus it would be nice to work with lebanese people.",3
Best app to order food with the comfort of it being delivered at your doorstep...plus their customers service is cherry on the cake...would rate them 10/5 stars for such superfast and amazing delivery everytime 😄😄😄,5
Nowadays started loving this App... Support persons are really understanding and we can review the restaurant from previous customers which make us take better decisions... The app is perfect and their delivery partners are very professional.,5
My experience was good. But it will be really helpful if zomato can come up with a customer support number. The chat take quite a long time to solve any issues or any refunds.,4
"Worst ever experience Food items ordered were not delivered fully . One item was missing although they took money for entire order. When contacted customer care ,he had no answer and didn't gave the escalation matrix number after my repeatedly asking for the same. If at all you order from zomato make sure you check all the items before paying them , large scale fraud of missing items at zomato are at a rise",1
"Having scarcity of cash, accepting credit cards on orders is an excellent feature. The app is well designed, easy to use and straight to the point. Nothing to complain about.",5
"The algo it uses for delivering at 2 different locations is pathetic. Just because I am at right side of the road, it doesn't deliver to me (given that there is a cut at the divider right in front of my building) and prefers a delivery at 3-4 kms ahead first. And the delivery guy has to follow what app shows even when he knows I could be delivered first! Always gets cold food if the delivery person is assigned with 2 deliveries.",1
"Worst service ever. Why would I order food over app if I won't apply coupons to save my money and chat executive says you haven't applied code so need to pay in full. Installed again to give it a try. However, the new UI is difficult to understand. I could understand TENET faster.",1
"Zomato is doing nothing to improve its service. The customer chat window never opens, valets gets assinged after 20 minutes with no updates. I wrote similar review few months back, can't believe it has become a reccuring thing.",1
The food order from the app is expired. When I ask for replacement they are not ready to replace it. They are not even ready to refund the order. This is too unfair. Apologize doesn't get my money back. Worst customer care service.,1
Amazing experience. The service is great. The app is good. Edit: Service is not good anymore. They items are missing or wrong item delivery is common.,1
So many crashes and app keeps hanging. Currently when ever I open customer support page white screen comes and it hangs. Close app open customer support page shows 2 new message but again white screen. Worst experience trying to order food.,2
The app performance is good. I like it. But some hotels will provide food in not good condition. Pls consider and confirm the food and snacks sweet are good and new or not. The forward to the customer. If u fail in this the customer have bad experience with u not with the hotel.,4
All restaurants landed in this are selling edibles at doubled prices.. The quantity of food and the quality that u see on the picture provided is completely fake and never the same. On top of the doubled price and less quantity.. 1..they charge packaging charges worth 20 in which they only apply tapes all over your Paper package ....I can buy a copy with that much 2. Delivery charges are understandable. 3. Gst/sgst...which is not included if you go directly into the restaurant sit and order.,1
"I think this is the best app for ordering the food.Easy to use,Easy to order, Everything is perfect..But you need to improve your app layout.Please make it more attractive...This is the only thing I want from you to work on,Rest is pretty nice.Well done Zomato keep ourselves healthy.....👍👍😍👏",5
Zomato has always been my go to app when it comes to food ordering. The number of restaurants are more than other food apps and also the offers. It also has different payment methods.,5
"It's is definitely better than Swiggy or any other food delivery service. If there is issue with food, the customer service team really understands the issue and refund the price immediately if it's genuine. This Lockdown Zomato had really been the savior. Swiggy doesn't take customer complaints seriously.",5
Most of the times the order is not getting delivered by the mentioned delivery time for a particular restaurant. Most common reasons being no valet available or valet declining the order. And all this is realized by the zomato team only when u have to contact them and waste some more time. Really sad for such pathetic service provided where you spend so much money on the charges.,1
"Worst delivery and customer care service.Since I was unable to attend the call of delivery guy, without confirmation he takes photo of the food outside the door without ringing the bell.The easiest mode of contact would have been ringing the bell, or the order should have been cancelled.Now that I take the issue to the customer care, they keep me hanging without any logical solution has put me on hold forever.They clearly won't be giving any refund for the food that has not been delivered.",1
"Ridiculous application and very disgusting customer care it has . I had ordered cake and it was found distorted completely . It ruined my complete occasion and I did not get my refund till now . Not sure how the CEO of this company is running this organization with such illiterate peeps working along. For reference of this post o have dropped an email to the team , if you guys will get time kindly response back because I feel without a customer care this comply is already idle.",1
Giving two stars because the price of any restaurant in Zomato is high than the original price in the restaurant. It takes to much tume to deliver than mentioned in the application also the discounts are very less. It would be better if these things are improved,2
"UI / UX experience is not so great . The food bloggers won't find it convenient to text in upload / edit reviews or check or interact with followers and even not so easy to check your own foodie rating or how far to go to reach next level etc . Hire some better UI folks and retrospect continuously to improve the app . If you pay me , I can help improve as well 😂",2
"Over the time Zomato has become bad very bad. For almost every order, I'm being charged surge fees. Already their delivery fees is high and on top of that surge fees. If you are very rich then it might not bother you. But for most of the people it matters. If I'm ordering something of 200rs from a 3KM restaurant, then you have to pay minimum 70rs (Delivery charge+Surge). Seriously !!!!. Sometimes minimum order it shows 300rs. Sickk. Zomato is just exploiting consumers during this Covid times.",1
Best food app ...customer care service is best...but sometime food get delay but they apologize and give coupon.but I want zomato to improve its app as location does not work and food doesn't reach in expected time...I hope if this thing is kept in mind it will be best app,4
I wonder if zomato has quality/quantity check in Siliguri. The food here from most of the places is not at all good. It seems anyone just registered and started selling (bad) food. It just makes a person skeptic to order from new places because of the continuous bad experiences. And also the very same restaurants have rating higher than 4. Very very few restaurants have stayed regularly up to mark in every order. Highly disappointed.,1
Actual rating is 3.5 I don't know to how to select 0.5 rating. I have never given the best deals offers or promotions code. And the graphics of the application is obsolete not pleases the eyes. Also it hangs at lot more places in the app.,4
"The level of customer service is pathetic. Never order. Talking to their customer service when the items in your order is missing is an unbelievable traumatic experience. Afreen, Customer service advisor from Zomato has been terrible and I'm sure that they have employed many as such to provide hassle and not resolution to the customers. P.S - I wanted a refund for the items that were undelivered and I was denied a refund for my own money that I chose to order from zomato.",1
"I had few bad experience in past, but that was past, it seems that Zomato now take their service seriously and now its been some while I am regularly ordering through them, no issue till now, keep it up guys for the good job, really happy with the service..",4
PatheticToday I placed an order at7:22pm.It's supposed to be delivered by8:22pm or it will be free.Order didn't get delivered by8:22pm.I have contacted with support they said order is pckd & it will be delivered in10min.I keep on telling them please give me proper status otherwise it will be too late & I will be left with no food due 2 night curfew.If it can't be delivered please cancel it I will place another order.Till 9:30 they were misleading & I ended up cancelling the order & hungry.,1
"I like the app. I am willing to pay reasonable delivery charge but sometimes the extra charges are too high. I know a restaurant which lists it's menu higher than actual rate, and on top of higher rates we have to pay service and package charges... Not reasonable imo.",4
Very nice App you can see the delivery boy and how much time will he take and very fast dillivery i love this app and i reccomend you to install this App and the delivery is safe secure and all my orders very nice and good ....... Thank you Zomato in Emergeny or do u want to order online then use this app,5
Very bad experience from Zomato.. Mistakenly I ordered same item 2 times.. I have contacted them to delete the item from that order but they unable to do that... As a provider they must have this option atleast to help customers.,1
My customer support experience on Zomato has been very good. Also I like the option for giving voice instructions. The only issue is that the delivery man can't be rated later.,4
"Worst experience... restaurant cancelled the order on their own and app was showing that the rider is on the way and after 1 and half hour when I contacted the customer care,he was clueless for like 15 min and then told me your refund is initiated. I guess the Zomato app doesn't understand the importance of their deliverables, it's now an apparel ordered from flipKart its food, you cannot cancel the order. What should customer eat if you cancel the order in the corona induced restrictions.",2
I am really disappointed with the service.. a week ago i had ordered pizza and chicken wings from Domino's and paid for both.. but restaurant person called me up and said that chicken wings were out of stock.So only pizza was delivered and i was told that i will get refund for chicken wings.But till date i have not received any refund or any message regarding that. I even tried many times requesting through zomato chat.But all they do is to reassure. i wl never order anything till I get refund,1
"Very helpful application..... has always come in handy for special occasions, during lockdown & for emergencies..... I have had good experience with zomato almost all the time.... hope this will be maintained by their team .",5
Very bad experience....item has been delivered half n late from the given time...The delivery guy was unable to locate The address and his phone was also unreachable...very pathetic ...I just uninstalled the. App..when I ordered from Zomato the delivery came by rapido..what non sence...service,1
"Had a very bad experience for 2-3times. Your systems are outdated literally. I don't know why you guys assign a cyclist for a order distance greater than 5kms. After 30-45mins, i get to know that the order cannot be delivered. When you guys know distance is more than 5km can't you put a race condition/validation in your systems? :/",4
Its really nice to use opt out on delivery option for that we are getting the orders on time. This idea is really helpful for customers...plz keep it up...and give some more offers for that customer whonis using it regularly....,4
Zomato deserves -5 rating for their new policy to make customer and delivery boy(DB)wait for the second order pickup even though first order is ready to be picked up. DB had to wait for more than 30 mins with the my parcel to collect the second order which he has to deliver on a opposite direction. This doesn't even make sense on why he has to wait for more than 30 mins when he can deliver the first order and return to restaurant with in 30 mins as he has to deliver 2nd order on the other side,1
"Love this place for it's food the food served was fresh and delicious. The staff is very polite, service is remarkable. restaurant is situated at the heart of city. everything was just excellent keep it up.",5
Works fine...but there are few issues regarding it that I want to mention. There is no point in giving 40% off when you're gonna add more Rs.30-40 to the cart value..and then apply the discount. So eventually you end up getting only 10-20 Rs discount.,3
I had placed an order and had issue with it...I am not able to report it...tried chating but even tats not working...just a blank screen...worst experience...going worst day by day...wast of buying pro pack...work customer service...,1
Everytime When i place order it shows that you food will deliver in 30-40 minutes but most of time it take more than hour. When i complaint regarding this then said this will not happen again but this happen everytime. Worst experience with Zomato.,1
"This app is very much useful but delivery charge should be decrease by company coz every local restaurent can deliver their order to home with free, if zomato day by day increase their delivery charge then noone will not order anymore by zomato",4
"And now, why can't we use coupon codes? Could have saved 20 AED on my last purchase and was forced to order without a code because of the error. And don't ask me to contact you because your support on call doesn't help and neither does writing an email.",1
good app. delivery charges are more so giving one star less else everything is good. I understand delivery charges are based on certain parameters but they are more compared to other food partner like swiggy.,4
"Hello Deepinder Goyal,This is to inform you that, I had placed an order from your so called Zomato application one hour ago.The order has been accepted by the restaurant and the order was picked up by some xyz delivery excutive, who's details and contact number was not mentioned in the app. Soon later after waiting for almost 45 mins and also making others wait, I've surprisingly received a notification by stating that I should write my concern through email and they will review it inbetween 24-",1
"Zomato has definitely improved a lot in the past few years. The UI has gone a wonderful overhaul. However, the customer support leaves much to be desired. The responsiveness and solving issues are just some of the issues with it.",4
"Very bad customer support.I ordered a coffee from app and did online payment ,my order was cancelled and my money is not yet refunded until now and it has been more than one month.I tried calling my was not connected in customer support services also emailed them neither they bothered reverting back.Now I am even more afraid in placing an order through Zomato, never faced such problem with swiggy.Now I don't even suggest my friends to place order from Zomato. HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED.",1
"Zomato is the best food delivery service. I have not experienced any sort of issues till date and the delivery is faster, location tracking is accurate with very good delivery agents. Love Zomato!! Cheers & continue the quality of service!! I recommend everyone to use Zomato. Always experienced the best customer service. I wish I had a choice to rate them 100.",5
"Had a terrible experience while placing an order. They've blocked cod option unnecessarily. After telling them about it, they say place prepaid orders. Really disappointing.! There are far better options like swiggy.",1
"What is wrong with customer support, chat is not working from past one month. Earlier I rated 5 star but now I am editing my review because there is ko other way to complain about this. It's so annoying to order something that I would rather cook than ordering. Thank you",1
"My phone is Samsung galaxy A7 2018 running in android 10. When I open this app it asks to make location ON, surely I agreed and I Tap Yes, but again asking the same dialogs. Repeatedly asking for location On. After we tap yes again asking for location access. I never seen such a mad app.Waste of time and energy. I advice to everyone please go to any restaurant as you wish. Never try this app and don't become fool like me. I don't want any replay from Zomato for this comment. Utterly disappointed",1
Orders are often not accepted by the Zomato App... Which is not a good idea...It always do not deliver as we expect them to do. Even the delivery guys take a long time to deliver the food.,4
"Worst UX, seems not properly tested. Can't go to prev screen on new user detail screen to retype the credentials. Why force to save the card details. Should include an option to be àble to order without saving card information.",2
I placed my order but unknowingly the location was different immediately I approached the support over the chat to change my address or to cancely order but the response I got was too bad and they didn't even refunded my money. I suggest everyone better not to choose Zomato.,1
Zomoto is most useful app. service is super. Best hotels are in their list. Kids and old peoples no need to step out. They can easily getting food from hotel by ordering in zomoto.super😍🤩👍,5
Very bad experience with the recent order placed at 8 pm it showed order collected at 9 pm where as when contacted the delivery boy he said he has not collected the order till 9 35 pm strange this system is being modified by zomato or the delivery boy said to say during these difficult times people say lie. Very very bad service issue.,1
"I only use Zomato for making food orders online. I can say I have faced issues in 10 per cent of the orders owing to Zomato/Delivery person. However, I have always voiced my concerns and apart from one incident all my concerns have been met by customer care. Hence, four star.",4
"Its service is very bad, today I had an order, I had a problem, I asked for support, I did not get proof, the order was in cancellation and my money was not returned.",1
Really Disappointed by the recent deliveries. My two of the order showing order recieved on app while the restaurant says they have not got the order. The valet keeps his phone unanswered for a long. This is heights of disappointment.,1
Zomato price is very high when compared with actual menu price in the restaurant. Pro users do not get any waive off in the delivery charges!! Displaying high price and then giving discount doesn't make any sense at all!!,1
I have excellent delivery experience from Zomato they deliver to far away locations too. As compared to Swiggy Valets don't call much n reach at your exact location. Zomato just needs to convince more restaurants n outlets for service with great seasons offers n discounts. New update has decent user experience n Restaurant search.,4
Horrible experience....The offers which offer at the time of delivery is not gets applied at the time of payments...no such support from technical part...when sone problems arise in case for orders no one is there for help!!! Worst app,1
"Execellent app with a very user-friendly interface and on-time notifications! Used it several times without fail to order from restaurants and smaller places. Features such as adding voice instructions, live tracking and restaurant reviews make it a breeze to use.",5
Very nice application for me as a food blogger and food lover. I explore new dishes on it and order to taste the different types of dishes.,5
Worst service..uninstalled...food is delayed by one hour in a city where it took less than 5 minutes to cross that i might understand but the agent provided to solve the problem is taking forever to rply. Seriously worst service.,1
Best app!!! It just brings our favourite outlets so near to us that too in so less time. Just one negative thing is that most of the coupons are not of use so the number of coupons should be increased according to the user. Overall too good👏👏,5
"The order was so bitter so I started to chat with your executive and my waiting time for each message is 10mins. And they have not refunded the full amount, I have thrown the entire parcel into the waste bin. Worst service.and waste of my time and money",1
Shows 50% discount and then they cover it by charging double delivery charges and restaurant charges. Enough of making fool out of people... give some genuine discount else dont show it... wont even give 1 star if there was a choice,1
"1)Now & Privious Lockdown zomato served & reached us, still continuing.its really Good.Saluit ZOMATO. 2)As compaired to other food delivery app zomat is the best in aspects of cheap price, food variety, restaurant variety, less delivery time, associated restaurants food quality. 3)Now a days Zomato started a special billing tactics. # Delivery charge # Added Tax Day by day Tax & delivery charge is increasing. If we are Ordering- Food 200 Delivery 35 Tax 28 Total 263 This is Very bad.",5
Absolutely seamless processes. Sometimes however it gets difficult to get through certain restuarants in case of an error hence one less star. Zomato does its best to provide best service.,4
Extremely poor interface. It doesnt automatically select address if you are in different location and there is no way to change address either. Very poor interface and customer service,1
I ordered from subway but my order was cancelled because they are not open if they are not operational than why would they accepted my order if they did it mistakenly than why was it so much time to informed me. I am hungry and I was waiting for my food though I have early morning shift tomorrow because I m hungry I couldn't sleep. Do u guys really think that refund will be enough for me . What should I do rightnow. I am staying in a hostel and I don't have anything to eat .,1
In recent days service is very poor....and delivery is always late more than an hour... very bad experience since last 2-3 months...and always facing problems,1
"Poor experience. Order is accepted and later cancelled. Also I wasnt informed. When I checked my phone to see the delivery status,it was cancelled. Extremely poor service. I am uninstalling this app. Swiggy is way more better.",1
"This app is just ""okay"" types to order food from. As a customer you have to chat with the team, which is sometimes an irritating and time wasting also.",3
It's pathetic when it comes to customer service. I have been trying to reach out since morning for the wrong item delivered however no answer. It says we will reach out in less than 3 minutes but no way.,1
"It's very dissapontonting to get this kind of se vice Zomato is providing customer support remained busy when I complaint about the ordered which was placed from Chopsticks, I received Pork instead of chicken and no action taken neither any refund issued towards the same, I would say in this regards that Swiggy is best towards customers issue they refund immediately or send a fresh order instead, hence uninstalling this app also would definitely not recommended anyone to order from Zomato.",1
"Worst app, no shop accepting order from this app. They want instant money but after order declined by restraunt they refund it after 7 days. What if I will pay after 7 day for today. Worst company, worst app. Even they don't wave customer care number. Worst company I ever see",5
"Very good app. Easy to use, good experience with payment, tracking, delivery etc. Personally, I prefer swiggy in Mumbai - they have more payment options and the super program is better for me, since i don't dine out too often. I usually use zomato when I'm out of town or if the restaurant is too far.",5
"I have ordered from this app almost every time in Pune but when I come to Patna than zomato didn't manage delivery boy here. No dressing sense, no sense of talking zomato delivery boy in Patna.",2
"You order food and wait for an hour to know your food is not coming. All you get is calls from different representatives and delivery person requesting you to cancel the order for a compensation of 125 rupees free credit in your Zomato account with disclaimer to be used within a month. No, you have to wait for refund if you don't have money for next order. What you mean it's a month end and don't have extra money. Goodluck in ordering your food from this App.",1
"Zomato assigning orders to executives very far from the restaurant. Wrong estimated time for delivery. As far as I have seen, restaurants usually don't start preparing before the executive reaches. This can be handled better by giving the right estimated time or the restaurant being quicker with prepaid orders at least.",3
"Sorry to say if order some things after delivery if check every time we r missing onions, salads, just I am say that ask them to check once before they take from hotel or restaurant from any where other wise evething is fin , I am satisfied with Zomato",4
"Issues with Zomato: 1. They never come to address mentioned. 2. They never come inside the building, and Hanover the delivery in the flat. 3. Every time I have to go down and pick up my order. 4. It's really very troublesome.",1
I had just placed an order by mistake and immediately went to cancel my wrongly placed order but your pathetic policy asked for a cancellation fee of 75/- which is not justified at all. I would have agreed if I was cancelling it late and the food was already prepared or it was out for delivery.,1
"Awesome app, very easy to place orders and always have one or the other promo codes. Best part is, in case of delay in food delivery, they have given option to claim money back or they will donate a meal to feeding india org on our behalf.",5
"Just had a terrible experience number of times the moment I order , they don't take responsibility for the restaurant bad food, late delivery, tax amount changes after we apply discount codes, just a waste of money, had a terrible experience, just damn the Zomato pro, moving on to swiggy I hope they treat customers better than this",1
Previously I have given 5 star rating.. But now I have to say the worst app even.. I have been placed order 2 hours ago from a local restaurant.. Till now your vallet is at restaurant..!! My family members got disappointed and go to sleep without the dinner only for the zomato.. What will I do with the order now?? If there's a cancellation button I will surely cancel it!!!,1
"Previously it was better when I was able to explore the restaurants, their menus and photos, now on delivery options are there. Tired of this app",1
My first order ever on Zomato was placed at 7:24pm and the order was confirmed for delivery between 8-8:10pm. I receive a call ar 8:35pm from Zomato stating the order cannot be fulfilled! When restaurants are working only until 9pm during this Covid Crisis should my family go hungry due to your inefficiency??? No more Zomato!,1
"I donno who to blame for the very delayed delivery, whether the restaurant guy or the delivery man. I literally got the delivery late about an hour they mentioned. That was a real bad experience I had, I wish I had an platform to discuss my issues reg the hotel with Zomato so that they can take any action.",1
"Absolutely pathetic experience. They say it's on time or free, the app prompts it, and then while providing a coupon, they deny that rider already reached 50 m. Why does your app prompt that I can claim my coupon.. And absolute false and bogus marketing that it's on time or free, coz all they give is 200 rs regardless the cost of the order...Bogus policies and a bogus corporation",1
"Everything is perfect but still 4 star i gave. Because in today's situation of covid, yesterday what i noticed when i placed order from Zomato that the temperature shown for the delivery person was as of last checked 24 hours ago or 18 hours ago.The delivery person is delivering orders the entire day. Before every order the temperature should be checked as he is traveling meeting new people whole day. Also the temperature should be checked hourly or frequently for every individual involved.",4
"This review is for today's pizza delivery. The pizza is carried by Zomoto like bag not like pizza. The total pizza became paste, crushed to corner of pizza box. All toppings with cheese fallen out from pizza base. Very poor handling.",1
"Very pathetic experience from zomato, I had waited for 40 min for my order but yet it is not delivered, and suddenly you people call to say that there was a temporary glitch and you are cancelling the order, we are in a covid situation and you guys treat your customers like this...... Very very disappointed....",1
Zomato is a daylight robber...cheating...there is a huge difference between items cost from zomato and the restaurant..restaurant items cost is comparatively lower that what zomato is charging..I enquired with the restaurants..if the restaurant cost for a particular item is 60rs..the zomato is charging 100rs..excluding delivery charge.. hence I am uninstalling this looter..,1
"Hi , please add Amazon pay option also in payments. Because of this I had to use Swiggy (never going to use this again ever , pathetic customer service) . Zomato is a good app and great customer service.not much offers being given but Overall satisfied.",3
"Very good service with great customisation while synchronisation with intrest what I like to order, or what I will like to order preferred. Thanks for great experience...love from this side...keep your service like this",4
"I really like the app, and generally have had positive experiences but I had two bad experiences in just the last week where there were delivery issues and Zomato support didn't resolve the issues. Update: While those issues still remain, it would be unfair to rate them solely on that. 8 out of 10 times, they get it right wrt customer service.",4
Now Zomato is delivering in more than one hour even after showing in 30 minutes as the delivery man is now on cycles... Very poor service.... Last time order given.... Do not want to give even one star but no other option showing....,1
"At the last moment when my order was about to get delivered, i was informed that the restaurant has declined the order, till that time the app was showing the notification that my food was being prepared. This is the most irresponsible behaviour on zomato's part.",1
"I've been heavily dependent on Zomato from 2020 March since the covid started. Very easy to use app, alot of choices and discounts and very quick delivery. Thank you for being there, such a good experience enjoying food without having to Step out.",5
"If you start filter your cuisine, the keyboard keeps up front of the button to press apply.. this is one example of many functionality on user view that needs to be delighted carefully from my opinion.",3
"It has become quite expensive now, They charge exorbitant money in form of taxes and delivery charge now. I also regret purchasing zomato pro now as it render useless if your order is not above 500. All in all, I have switched to Swiggy.",1
Pathetic service and customer care sucks. You have to wait for more then 30 min to hear from them...if you are lucky then ok but if any order is missing or wrong delivery then its onto you. Delivery is too slow like that of a snail 🐌.,1
Nice app with useful features. But release-deployment needs to be streamlined. Recently frequent updates were rolled out in just within a week. This is inconvenient.,4
I love this app I've been frequently ordering food from Zomato for last one year and it has been a great experience. There have been instances when the food was not that good because of the restaurant but I got instant help from the Zomato chat support. Overall a great app,5
"The app is good but it needs to remove the option of by default giving donation for different foundations. If y'all want to put the option, give it a seperate page while ordering.",3
"Will not give you any rate. Its my first time using your app, its a garbage!!!! VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED!!! I used a promo code and got a discount then the restaurant cancelled my order because I didn't pay the FULL amount? What is the promo code for then? And now I need to wait 7days just to refund my money. Its a big NO for this app!!!",1
"Need ""meals for one"" section. Delivery surge is very high even if it's for one person. Delivery surge + delivery fee + taxes/restaurant packages= Rs200+ unnecessary charges have to be paid and result we get is low quantity food.",1
I order a food and I paid the full amount online..but I didn't receive my food...the delivery person didn't reach my location and simple close my order without my knowledge...I didn't receive my food..Im trying to call him he simply switch off his mobile.....my money also didn't receive back.......is this the way your handling your customers....worst experience....I have complained more then 10times..your customers service was worst...not even a single call is received from your customer service,1
This is my one and only favourite app of ordering food and i will never switch my zomato app with any other app . We get lots of orders but more then that zomato family is very strong aftr facing so much issue in this last 2 year zomato is still standing strong and thats what i respect the most .,5
Zomato never allow user to add its own address. Several times i have tried but failed. Using Google location never shows right address.,1
The service is good but they do not talk to the customer politely and there is always a confusion between the address And please open cash on delivery 🙏😁 If anyone don't have a account then pls 🙏🙏 open cash on delivery ... It's bad please open cash on delivery. Once the app has debited my rupees and the money is not returned and the order is also not received ever after but the money has gone.,2
OTP required if location is different. OTP not received. Food delivery takes time. This has happened twice. Address is correct but location selected by app is wrong.,3
Very Bad App. There is.a catch that without OTP card payment is through even if u accidently touch order button. Further no free cancellation is there.,1
Used to be good. Coupons are useless now. Prices are significantly higher than the restaurant's original price. Feels like getting cheated...,1
"Horrible experience, got a different dish from what i ordered. Contacted customer service asked for pictures sent twice. They want me to put my hands and show the dishes i received. Finally saying sorry we are unable to contact restaurant. When placing the order they can contact restaurant but after that cannot contact them.",1
It would be great if there was no surge during high demand period (eg : accepting orders above 300) which makes it difficult to order for a single person like me..,4
Very poor service they will keep you waiting for an hour and keep saying it is 10 min away from you. You will not able to call any delivery boy to ask where your food is and customer support is really pathetic.,1
Location changes automatically. The valet faces issue due to this. Please work on this part. Its pathetic. And my friends and I have faced issues multiple times due to it.,1
Very easy and simple to order compared to other apps. Order confirmation message is so good that it would never go unnoticed. Zooommmmmm ------‐----,5
Zomato is really doing great job. Sometimes when things goes wrong with food simply they it as there own respondinility to solve the issue. Even thought the concern restaurant/hotel don't respond for the fault. Hats off to Zomato team.,4
This is the worst app ever always when u get a good offer for food they will always put up this food cannot be delivered even if the restaurant is just 500m away from my home before i used to go and get food now covid and this money making scheme of zomato good be more self centered just wait for the pandemic to end you app will also end. WORST APP EVER.,1
It is a good application to use and for ordering food but problem is that all restaurants are not farely rated . There are many restaurants which provides below average food quality but had been 3-4star rated . And one more things to be noted is that Zomato pro is not that worthy for delivering of food since the restaurant which provides quality food are not included but all restaurants which provides below average food quality are included. So before placing order be sure and must check review.,4
"You service has degraded to the worst. Neither your delivery is upto the mark nor the customer service department. Everytime my order is late and I receive cold food. Top of it, your chat team makes me wait for 50 mins to give a resolution. In every alternate order, you guys fail to deliver complete order. Some or the other items keep on missing and if not missing them spillage is absolutely there. You guys suck! I have been using zomato for 3 years now and been a pro customer for a year now.",1
"The valets are great! The resolution is also good, but been experiencing some issues! Even though I face this, that too with low discounts, am using ZOMATO with less worries. I would appreciate if I receive better offers and better service overall!",3
"Hopeless, they don't know the management, each and every time the order got delayed and they say it is bcoz of Restaurants but the reason that they do not know how to manage the orders!!... I suggest order from Swiggy",1
Customer experience is very bad i ordered my food about 40 minutes ago and it was showing 39 min left then i checked after 39 min from my clock it was still showing 16 min left even after 40 min passed on clock. I asked valet he told me he was delivering another order. He didn't even picked my order. Poor management and fake timings shown always.,1
Bring back the take out option.. Atleast we can order from the restaurant and bring the order from the restaurant without having to wait in a queue.. That option was nice.. But it seems to be unavailable now.. Bring it back..,3
I don't have zero or negative rating option that is why gave 1 star. They will never ever deliver your order on time. They will always increase expected time or make you wait for the order.,1
once if order is placed it cant be change or cancelled thats a drawback. Zomato chat is not working all the time. Plus they return if order is missing. They dont value there customers they take excess delivery charges,2
This is the worst app ever to order food online it should remove the restaurants that do not accept orders at any time of the day...... Wasted my time and data to download it..... Would have given it no star if i could..... Don't download it. 😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😈😈😈My money was cut from my account and the food never arrived. Wasted my money too..Why do the promo codes don't work.... It says 50% off on my first order.... 😠,1
The delivered products were not with outer package plus one item was missing which was confirmed at the time of booking. Very bad service!,1
I ordered food from one restaurant and it's been more than 2 and half hour it is still not rrecieved they have one number registered there which is busy from 2 hours and Zomato people also don't have any alternative number of the restaurant which is so unprofessional I feel. Giving 1 star for the team who verifies resturant and there contact details. Really I never expected this from Zomato,1
The app is ok but it doesn't show you the astimated time for food to arrive anymore and that No cancelation rule is annoying since you are under the restaurant mercy It is just about getting money from the customer no no matter what,3
"Price of the food is to high as it should not be , and the time they take for preparing the food is too much , but hence it's a good app !",3
"Pathetic app and pathetic support. Received an order with the missing itme. The vendor has 2 contact numbers. Both were out of service. The delivery boy replied to contact the vendor. And the Zomato supports last statement was, ""it was an exception"". Nothing after that....😠",1
While ordering and payment it was showing 26 min to deliver. Even after 30min from ordered time it was showing still 18 min to deliver. It always shows wrong timing for delivery i.e. Zomato delivery time will not clock as our clock works.,1
"I like the service of Zomato very much and found of it. Also, the discounts which I get are cool 😎😎😎. Till date the services were good and the delivery boys are also good.",4
"Good. Fast delivery. But amount in cash on delivery should be available for all amount. Also we may be allowed to pay any amount to your staff in addition to your fixed amount of Rs 30, 50 etc",4
"Very very bad service. My order was cancelled even though the delivery person could've have handed over my order to the security guard, when he was unable to reach me and they went ahead and deducted the money as well.",1
"I had purchased Gold membership which was switched to Pro membership when I started using Zomato. Though the delivery services are fine, the Pro membership Is as good as general account. There's no point of paying extra bucks to get like no good benefits.",2
I was very happy at my 1st order because I got a welcome coupon and also my order was at same price with resturant. But than when I tried to make another order every dish price became so high. I mean I saw a dish price worth 104Rs I add it to my cart when I check my crat dish price became 130Rs and with tax and other things the total price became 205Rs wow. Like seriously 😑 and not with only this dish or resturant with every dish I notice that. Fake price wrote on dish. 👎🏻,1
Worst food delivery app out there. In one word will describe them as corrupt. They take orders claiming to deliver them in 30 mins and then will make you wait for hours. Happened thrice with me.,1
"The support is really a pain. I got the order delivered late, informed to support person and he till 30mins kept on hold for responding throughout the chat.had this platform given pics to upload I would have shown it.",1
Good app Polite attitude of delivery boy. Fast and clean delivery sometimes before time. I loved this app and the delivery person for their behaviour. May god bless those delivery person who are supporting their family,4
"It is really nice.. always up to date with options, map, suggestions etc.. and the delivery and deliveryman were on time.. showing exact time to delivering order.. Keep it up..",4
Worst of its kind. There's no customer service. Told me to write a mail. There's no response it's been 2 days since i sent that mail. Ticket ID is 8024028,1
"I like the format of your app..u provide the address, hygiene rating and also picture of the place we are ordering from, in today's scenario it helps to decide whether we want to order from here or no.",5
"After long-term Swiggy Super Customer. Now started using Zomato as Pro. The App looks very great & perfect. Especially dine-out restaurant suggestions was great. Easy ordering & delivery facility. Overall a good experience. On negative side.. Compared to swiggy it's a bit over-priced. In a swiggy, after offer we can order food for one person @ the rate of Rs.100 whereas it's not at all possible here. Minimum order value never went below 150 till now. Kindly look into this.",4
Delivers all expired items daily. I think this makes money like this fooling customers waste app to waste your money as there will be not a single resolution for bad quality. It doesnt deliver order and make delivery with restaurant valet which dont deliver at all,1
This app will charge extra amount in ame of delivery charges and taxes. Customer service will not answer and of ur question. They even claim for offers which u will not find on app. They just want to emplty pockets of customer,1
"The only most trusted app for ordering food online! I'll give it that. Love the interface of the app, couldn't be more convenient.",4
"totally loved almost all the items that we have tried.....corn kernels, moghlai paratha, mutton biryani, fish finger, hariyali chicken tikka. waiting for more nengali items to be added on the menu. the rolls however miss out on authenticity of kolkata.",5
"Location issues and I used my home location and it show delivery to another address ( completley Stupid) And I immediately informed to rider that address wrong and informed to Zomato and he told order cancelled and u have to pay cancellations fee , Question to Zomato ( I mentioned my address and why it show other address and after all u chage the cancellation fee!! Why ???? Completley Nonsense....",1
"Much better than Swiggy! I really appreciate that they deliver on time although a tad bit more expensive, I don't really mind as service is very good. Been a Swiggy user tor years now, and have switched to Zomato now. Very happy sith the service!",5
There is no option given for the customers to cancel their order soon after the order has been place. A minimal time should be given to cancel the placed order but there is no such option given.,2
"Very bad service from the customer helpline. I had ordered veg Biryani but received some dosa. On repeated calls to the delivery boy as well as several msgs on the customer helpline, none of them were available to answer or deliver the right items. Horrible. Swiggy is much better on that grounds.",1
"Awsome app. It differs from swiggy is that, you can order to different address from your current location. Really easy to use app. I love this app.",5
"earlier the app was working fine, but suddenly it shows only veg and egg and doesn't show or allow any other non veg items to order, searched the app thoroughly for any preferences I set, but I didn't find any",2
I always take the food from outside... And recently I switched from Switch to Zomato for food order... But here the pro benefits works after 300₹+ order... And I do order only for myself...Now I'm feeling it's total waste to buy the pro... All these services are taking advantage of customers that's all which I noticed till now.,1
"Good food, good life. I personally felt that zomato always give some fantastic offers which helps to save some extra money. And also its service is too good. I am totally satisfied with its services and offers. 💯👌",5
Tired of complaining about the faults in most orders..all they do is hand over a coupon that you could use with other order but dude what about customer satisfaction..if this is gonna be the condition you are gonna lose your customers just like fire spreading over dry grass. Nobody wants their food imperfectly..we are paying you all you have to do is give us properly what we payed for...also the prices are much higher than the actual ones..all taxes other stuff makes the cost much higher..,1
"Overall good, but they can reduce the taxes specifically for international food chains like kfc ,dominno and many more. And also remove restaurants from lists that do not provide quality food and are just there to trick customers and make money.",1
Ordering through Zomato is so easy and comfortable. No issues with the system. Everytime the food arrives on time. Thankyou team zomato for always making my experience wonderful!,5
Pathetic service by Zomato. Had mentioned the complete address but the delivery boy and customer care executive asked me to drive more than one kilometre to collect the order. Customer care executive was very rude and told that in case I do not come to collect order they will cancel the order and will also not refund the money. Will never order thru Zomato. Swiggy is far better Pathetic service pathetic behaviour,1
"Excellent experience so far but, it's getting bad in terms of discounts on offer. Not that worth now and Pro subscription is a hit or a miss so far.",3
Now a days their delivery system is very very poor. Customers has to wait for longer periods and they neither give any free delivery nor any offers for further orders. Very disappointing service so choose a better option guys,2
zomato must stop showing amount that you have saved this much & this amount etc. people are smart enough to understand how much they would have saved by actually calling the hotel itself or collect the parcel. if you want to genuinely give discount then give it on actual hotel menu price and not with the other rosy picture. even a 15 year boy or girl knows how much a pizza or burger costs without delivery charge and all the other pro and cashback jazz etc. if you are really commited to customes.,3
customer support is very poor.... they haven't able to help. I am using Zomato since 2017 but first time i have face issue and contact with customer support but they haven't able to resolve. I am going to uninstall the app. worst experience ever.,1
"The delivery was on time and the food was intact & still warm. Thanks to Mr.Ismail, the delivery guy🙏 Thanks to Zomato apps, it's easy to used, with the tracking monitor. 👌",5
"My experience was very bad, one fourth of my food portion was stolen by the rider. I Always order from faasos, but one time I found a great deal on Zomato for the same food I always order from faasos tempted and I ordered, after receiving the package are found that the package has been opened and some quantity of food was also missing . Zomato takes money from the restaurant takes money from the customer but still gives one of the worst service.",1
This is just an app. You can order food at your own risk.The customer service team also helpless when your meal is late. So what is the benifit of their customer service.,1
It gives me worst service. It takes took long time. As it is covid I order in online. But poor service. They are picking 2 order at same it took 2 hours for me to receive my order. Waste of time.,2
"Sometimes I can't find my preferred hotel to be online, but few minutes later its online. But by then i have already ordered from somewhere else. They should look into it.",4
The experience on zomato is getting worse and worse. If delivery is mot possible then why xomato accepts the order. And after that... Money is not getting refunded. Please dont do such type of huge mistakes in buisness . Its a humble request on behalf of all customers we appreciate all zomato services from ages. Please dont ruin the brand name. But as of now i am switching over to diffrent food app now.,1
"Ordered worth Rs.1080, the food was entirely crushed and box was dropped. Pizza overlaping the other. Instead of offering to replace it, they are offering me Rs.599 refund for the spillage. So not only do I get to arrange for another meal now, I also do not get back the entire sum of money. Thanks for your service. Very disrespectful and hurtful.",1
Bought Zomato pro as you guys promised extra discount. But sad to see that min order of 300 was not mentioned prior. I'm not getting any discount for any orders even an a price of 250+. I basically have to pay more in other to get more discount?!!! Extremely ridiculous! Really sad service team and is probably one of the biggest scams to retort extra money. I have many orders from you. Can check my history. This is no way to scam regular customers. Shame on you.Instead of email plz reply here!,1
"Very hopeless app,If u could not serve in time than it should be shown while ordering.These idiots showed that so and so party hotel could not complete/refused your order after performing online transaction.",1
Fabulous on-time service an very user-friendly interface. Policies around discount and customer care support is also great.,5
Prices in restaurants menu and theirs have vast difference for example 2 items ordered directly from the restaurant will cost 270 and ordered from them will cost 350 its a crappie app with no money saving and just lures you with fake discount offers.,1
"No option given to write your grivience if you don't get food on time. When you open support chat option, AI is chating with you. Can't write what you want to write.",1
"I gave one rating only because of irresponsible restaurant tied up. Few are really good but whenever I tried ordering from new place it is always the worst experience, even I uave shared the infividual review for the same. Zomato Service is good but not good restaurant partner. Need to work on it Zomato. Best Reviewer are not the one who reply to our comment, but it is the one who act on it immediately. Not at all interested to write any email Excellent service provider with worst quality.",1
It's all good until the minimum order value due to high demands occurs while you order. These demands are fake as it's almost always shown & there are no high demands in any other apps. Requesting zomato to fix it properly if you guys want better customer reviews,1
Yesterday ordered food. They reach destination through location on map which is a robotic approach. Half an hour i had to guide the valet. It was a cumbersome experience altogether,1
"Off late, Zomato is just not very cautious with their deliveries. I have received parcel with missing items in three consecutive orders. Zomato should make sure that their partners are following instructions.",3
Food delivery time is always on time. But carrying the food items by valets are not hygiene way...most carrying food by hanging to their vehicles in open covers which makes full of dust and also unhealthy. They should carry food in closed bags with santised every time..,2
"The best app for food I have seen. If we have any issues with delivery, packing or quality, Zomato helps quickly in compensating which I loved the most in this app.",5
Online tracking system is very bad to find vallet to find exact location and tracking also very poor. Have lots of new vallets didn't know the city very well and getting difficulties to find out location.,3
Offers on zomato are just amazing.We can order food in just a minimal amount.The delivery is faster than swiggy.Offers make food from the top restaurants affordable for everyone.just loved it....,4
"It was an awesome experience to receive food that we enjoy and delivered in time even in Covid times. Great to have such an option handy, always!",5
"I usually not interested to give ratings an all for any app, but once I had issue with one food order regarding quantity and I contacted zomato representives through chat, their response was too good and solved the problem immediately and I loved that quick response.",5
"The restaurants are getting worse. Wrong items are getting way more frequent. It's like a monopoly, that whatever you order, they deliver what they want in that.",1
3 hours and they could not deliver. I called the restaurant and they said do whatever. Support did not help. 5 minutes later I received a message saying order delivered! Order came at 11 pm and I refused to take it. Never pay in advance.,1
Zomato has reworked on this app by aptly dealing with the bugs experienced in the previous version. Now it allows us to freely explore the choice of foods n restaurants as per our convenience n choice. Keep it up Zomato!!🙂,5
"Ordered food but forgot to apply promocode I asked to cancel the order so that I can apply promocode and order again, I asked customer support to cancel in the very next second but they charged me Rs.75 stating that food is already being prepared. However I cancelled the order but when u try to order again it didn't show any of the offers. This all happened in just 5mins. VERY DISAPPOINTED.",1
"Great app for delivery. We don't get food delivery in Goa from any restaurant, luckily Zamato does that work for us, even for the smallest order. Thank you",5
"If you opt for on time delivery , even though delivery is not on time they will not refund your money even after sharing the proof , simply they will argue, not recommend my friends to order food from it",1
"There is a bug. In just a difference of 8 meters it is showing order not deliverable, which ideally should not be the case.",1
"Now that it's been a long time, I would love to rate Zomato it's a mixed experiences I had faced with them, I had not got two orders delivered by the time I doesn't know much about Zomato care and left off, got wrong order but as I came go to know about redressal system I got refunded overall satisfied.",4
"Good food at pocket freindly prices.Its a food revolution in India by Zomato.I reckon the App is a boon to someone who wants to have good,tasty food from a variety of Hotels at an astonishingly competitive price.Zomato is my best friend when it comes to Chinese Food.Keep it up Zomato.",5
I ordered food today from parantha zone using my idfc first card which gave me a dicount of 150rs...Payment failed for some reason nd without my consent the payment mode was changed giving me 0 discount.This has happened so many times before too nd zomato always shrugs its responsibility .,1
"Excellent food delivery and dining app. But sometime it shows :--Zomato is not working .close it now! So, the app need a slight improvement.",5
App is not user friendly. Ratings are misleading. I have experienced that the hotels rated more than 4 serve horrible food. Hotels like Taj and Paradise are rated four and above but there food is hopeless. Its just waste of money. Zomato should include hotels within radius of 10 kilometres to customer's location and charge accordingly.,3
Everything is good but the price is really very high for one person one has to spend almost 300 to get meal for one time you dont think this is very high.,3
Photo and vehicle number of delivery boy should be displayed to the customer. All food items are not listed Some items (including some main items) are missing from menu,2
"Very user friendly app as well as very convenient to set the payment mode. I am traveling from USA, swiggy did not recognize my international credit card or local debit card.",5
Zomato is good. Timely delivered orders most of times. Response of any difficulty is quick time. Overall good experience.,5
"Quite an improvement. Good app. But offers are ok, not impressive. Delivery charges and taxes jack up the price.",4
This place never fails to amaze me. the food quality is still great. 5 stars service .exceptionally clean. cozy ambiance . prices are reasonable .hats off 👏👏👏👏,5
"Multiple times faced delivery was toooo late , not even update to customers order is delay , when we ask they reply won't happen again and they make fools by giving promo codes... Look some alternative apps for food delivery.",1
Sometimes it doesn't accept all methods of payment and there should be a feature of letting customer know the approximate time of preparing the food.,4
Very very fast delivery. They have improved services a lot. Decent and nice attitude of delivery boy. App is really very easy to use.😍,5
Well Played Zomato. Delivery charges directly increases to 150% from old charge. I am regular user of this application but now because of this cost increases too much.. stopped ordering products ..,1
"Now-a-days app doesn't work good.Many of the times I open app,it says 'currently we aren't accepting any orders'.Also the app is very slow and don't immediately shows about order details even after payment is completed.",2
"Good packaging, timely delivery. NO WASABI.... a no! NO! WITH sushi. It is a must go item. Disappointed at first trial. Bento's have paid better attention to detail",3
"This App always gives me good experience, best discounts, fast deliveries and their customer care also attends very well. I never felt wastage of my money or time. Zomato You will always remain installed on my phone 👍",5
"Cake was adorable and intact.bravo to Zomato with a big 🍅 tomato.😂.....the best part was ever packaging material was echo friendly. Next order a cake only with iceing I would prefer because their was only cake and no icing.,.... any way we have to chill-out.... beautiful world",5
Worst quality food items from your app. Experienced twice in a day from back to back 2 orders from 2 different points i.e. from Domino's & from food@99 where I ordered of around Rs.2000 but found quality of level zero. This proofs that Zomato fails to deliver quality to their customers. So disappointment from Zomato. Regards... Virendar Bhandari,1
I am fully satisfied with zomato...i have found too many bugs in swiggy...but i didnt find any heavy bugs in zomato...the service is too fast and better compared to swiggy...keep doing 👍🏻,5
"Excellent and delicious food. Very good quality, ideal quality and taste. Must have items. Super fast delivery, even in peak time, by Zomato team.👍",5
This rating is not for the app but for the company! Hiking the prices for the food and then saying there is a 50% discount is not a good marketing strategy. It is called cheating!,1
"Zomato is great for exploring nearby restaurants, but the app could be improved. Dark mode, one time prompt to login, see available restaurants in Maps, more elaborated filtering such as sorting by number of reviews, sorting by distance in collections. Edit: I find it incredibly irritating how often this app refreshes even if it's just clicking back to search from a restaurant page. I have to add my filters again and scroll back to where I was.",3
Worst app. It aumatocally deducts money without asking for OTP. Please do not install it. The delivery is slow and always out of the time they promise.,1
"I am happy with the customer care service, they are quick n fast , replying on time , good response in the related concern, delivery person should be smart to track the location. I order food from Leon grill with the correct delivery location n he wasn't able to find my place it was next to Leon grill just 2mins away, delivery person tried telling I have put wrong location but when I connect the customer care , he had to come n I showed my address which is clearly mentioned then he apologized.",5
"I would like to rate you negative. Vallet takes long that shown time to deliver or comes after delivering 2-3 orders or item is missing and when you complain to customer care about same, they will console you by adding a Rs 50 coupon to account. Please tell me how a Rs 50 coupon can compensate my spoiled order of Rs 500, time, energy? The app has added a new feature, ETA will get update as per the convenience of rider and then customer care will tell you,your order will be delivered in ETA.",1
Very Bad experience with zomato horrible 2 times recieved rotten food. 2 times delivery delayed due to merge with other deliveries out of 4 orders. Even the app is manupulative. location of the delivery man shows near my area before payment but after payment delivery man went to deliver another package....,1
I love this app over any other food delivery app. Other reason is its employee and customer handling procedure. I have been following past few conflicts between customers and employees in news. I appreciate how Zomato handels such matters. I am a happy customer of Zomato.,5
Very good..only problem I faced with my last order where I didn't get all the items..2 items were missing and after reporting to zomato there was no response even after multiple reminders,5
It is a good app its very useful for the people like us who are staying away from their homes. It provides certain discount so u can get food at very affordable prices,3
Worst app Worst services Worst customer care.I order 2 plates of biriyani by 7:30 today Delivery time was 8:37I started chatting with. Customer service By then. Initially one person told 25 mins extra time it will take. If you have concerns call to the hotel Directly. I called that hotel 10 times it's behroz briyani. This order by 10:30 zomoto called me and asked to cancel as the restaurant not piking the order. By 10:45 they have updated this order is already delivered.,1
"This latest update on the app interrupts the music playing on your phone! I'd have given it a zero star rating, but then I am dependent on it",4
"Always loads properly. Never had a problem. Recommended, best sellers, chef's specials are very useful tags. Frequently Ordered with.., your previous orders are useful information.",5
"Easy to use , delivery is prompt , delivery boys are professional and observe safety norms , generally tension free , good places to order from . Good experience",5
"Love the app and help desk is excellent , any spillage or spoilt food refund process is great , less erorrs are expected . Very helpful app specially during this pandemic situation.",5
"Love it. Though recommendation is to add more restaurants & mini shops like ice cream parlours, snacks, etc.",5
Great app. Works very fine in this pendamic situation as well. Giving one rating less as it is adding extra taxes on order other than delivery charges.,4
Fantastic app. Has helped us celebrate birthdays even during lockdown by allowing us to order cakes and food from our favorite restaurants. The offers only make it more better 😜,5
Pathetic app ...the delivery guy only calls once or twice and the order was cancelled ..Now thr is no refund of the order..what type of policy is this and no reorder is also thr .... Really not expected this from Zomato ...hence uninstalling the app...and making sure not to order from it again .,1
"Good and great but could give more options of variety of restaurants ,like which other than pro option,tell us which is the best among other normal restaurants including their taste and customer most preferred choices...other than this I love this app❤️🤗",5
It's was very great experience with zomato. I liked it a lot. Great service. Fast response. We are very much Satisfied. Thank you🙏 Zomato and Team.,5
Very much high priced and even the delivery charges never I would prefer zomato at all. I very well know to check taxes and charges have done that already compared to other food delivery apps yours is way too much,1
Items are missing during night time. I got wrong food so many times. They are not taking against delivery boy and restaurant.kindly don't repeat this again and again.zomato will lose the good name.,1
"Order was paid before my confirmation. I can't say from which account of mine payment was taken, that too without OTP. And for 20/- payment for delivery boy, Zomato is asking for OTP.",3
"I am giving Zomato 1 stars because of their behaviour. I have their pro membership, but whenever I gave the order their employees are not giving me the priority for my order they are coming late and when I escate this 2 their helpdesk team (which they don't have Tollfree) only chat option is available for us. So when I chat with their team they simply saying that sir I am sorry that you face this issue and they offer me a cash back voucher for the delay. I ahve lot to say but charcter limits ove",1
Don't order food in restaurant closing time... they won't prepare food only... they will cancel it after sometime....and that will be already late. You can't get outside also... Because of zomato my ill sister is sleeping hungry now... i am helpless. This is what the situation zomato created..,1
"Sometimes rotten food. Sometimes unnecessary deductio of money. Specially don't try single click payment options, you would be taxing and they would release your order.",1
"Food is little expensive on app. If u go and purchases the food , prices are less and in zomato same food from same restaurant If u order prices are 30 percent high exclusive of delivery and taxes.",3
There is no any complain no.. So they don't refund the money.. I have given the address of jamshedpur but the agent is calling from other city so i cancelled the order but they haven't given my money back & i have checked the address which was correct but they denied to refund.. It is not acceptable & it is a fraudulent activities.. Never expected this.. Don't use this type of applications,1
"Great experience. Delivery Dada's are very polite, obliged and hard working. But I would like to request zomato not to incorporate any substandard restaurant that will reduce zomato's good will.",5
"Your rates are hiked and then given discounts to customers. This is absolutely cheating and cheap marketing. A restaurant in our locally Shanthi Sagar"" in their counter they are charging set dosa at Rs 45 but the same set dosa you guys are charging at 60 rupees and then giving discounts. Could you explain this to me, what kind of a policy is this. I have noticed this point with all your hotels and restaurants appearing in Zomata. Please stop this at once and offer some genuine menus.",1
Awesome customer support with asking refund there provides refund and also provide you food very genuine app if you're genuine 😃😃 i know most of the people gives bad ratings because like a Bagger they ask refund money after eating food otherwise i never faced any kind if issues by zomato really appreciated your work Zomato in this crucial pendmic they are providing food on time that is big things when everyone is sacre to go out side we are getting food at our home salute fir your work zomato,5
"I have very bad experience with zomato in past few months, they are very irresponsible and also no one is available to listen and solve your issue. They provide worst food facility. Once your order get delivered after that they don't take responsibility for the order, food is good or spoiled no matter. They want only money and don't care about customer's health. I wasted money 2 times and my advice to others is never order through ZOMATO. 🤮🤮🤮",1
"Don't depend on this app, they literally take 1hour to deliver food. Not just in 1instance, it happened n no.of times. And support is also very pathetic, hope this review helps new customers",1
"I find zomato better than swiggy or any other food ordering app. It has general overview, reviews, location & address of resturant, dining menu along with the food delivery.",5
Prices of food are higher at zomato than the restaurants original price and the delivery charges are very high. Other delivery systems doesn't have that much of delivery charges.,2
"Great app, convenient to use and also delivery guys keep up a good behaviour with customer, My request to customer to provide some tip to the delivery guys as they are working in festival also to deliver you good food.",4
Better update the app with the exact location and reaching time. The time shown is not accurate. But the delivery boy reached on time. Please don't spoil there effort.,3
"Sometimes order won't come because of some bad delivery services.. Delivery man says"" We r on the way... We r on the way and at last they won't pick up the phone then we have to cancel the order.. We talked to one food spot, they said that some delivery boy pick the order from the spot and didn't update it on the app when customer asked about the parcel they said that order is not update on the app then we won't come.. Finally we have to cancel the order.",4
Your app is so slow it took me 20 minutes to place an order!! And no its not the internet speed. Everything else was working fine. You suck big time!,1
"App interface on issues, some times all restaurants closed,refresh again all restaurants open confused past two weeks I am facing this problem, more than times I am uninstall re-install, I hope this problem early to close,",5
"You cant cancel your order without being charged for it , I forgot to add a promo code so needed to camcel and place the order again but it said i cant because theyve started preparing it. Atleast have a counter before confirming an order !",1
"Exceptional Delivery option for people like who are quarantine, though swiggy was my first preference but it didn't work out due some reason. Happy to use Zomato here after.",5
"Customer support is horrible, paid bill ammount or receiving receipt is different, I want to contact customer care for this issue, but chat option is not available, only computerized sentence are available, how can I complain my bill issue,, terrible",1
"Worst service I have ever had, when i reached for food quantity issue and product change issue, i have only advised to be given 100rs of over 350 rs product but the quantity is not even worth 100rs. And also they didnt gave the refund as promised. They left me unattended in the chat window for more than 2 hrs with my constant msging. When i reached via mail for some half refund thrice, they didnt responded and asked me to leave it as an exception.Exctive Prince jain is the worst exc. Worst exp.",1
This application helps a lot and saves time. Also the delivery of the order was also on time. 👌👍,5
"Some restaurants the delivery charge is 6dh, which does not even go to the rider. Thinking of reducing the orders on Zomato. Even if there is no discount better order direct or just take away.",2
Very happy with this app. Gives a detailed information about every restaurant. Their team knows how to handle customer complaints. Overall very happy.Cheers,5
This is totally funtastic app. I am in love with Zomato. Every time .. I like i should order sth. Totally good app. Very polite delivery boys. Everytime i receive my order at right time. I am very satisfied with Zomato.💜,5
"A good restaurant. Staff at hostess desk were helpful but not excited or joyful. The food was average. Sicilian Arancini Rice balls were very tasty, but nothing to brag about. We were served the same with a orange pink sauce but no tea spoon was given. The pizza diavola was again a simple normal pizza nd nothing to take home as a story. This was served with no ketch up. The salt nd pepper set on the table was unhygienic. The quarter plate served to us for having starter was dirty",3
"Small orders are not accepted on peak hours. It asks you to add more food so, that they can sum up too min 500/- for a person..I will better cook and save that 500/-",2
Service and resturant options are good. But delivery charges are weird. Resturant very close to home shouldn't entertain any delivery charges when tips facilitiy is available.,3
"very very poor service, this is 3rd time i had bad experience. food is open and packing is leaked, Zomato people are reluctant to Revert or give any solution. neither we can expect any improvement i would suggest people yo Look out for Other company App or whatever. bit don't go for Zomato. they are absolute wicked vahiyaaat sergixe",1
Very bad service i have order first time on zomato and valet is saying he doesn't have knowledge about my order and i have talked to support team is saying that there is technical issue but shopkeeper is saying your food is ready but noone is here to pick my order tillnow i didn't receive my order and i have order on 2:01 PM But Now time is 3:37 PM and till now i didn't receive my food now they are sending cool pizza and burger.,1
"The app always makes me happy and ofcourse my tummy too. Thumbsup for The new feature of ""request home delivery"" - hope it will be heard by the restaurants.",5
Before it was good but now it does not allow to apply coupon code. I tried applying code that I got from phonepe reward but it shows not available wth. I want this to be fixed now,1
Very bad when it come to refund it's more than 2 month I didn't got my refund of 176 n agent everytime asking me to wait for 48 hrs. Very disappointed.,1
This is one of the best application if you want to order food online as well check out nearby restaurants snd they do have some good reviews. I will prefer Zomato over any other food application.,5
Kindly improve your tracking system in the application because when a valet is stuck for more time at a place it's a concern for us that maybe he is replacing the order with low quality If you're Capable of improving do it I'm not writing any of your email service,1
Payment through Debit card always create problem. It do not accept. I have tried 20 times but it always reject payment. Rates are quite high. After charging high rates they also expect to give aome tip to the rider.,3
"They should just get out of delivery business. It's not their cup of tea. Edit 1 (2 years later) - Guess what, everything's still the same. They suck at deliveries and their support is legendarily bad. Still feel they should get out of this business. (23/04/2021)",1
Good service but why are you providing promo codes in phone pay app while applying codes it is say invalid code what is the use of giving offers in phone pay.. It is 5th time that happens to me..,2
"I've got it to give it to Z, the new UI and constant feature rollout is super impressive. It makes discovery very interesting, very thoughtful features on the delivery, and great visual content.",5
I was using many food delivery app. But this one is the best...Genuine food delivery app having lot of discount offers and refund policy....I really appreciate your sincere work...Thank you !!,5
I'm using this app from very long time and I must say it is very excellent app. I just have one issue regarding coupons and price. Overall the app is perfect.,4
"Have a very good experience, It would be great if Zomato should have its personal Zomato wallet for cashbacks/reward cards/reward points, because some time cashback sent to Paytm a user can't use and please give a free delivery in this pandemic or create some packages for free delivery.",4
"What a great services I have experienced today, I have ordered a cake as today's my daughter's first birthday and I have seen that insead of cream cake it came dry cake, I asked delivery boy to this is not that item which I was ordered so he suggested that cancel the order and order again, when I cancelled the order than I got to know that amount will not refunded and against that amount I am not able to order any other item as well. Means my amount is deducted and not received anything.",1
Prices are too other than the actual prices listed in the hotel.. it is 100% higher.. i raised this concern already with the proper bill from the hotel but no response.. always go to hotel directly...,1
Your public relations have improved a lot from when i started to use this app and the app also helps me find affordable places. keep up the good work.,5
Very poor customer service. Worst app ever. Just money sucker people are here. In the name of pro they take the money but when it actually come to help they will be gone. Posted issue on instagram it's been 3-4 days no one replied and still waiting. I wish I had option to give negative ratings.,1
"More than 3 times i ordered food and its always delayed never on time, so bad experience, if u want to order add at least 20 to 30 min delay , so frustrating",1
Worst app..i order my food but by mistake i did one 1 extra dosa which is not required there is no option to cancle such things and also have too beer canclation charges..so dont want to use this app further and suggest my friend not to use it.worst app..i will.use another app..worst worst wprst,1
"Pretty nice app , using from past 3 years but the customer service is really bad and there is no use even after sending an email to Zomato , please try to upgrade from that level",3
One bug is there in latest update. That is when ever I am placing an order the app update is triggered and app stuck and we need to force close this. Please look into it. Mobile: Oppo F17 Pro,5
Love Zomato.. wonderful experience.. the promo codes and pro discounts makes me keep coming back.. and the delivery ppl are also very sweet and polite always. And I have always had an amazing experience every single time .. .,5
"This is the best food delivery app compared to likes of swiggy... Lot of restaurants options and always some discounts to offer. I wanted a cake from sassy teaspoon and I found this bakery on Zomato after trying all other food apps. They also provide good options for coupon discount. Their customer service is right on spot addressing any query and providing resolution on the spot. So happy with service 🙂 The food delivery executives are quite good, never faced any issue with them.",5
I don' t even find a single restaurant for delivery to my location and it always show no restaurants found for delivery that too only in my phone and in others phone it shows delivery option. Worst app designed,1
"Overall experience is very great with this app. I order from it nearly daily. Except once, I ordered a sandwich and got ill after eating it, So to Zomato please be careful from places like that.",5
Worst experience ..food items i ordered was not delivered fully.. Half of items was missing although they took money for entire order... When i contact to costumer care they did not gave any solution after i repeatedly aaking for the same... Large scale of frauds of missing item at zomato.. Am uninstalling dis app.,1
Always had a great experience with Zomato. Excellent UI for ordering food. Wide variety of cuisines and locations. Great for home deliveries. Polite and efficient delivery staff.,5
You order something and in return you will get something else..and you have no proper medium to contact them..if you use chat option..you will get automated system response. Swiggy is far better,1
The order is not delivered properly some items are missing. Even the app didn't share the correct order to the restaurant.,1
Zomato delivery service is too good....only Zomato is helping for when I am hungry but couldn't going to any restaurant then Zomato bring the same restaurant food at my home and it was too fast ....I am really thankful to Zomato services and I am really like it....,5
good but options are less and also offers are less as compare to other app. Taxes are charged more. If we make order for 350 after taxes the order goes up to 450. Kindly reduce ur taxes. Even delivery is charged,3
It offers a variety of delicious dishes at all times of the day i.e. you can order 24×7 from here. This is the best part which I liked about it!!,5
"I like it's simple interface, It has great deals on most of the restaurants.. Provide good service and fast deliveries.. Thats Awesome..👌🏻👌🏻",5
Awesome app and the delivery is on time most of the times. I would rate it 5 stars if you give all deliveries on time.,4
Till now I had great experience with zomato's customer services as well as good food ...A great app to order food and easy to use ..I hope my experience will always be the same with you thanks zomato for your services😊🥰,4
When you raise a complaint about missing food from the restaurant the Zomato executive will jump to refund the amount and not bother to resolve your concern. Throwing money at customer is the mode to resolve rather than choose partners and logistics with integrity. My first and last order was this one. Hopeless,1
I have 3 times very bad experience with Zomato. Sometimes they delay your order so much. Items missing from your order. Restaurant owner told they give all items.,1
"Unwanted charges, too much delivery charge,can't place order because of your high demand that you impose on each restaurant. a fixed amount for placing order uninstalling Zomato.",1
The services is pathetic. I usally order prepaid food and sometime i dont even get that when i called the delivery guy they hang up my call.you guys dont even have the customer care number now and your customer support services ppl are dumb.when i said them i dont get my food the suggested me to write an email will get you assure solution with 24 to 48 working hours like really. The guys is sitting at his place with empty stomach. When he alredy paid for the food and now he has to write an email,1
"its service and vallets are very unresponsive. uber and SWIGGY are performing extremely well I recently ordered food for different locations and the delivery boy was not reachable. they have cancelled the order and debited my money. 2nd instance. Wrote to Zomato, got 3 scripted replies. very bad service on road and backoffice Service have started worsen",1
Looting clients . Orders are not delivered properly. Normal restaurant rates are lower than that shown in Zomato respective hotel menu. Delivery charge for order within 0.50 km is also 35 rs. Absolute loot,2
No option to talk to an agent? Why is customer service not there? Am I supposed to put up with an automated system asking me again and again what my issue is and then asking for feedback??,1
I think Zomato is one n only the best food app in the county right now with excellent team of support and riders all are doing a great work they always give is best and fast service on time even the chat support staff of Zomato are quite decent in understanding our issues thnku so much keep up the good work I wish to continue orders even after my death😂💞,5
I must say I'm quite unsatisfied in recent times usage of this app because of pricing. There's no real advantage with pro membership. YOU STILL CHARGE FOR DELIVERY.,2
"Delivery locations and rates are not as per the UberEats, also delivery is too late. Map location in Zomato app is not proper, showing other location everytime",3
"No technical support for app not working properly. App didn't work, got it updated but still same issue. Had to uninstall and again install the app.",3
"Cheating of delivery timing in most of the orders. While placing order, it will show some time for delivery. If getting delay automatically delivery time will increase and they will show some delivery time",3
prices are reasonable compared before. Now everything looks expensive and service chatges re high even though we dont use there sitting area!!!!,5
"Terrible service 7 times out of 10. Deliver exceeds ETA all the time. When complained, response is usually very dull or none at all.",1
"Other than delivery charges being little high, I highly recommend this app to everyone to buy foods in India. Nice app, very responsible support team, realtime tracking. Kudos. Thanks!",5
Very bad experience....it's being long time no any update from the restaurant....neither the numbers is reachable....nor the customer support is replying on time....what's happening,1
"Superb service by Zomato, Zomato takes lot of good initiatives for social welfare as well especially I liked the feature Covid-19 delivery option, literally its way way better than swiggy and other food delivery apps.",5
"I dont understand when i was a gold member for 2 yrs, why wasn't i offered an annual renewal rather just 3 months renewal only. Atleast those customers who joined zomato as gold customers (now pro) when the scheme was started should be given that cover for being a loyal customer.",3
Before covid zomato was very good. Now these day's over charge and after subscription of zomato pro they charge for delivery not only for far location near by also zomato is charging too much. Now recent days its better no use zomato then they can realise customer value.,3
I ordered food on a daily basis. But there was always a problem using the promo code pls don't overlook it . Although the service is quite good,3
"Good food is what gets you through life. Zomato is a godsend app. The delivery is on time, whenever there is an error/goof-up the customer service is so courteous and make amends. They compensate handsomely. I feel lucky to be a citizen resident of India, thanks to apps like Zomato that make life richer",5
"Worst app....After complaining issue with the order....no order is taken...Instead of taking any action, they simply close the chat😡...very poor service",1
Great service. Reached my place without asking for my location. Been using their services for some time now. Quite satisfied 😊,5
"It's was good initially , but now the promo cards doesn't work, even if it does, the delivery might come late, disappointed!",1
Food quality rating shall be rated atleat 1 hour after the food is delivered while the delivery shall be rated immediately. If you make these options separate insted of rating the food at the time of delivery,5
"What a nice app for ordering online food being at home. All the function of this app is good. The delivery is at time. Absolutely, it is nice app",5
The App isn't opening. I am a Pro member as well. I keep on getting msg on home screen that something went wrong and I am not able to do anything on the App.,1
Very bad experience example my order expected but restaurant not open very big mistake so I am very angary.30 Apr 2021 live tracking order wrong time see in app so bad experience I am sharing my friends.so bad service in Zomato,2
Saty away from Zomato!! In the space of 3 days I have had the same issue 2 times where the driver is assigned to my order but no one turns up to collect the order and deliver it. When I get through to customer service they just keep apologising and taking a long time to assign a driver. By the time it's all sorted food arrives late and it's honestly really cold. Same issue 2 times in the space of 3 days is unacceptable. I will be using deliveroo or another alternative and advice you to as well.,1
"Easy to find what you desire to eat, rating and even reviews on restaurants you'd like to visit. Very user friendly!",5
"Orders (foods) arrived after two hours of waiting(got starved), because assigned driver from Zomato was changed then picked up the order from the restaurant, super late. First time using Zomato app and I've got this kind of situation. Disappointing.",1
"Pathetic service, not just once but continously everytime got disappointed with the Zomato service. I made a mistake by opting for a PRO member, its a waste of money.. Zomato - a poor delivery service for food..",1
"It's a very good app , and I love it . There's no need to even go out and they follow all Corona rules as well as we can also instruct them from a call.🤩🥘",4
Worst delivery experience I am having with company. Valet has picked up order at 8:57 but still he has not delivered the order and from last 40 mins valet is just travelling from one place to another and saying that he has to pick one more order also.... Worst service from zomato....,1
"App services are very good in this covid situation also,but they need to improve the number of valets because orders are tkaing long time other wise assign near valet to deliver the order as fast as possible",5
"Amazing app. The quality of delivery is also great, order is delivered within the time mentioned.",5
Not working since 10 days. Unable to detect my apartment location but my neighbours are not having any issue. Can't seem to understand the problem.,1
"The staff is quite diligent and sincere ! The decor was lovable , the crowd was very civilised , and most importantly the menu was noteworthy and well elaborated:)",4
"Very poor app,i placed an order and after few minutes they cancelled my order and showing on my portal that i will get my money back till 1 May while my money has deducted on 24 April 2021 around 1 pm .very disappointed",1
"Great customer care, good delivery time. But the only catch is that sometimes charge more than the restaurant.",4
Very bad experience. It always say due to high demand you cannot order less then the amount they show you. Worst experience I am going for swiggy.,1
"“The Food is Excellent.” The food is excellent, generous portions and great prices. The service was fast and friendly. I highly recommended it if you’re in the Wellfleet area.",5
It was good..before months... But now.. Zomato is not same.. whats they were in past.. I am totally confused disappointed... With the restaurants.. And services which they are paid for...they are worst.. Service is no a days..,1
"I placed an order that didn't apply the discounted rate, called and contacted tye support team and explained my situation they said they will refund the order, Made the same order again From the same restaurant and I apply the discounted code and it was successful the customer service called me again and said she cannot refined my 1st order because it is being delivered And now on zomato both order shows that they were delivered when only the last one with the applied discount Code was delivere",1
Too much delivery charge. Food gets cold by the time it is delivered. Zomato takes a lot of time to confirm the order.,1
"I am editing my previous review, it has now tracking but in lieu of it zomato inflates the rates of the dishes add delivery charges and then give small discounts so that users feel happy.",2
"Absolutely pathetic service. Half the order delivered, prepaid the full amount. Rider has his phone switched off. Customer care says these issues happen so not a big deal. Swiggy much better than this!",1
Well..i shifted to zomato after updating my phone and yet again..the entire discount thing is finicky and also the restaurants have a different standard from what v eat wen v order..alas..zomato cannot deliver the taste..,4
Worthless customer service! I'm not able to use Zomato credits at checkout and they say its impossible! I have even tried to reach out by mail. No response from many days! Pathetic! Please don't cheat customers!,1
I don't Understand Why U Ppl Are Hiking Prices of food From good Restaurants !!! And From that Your Adding Extra Charges also which is too high Please try to Reduce it.. it's very Bad that You Guys are doing .. do it But Do in Some Reasonable Way U can Not Like This,3
"Very worst! actually we have ordered 2 no. Items, but they have delivered only 1 item. So we have contacted the delivery person and he said that it's not my fault, it is the restaurant's fault. He also said that what will I do with your dish. When we tried reaching the restaurant nobody answered the call . Very bad service .",1
please improve delivery boys behaviour and sometimes delivery boys reached very very late but delivery boys saying like this we have malti orders what I do. my food important to us. multi order processing very very worst. is delete multiple orders option,1
Not even a single restaurant is accepting is available to me. But it is available in my frnds mobile who lives beside my house. I donno what the hell's happening. Such a worst app,1
"Some restaurants are available for delivery in my location, but it is not showing in the dashboard unless I am searching for the restaurant separately. Don't know what is the issue.",5
"Zomato is an excellent app that provides information on all kinds of cuisine suiting all pockets. By being Zomato Pro member, I get great discounts on orders made to selective restaurants that provide quality food.",5
One of the worst experience with Zomato . Having tie up with un hygienic hotels and given good ratings . I have received today a decomposed vada from the hotel Devi's food court. Reason behind getting from that hotel is Zomato given good ratings. Raised a complaints with food safety dept just now,1
Don't see why a food delivery app needs my email. Haven't been able to use it . Good luck getting customers this way.,1
Better than before. Love the app functionality and features. Good customer support as well than before. I'have become pro member too as I like their services.,5
What a horrible app. They don't even have customer support. For any query the max one can do is talk to chatbot and get extremely irritated. Ur app and ur service sucks.,1
I am very disappointed with their service... I have ordered my food and till 35 mins after ordering food they can't find any valet for my order .. poor service!!,1
"Recently subscribed for pro membership , and received the order way over from the said delivery time. Simply scamming people and charging extra money them for services which they clearly are not capable of providing . Hence giving such a review after so many years of being a customer",1
Poor chat support. Agents deny escalations and keep us waiting for more than 45 mins for an escalation. Agents use templates and while replying and sounds robotic.,1
"The worst customer support, need to update the list of restaurants which are operational only, why have restaurants that are closed down with 75% missing items in the menu.",2
Zomato has the best customer care services and they actually take care of their users. I have been a very old zomato user but never faced any issues with food or even delivery but recently I encountered both the issues well it wasn't the issue from zomato's end but yet considerately they helped me. I haven't seen such quick service when you have issues. I really wish zomato all the very best and hope to be your valuable user. Thank you!,5
"They Never delivered on time always late more than 20 minutes delay even customer care was not so support, they say we need to adjust.",1
Delivery charges are alot more. Better try and order directly from the restaurant and save time and money,1
In this pandemic I am thankful to the whole team for your service to man kind but ofcourse it would be more helpful if you could take care of the glitches so that the customer experience is more smooth.,5
little cozy corner in hassan to hangout with friends. Food is great. All varieties of momos are amazing. butter pepper prawns and triple Schezwan noodles were delicious. ambience is lovely and artistic. staff is super friendly and courteous. loved the place overall. highly recommended,5
"I am not being able to read any reviews of any restaurant no matter how many times i install and reinstall the app. This has never happened before, is it a glitch?",4
"Very bad experience , no option if delivery boy decline to deliver the order.. chat is only option which is also auto generated response",1
What the hell is zomato pro I thought it would reduce the delivery charges and would deliver orders quickly but as I am experiencing that after taking pro delivery time is not at all reduced its the same then why the hell did I pay 200 for pro not at all worth it don't take pro version guys it's useless utter nonsense waste of money,1
"Zomato as delivery partner Very bad and poor service .i had continous 3 delivery issue some had missing ,taste and today i had faced leaked and spoiled food due to the mistake of delivery person .after that they are not responsive in helping chats it takes 48 hour for a reply .",1
"Worst service,charges extra money,directly go restaurant check prices of any item ,nd check same item prices in zomato charge will be more, simply they increase prices nd they give discounts.",1
It is the worst app for ordering the food. They didn't even have the facilities to connect the costumer with customer care. And they provide the worst food.,1
Still Need the accurate map update while delivery partner in travel. I give the 4* rating for the present versions order tracking interface.It looks good.,4
Nice app.. All deliveries are well on time. Rates are comparatively better than other apps!! Happy to use it.,5
Very poor service and stale and expired food being supplied with no proper check. Please be careful to order on Zomato as they are not taking necessary precautions for delivering healthy and safe food.,1
"Can be better discount to increase orders....will enhance ur business...like whatever will be delivered(like anything)grocery,food...etc from one place to another....so it will increase ur business...",5
I wish i could rate it in negative stars The worst app food are always delivered late i have faced this problem for 4 to 5 times food was late for more than 2 hours i wouldn't recommend it to anyone instead i will make sure that everyone should be aware of this pathetic behavior of zomato the reason swiggy is much more better than zomato,1
It is a good app for food.I like this app. When We busy and our mind says eat some healthy and tasty food . So this app is good for food,5
Terrible experience. Delayed response by chat employee led to order being delivered at wrong address. Refusal to even acknowledge their fault reeks of a stubbornness uncommon in this field. Not ordering again.,1
"Worst experience in ordering food from Zomato. Initially showing 55 minutes arrival time. After 55 minutes, again 25 minutes time....I don't understand how system works in Zomato. Don't ever try this Zomato...",1
"Confusing and not so userfriendly. Added 2 items in the cart but not sure how, the order was placed only for 1. Got to know after receiving the order.",2
"Very bad services, specifically the customer service they are the worst, I order food for 15 persons they send me only Pepsi after 2 hours without the food and after a lot of time discussing with them they said we can't refund your money because we deliver the Pepsi and the didn't approve to send some one to take it back",1
"Who is supposed to provide me the ticket number?? Still waiting As requested dropped a note at the email is provided. Waiting to hear for the solution Could have given ZERO if possible because if the customer support. I had terrible experience recently, instead of helping the customer, they started sharing the standard drafted messages and was taking sooo much to respond. The support chat is getting bad to WORST... They're should be some way to escalate, this will help the customer.",1
"It has a nice interface. I often choose it over swiggy for searching and delivery, because swiggy has a bad interface and this has a much better interface.",4
In ordered from zomato an hour ago. It showed me order is ready and delivery boy has picked your order. But after an hour I called a delivery boy and he said I m going to pick your order.. This made me disappointment with zomato app.,1
"They do fraud through their delivery persons. First they place the order and then play cards on the basis of distance and corona situtation by asking extra delivery charge or else cancel the order...and without any further confirmation from higher authority they will cancel your order and charge the full money including food charge, tax and delivery charge. I paid 590/- INR for the food and charged the full money because i cancelled the order for not paying 50/- INR extra. I hate this app.",1
"This app is having the worst support group. After not delivering my breakfast and lunch order, they were offering me the item price refund without having a decency to enquire what I wanted.",1
"Zhantu after sales services. Not able to make complaint via chat platform. Updated, restarted, cleared data but still not able to initiate chat.",1
Zomato is the worst service provider in Kolkata. Today I ordered lunch around 12 pm and as per the app food was to be delivered in 45 minutes. After an hour passed and there was no sign of the delivery. So I called the delivery guy and he very casually said that he is not going to deliver as the drop point is not near to his suitability. The help desk was useless as usual. It's a service provider with lots of false promise and inefficient to the core. THINK TWICE BEFORE PLACING YOUR NEXT ORDER.,1
"Need to improve app. Because order tracking is not working properly,sometimes order tracking is slow.So need to improve this feature.",4
Very poor service. Fix the bugs. Every time I open the App its started buffering even have a good net connectivity.,1
"they claim no responsibility for the restaurant or the food quality. Zomato is only as good as the restaurants near you or how the delivery guy is feeling that day. the delivery guy will stand just under your apartment, eat your food, say it was spoiled, go back to the restaurant, again get a new delivery and take twice the time, and of course Zomato will do nothing. its better to get to know newrby good restaurants and ask them for home delivery, because Zomato doesn't care.",1
Food from Zomato suddenly is now expensive. I am ok with food price. I am ok with delivery charge. But not ok with your so called minimum order of 375 criteria.....no one forces customers to buy certain amount of food...i choose Zomato over swiggy always but now i m uninstalling this app...,1
"App doesn't let you specify the delivery addr for the order, instead it shows a maps pin based on the phone location - this forces delivery person to call for directions and address.",2
Customer Care chat option is sub standard. Let customers know if you have an person / bot in conversation. App restarts / crashes while taking snaps of the food packaging,2
"App is not functioning . Not able to order anything. Have just bought Pro and this is the end result, what kind of a joke is this. I spend 200rs and zomato stops working. Great going.",1
Hard to describe your problem. When order is late from the restaurant side or zomato side the commuterized messages doesnt mention anything realistic. Sad.,2
"Easy to operate, covers all nearby restaurants, on time delivery and live updates.. Reasonable pricing to be appreciated.. keep it going Zomato",5
"Hopeless service, they can spoil mood of any celebration. I ordered a cake with a instructions on the cake but later I came to know the instruction was not even given to the bakery shop. Dear zomato partner if u can't serve your customer properly than please stop your service.",1
"They have a pathetic customer service department, if it actually exists. Even after being a pro member didn't get any help at all in resolving the issue with an order. Was made to wait for a very long time without any response from their side but were told to bear with them. My question is why? If you don't have enough manpower to support the customer service why give an option? Just let us know we'll have to deal with it ourselves. Very disappointed..😞",1
"The app is very unreliable. The cost of foods when ordering in app is hiked by restaurants, so prices are higher, and most of the time you still pay about Rs 50 more, despite discounts. Then there are shady demands for 'minimum cost for order', without any transprancy why. Worst is when you place an order sometimes restaurants do not accept or reject it for almost 30 mins or more. You can't even order elsewhere, cause no cancellation option..overall app is sometimes helpful, but too unreliable..",1
"My all orders till date were near perfect. Discounts, quick delivery with number of food spaces. Keep the good work going!",5
"They add so many extra taxes and delivery charges, and on that give only rs 50-100 off, it is better to go and eat then order from zomato, food is always cold, and cold drink is always hot, full waste of money",1
Way better when it started now its prices are to much. Almost no promo codes. No discount.,3
"Poor app, says restaurant is offline & doesn't accept orders most of times. Also, very poor-quality food & service provided by restaurants.",1
Very helpful app for immediate food ordered.service is very good and quick That's why we are enjoying warm food for eating Thank you zomato,5
It's a very good online food delivery app wd good offers and the staff the delivery people are also very nice n well behaved.,5
Exceptional good last two days I'm facing some issues like late delivery and food not upto Zomato standards. The moment I told them about this. The took corrective action and intiated the refund. Customer service 👍✨💕.,5
The app is good but sometimes cash on delivery is not available and once it happen that my money has deducted but order has not placed And it happen with my frnd also so little scared to pay online payment,3
Amazing app i am living far from my home this app helps me to order my favourite food whenever i want without going out and having lot of offers and getting more food in less price ordering thali that taste like my own home food great work zomato keep it up!❤️,5
Didnt liked the service as after 1 hour also i didnt receoved my oreder ... Also the contact no of the restaurant is not in service... Cannot track my order,1
Good when i order all times it ce in time after some orders it took among. 45. To 50 min and anly. 250. Below. COD. They should change that amount,3
"Worse and getting more worse day by day, I m adding more if I could minus marking I could give that as it's the worst company I ever saw, being a gold member customer service is just good but company is worst for customer, their policy never allow the customer service to work for customer service, their policy only provides that CCE to apologize nothing else, do not order from here I already took all my frndz and family member away from zomato including 20 normal and 6 gold members",1
"Two three times payment fail, and in hurrying we missed discount. I think this is the policy.",2
please add option to filter only Non-Veg food. why to put filters only fpr veg or egg? -- also GPS does not work -- please fix this!,1
First orders have delivery charge free and once the order is cancelled from the other side the next order levied the delivery charges even though technically it is the first order.,1
"Very bad experience , food not delivered still showing delivered,and no one is responding in chat from last 1 hour . really upset with the services from last 2 times",1
"Improved quality and service, more options, all expected food items with cocern Restaurant or Hotels. Multiple offers, speedy delivery.",5
Its shameful to see such negative comments for such a good app. I found it super easy to use. We need to take into consideration that zomato is a thrid party application which basicly gets customer to restaurant and cant be responsible for bad service of the food because its the restaurant's not zomato. Service was great.,5
It was too good form zomato it is a quick app for online payment just u have to enter ur mobile no. and then the OTP arrives and it is just done in one minute,5
They won't give responses quickly. They test customers patience. It is a waste app. I have got many bad orders through this app. I have to take action on this app. Customer care service is waste,1
It is so cool I like this app very much because when we compared to other app it is so low cost and easy to use and delivery is so fast thank you to Zomato 😄😄,5
"Its such an nice app, it gives you discount but sad that the discount is only for credit card,it has most of the restaurants their and gives you discount as I said",5
"Good fast delivery. More detailed description of food should be added, major ingredients, spicy level (4-5 levels from very spicy - mild)",5
ig give an option of giving someone else's number along side a saved adress so when you order for other people the valet calls them directly for directions.,5
"Much better than swiggy! Prices are better, more restaurants to choose from, and just love the app.",5
We ordered food from biryani by kilo thru zomato..but no tracking system..no contact personell... they give you number which suppose to b a hotel number but instead you get call centre number which situated miles away from your place..I ordered food from briyani by kilo and call centre situated in gurgaon..on d top of that call centre people are least bother abt issue...guy name inder who is manager of call centre most irritating guy..I uninstalled zomato...very bad experienced..,1
The delivery was pretty quick and the food was warm when it came so kuddos for that. Looking forward to order more through this app.,5
"Support system is very very bad. I have an issue with my order , I tried to solve my problem but my problem isn't solved yet. I chat with Zomato but no one reply my messages.",1
Very nice service. Totally happy with the service speed and reach of the app throughout the country,5
"Very bad.Install and order at your risk.Ordered today and paid online advanced but order was not delivered and now after chatting with them,i was told refund initiated and it will show in 2-5 days.",1
Repeated delayed deliveries. Their service is as pathetic as ever. They don't hire enough delivery drivers and your order is always clubbed with atleast one another. So you never get your food in the promised window. It's not the driver's fault. The company is cheating their customers as well as their employees.,1
Hey I am very very satisfied with Zomato. It gives you so many good offers on food and It is also provide nice service to their customers. I am very satisfied. Thank You Zomato.,5
Excellent Service with versatile options ... It should have an option to use roaming number for messaging option and should have calling option like uber.,4
The map live tracking is not accurate at times and sometimes the delivery persnl doesn't pick the phone . Plz fix the issue of live tracking and communication,2
It's a very Nice app to order food online.👍 Hopefully we'll have tasty experience in future also. Good luck..!!👍👍,5
Worst delivery timings. Just 1.5 km distance from to restaurant but zomato valet will takes time for delivery more than 50mnts. Great job by zomato🙏🙏.,1
"Poor services, arrogant behaviour of CCE, always delaying delivery by 30 mins then expected time, inappropriate usage of wordings, rather than improving try closing matter by giving promo codes. Swiggy is far better, Zomato sucks.",1
Worst app. It shows wrong location which is used for delivery. Many times order will get cancelled on last movement. Don't use Zomato.,1
The delivery persons of zomato are the best. There service nd talking to customer nd there behavior is very nice. 5 star for this app is coz of delivery persons.,5
"There is an issue for payments via Gpay and sometimes the location is not accurately shown, otherwise, good app.",3
"It was good in starting, now they are just making fool of customers. They deducted the money and the order was not received.",1
"Worest delivery service, almost 1.30mins ovver but still order is not yet delivered and customer care guy telling it will take 1 more hour. I never see such a worest service and customer support.",1
Chat support is very poor. Distance fee shows Rs.20 but while making payment it will be Rs.40 which is very high. Remove distance fee charges.,2
"Had very bad experience recently. They just cancelled my order after 3 hours, and this is 3rd time they're doing this. And I have order from reputed restaurants. This is very pathetic. Uninstalled this app. 🖕🏻",1
zomato offers are often misleading and enticing. however it's a good app for scouting new places and seeing their menu and prices.,4
Need to optimize maps for delivery person. They keep roaming or tend to take the long route.,3
Of course a good and easy app. But please reduce the menu prices. It's killing us as a customer.,4
Customer service is poor as it gets. It is like a dumb machine only responding as told. No interaction or no effort in knowing the issue/query of the customer.,1
They have dominos added but they can't do anything. Even if dominos delivers food in 2 hours. Response is always wait you will get your food.,1
"The food was not satisfied 😕 The payasam was not good....the milk used in it was bad and some dishes were missing in the meal.( aviyal ,pappadam,rasm,paripu,pachamooru). The fish fry was also less ,motham podiyayirun..The thoran was very pity.the quantity of achaar was very less. Kh ennu kettapo etreke ollu ennu pretheeshichilla, valare moshamayi poi ..njagal agrahichu vagiyatha ..kittiyath egane ayi poi ....🙃",1
Fast service. Really get order in 20 minutes. Awesome service.,5
Fast delivery best portion of food on every order. I felt satisfactory with spending money after receiving each order in comparison to other food apps,4
refund service are too much poor ....if I pay instant so I should refund instant also but it will be take time 7 to 10 days don't know why 8 days already completed but I did not receive my money,1
I've been constantly using Zomato for years now and from last a month or so i face issue with my every order ...the delivery is often not done in the time promised.,2
"Whenever I want to order it says to add another item because demand is high.. I don't like this,please fix this!",1
"Wide selection of cuisine / restaurants easy to order , offers should be automatically applied when eligible",5
"They lets us know even teeny-weeny details ! Like , who's the valet , about him , exactrice etc. Anyway , super-sick app !!! Loved it !!!",5
App is slow these days. From opening to choosing the food and until following the delivery. Please fix.,4
Very much disappointed by taking pro membership...dont even willing to give 1 star after my membershp exp....limitted options of restaurants with very costly food...no offer just show off... without membership its much better...plz dont waste ur money on membership its just scam by zomato...,1
Order got canceled at the time near to delivery time. Could not order anything else as lockdown time started by that time. Not expected this.,1
"I had to wait for 2 hours with no food. If you have issues with valet then you have to provide service to the customer first and then sort out things with valet. Why keep me hungry and not even deliver the food that I ordered and just offer a refund and tell me that I can order something else with that money. Man that's my money that you refund and I can buy anything else with it. At least don't give lectures like ""refund"" with no food after 2 hours of wait is a big problem solving. Pathetic.",1
"Getting worst day by day, saying if you give additional amount of order than only order will get placed, why anyone place extra order. Seems to improve their terms like early",1
"Very organized and steady, in this pandemic, one of the best service. Delivery guys are always wear mask and keeps fair distance. Overall safe and joyful ❣️",5
"Im loving it, best thing that happened to me, can order from anywhere to anywhere at anytime, just amazing how it brought to our doorstep 😍😍😍",5
💎 zomato app itself is conveniently amazing except a little feedback to be even available in the wider range in lebanon areas.,5
"Worst delivery and even worst customer support!! They take hours to deliver from places half hour from home. And even after that deliver your food to someone else. After all this, when I asked customer care to reorder my food, they kept me in waiting until I feel like hanging up the chat. At the end of the day you can't rely on such apps for your dinner. Worst experience!",1
the updated app is better because uh can pay via credit/debit card after ordering ur food for me this thing is good because i keep changing my mind about payment methods overall i love ittt,5
"The app is very good but it is not giving enough promo codes, and the words are very congested to read",4
"This app has made ordering food easy. It is so userfriendly that we can order our food, book table anything can be done in some click",5
"Really zomato is becoming bad to worst app ever. Bloody Zomato chat support is the worst Support ever i have seen. Chat support is used to help the users but it is escaping, skipping help to the users",1
Thankyou team zomato.... Appreciate all the delievery team and also the Advertisment team who comes up with such innovative mails and message I cants stop myself from ordering Food. You guys rock... Small complaint I have is that m getting over charge in Delievery.,5
Not user friendly. Some times order went through on its own. And other time even after click order not going through.,2
Very bad 😔😔 not have many locations and more only the main cities are available not available in the towns or village not also in ranipet dst,1
"After the recent update, some food items are not visible in the menu although the restaurant says that that the item is available.",5
"Very bad , not able to order a single dish at all they always want us to buy for 350+ otherwise you cannot have anything at all Really bad and greedy this food service is getting day by day",1
very 3rd grade delivery service as well as customer service where it is presumed that customer's inconvenience can be settled by Rs 50 evan without improving service. I have faced this situation thrice but customer service has only stereo type reply... very disappointing....,1
"All the offers they provide is not usefull at all, even prices are already high compare to restaurant menu on top of it delivery charge.",1
"Whenever confused, Zomato solves all my problems. However, I am still facing problems in customizing some items.",4
It takes 1hr 45 min to deliver the order. Meanwhile when Zomato is taking more than 1hr to deliver any order they are not providing any option to cancel your order. Worst experience.,1
Shows order delivery as 25 minutes'or 30 minutes and get it delivered in 1hour and surprisingly app shows order delivered on time,2
Everything is okay. But that restaurant demand is not okay. They r telling due to high demand they will take extra charge. If everytime they will do like this then how we can order😡,3
Doesn't contact the delivery person before accepting the order and the amount is deducted from the account. The service is horrible.,1
Very convenient way to order food during lockdown. Would recommend friends and family to go with Zomato.,5
"What's to rate good about Zomato/Swiggy? You list restaurant's names and whenever I've tried a new restaurant I've always been disappointed. If an order is messed up(Gravy instead of Fry), or taste is not goood, both Zomato and restaurant raise their hands...they say 'Cant do anything, its already delivered'... Happened a lots of times....""it's gravy only no saar....adjust it this time..."" Win win for both supplier and middleman,for customer..KLPD! So, what's worth my money giving it to you??",1
The cost of an Item ordered is actually 280 but in the app it is mentioned as 320+delivery charges+ tip+ foundation charges etc. Its deception. Better go for swiggy,1
"If order is coming late then why dont have option for cancel the food? Worst contacts too of hotels. Time to uninstall the app, You loss 1 foodie customer.",1
"Zomato support is really terrible, takes long time to convince them that only partial order was delivered. This is despite being a loyal daily customer of Zomata in addition to Zomato Pro subscription.",1
Zomato use to be Great.I'm not sure if they switched owners but it has going down hill from food to service. This happened with me twice and now i ordered a chicken keema which was too much salty and not eatable and in picture food was different thn i selected the support option nd thn i realized thy don't give a damn i guess thy r working from home chatting and doing some other work too they said a sorry with bla bla copy paste and took 5-10 minutes for it.,1
"Fast delivery, good customer support, gives good discounts.",5
Something different is added to the actual price. The delivery charge is also high. But still everything is fine,3
Order is always late..it shows order is picked up but when you call the delivery guy he says that he is still waiting for the food... But they charge 47rs for 300 meter delivery,1
"I was using Swiggy but my friend advised to use Zomato. I am very happy with discount, delivery speed as well as variety of options.",5
Awesome job guys. Easy to find food whatever I want to eat. Ordering from many years & love it. 👍,5
Terrible support. There's no way we can connect with the support team through the app. The support bot is just useless.,1
Excellent app. Saves me a lot of money and offers wide variety of choices. Easy navigation and pro offers are very rewarding...,5
"The latest ui change are awesome. Three button delivery,dine-in and review making the app more easy to use.",5
"I have issue with my recent order,but the chat person didn't respond more than 20 min ,very pathetic service, I am super frustrated with bad food delivered and on top of it these ppl screwing things big time",1
Delivery Charges is very high.. Recommend direct call to restaurant for free home delivery.. Otherwise reached on time/packing very good,3
"The best app for food delivery yet ""add ₹6 for placing the order"" this is most annoying. Hence stop displaying that .",3
Food lovers dont use this app.. Thay take odar from 15 km long rastorant So they can deliver food in 25-30 minutes You can just imagine what happened to the food Thay can't suggest nearest branch & restaurant..,1
Selected restaurants with tasty food and hygiene maintained. Compelling discounts make you order more and repeatedly. Excellent service.👍👍👍👍,5
Best food delivery app. So easy and simple to use. And my favorite part about the app is the offers.,5
Using this app for 2 years now initially I had gd experience but recently I m not happy with the service... App has no control over resturant using their own valet ..,2
zomato chat support cant really help you . My order had fevicol instead of cheese . They can't even rectify it with restaurant . 0 stars for you zomato . swiggy is better .,1
Very beautiful service.Offers are real not fake like other apps.It helped me in lockdown to enjoy food!!👍👍👍,5
"Hi, I hope this message find you well. Please fix the rate of the menus irespective of your corporate business. Have a great day ahead.",1
Zomato' delivery is very fast but I don't know why they do not give me cash on delivery option. So I have to use my another account to order but in that account they don't give me discount,4
Today I have ordered two items from two restaurants both items were so bad that no body can eat . And when I asked for refund they said that refund would not be possible .so overall my money get waste. And those who are ordering from Zomato please uninstall the app because they are irresponsible. There are very bad and do not even maintain the hygiene and you may be covid positive by this medium . Take an initiative to stop ordering from Zomato.😡😡😡😡😡😡😡,1
"Lot of restrictions on the value of the order, payment method. Wasted lot of time due to this",1
"Last Order from my account,, delivery boy cancelled my order for far distance,after an order of half an hour,,its not checked properly.. now a days i order for food to Swiggy only.",1
Very nice app which gives you many options to choose food from and the service by Zomato valets are very good in their attitude and service.,5
A boon to customers more so in Covid times. Prompt delivery as per instructions. Excellent App,5
Zomato and delivery services like you have made simple food so expensive that it is becoming difficult to order . You guys don't charge for delivery only but take a 30-40 % margin on the actual menu rates,1
Almost every item's price is twice of what we can get that in. And the actual item is not at all similar to the image shown 😕,1
"Great UI - pleasing to eyes and easy to navigate, no ads, good collection of restaurants.",5
It is very good but try to reduce cost on food and also try to increase the food quantity,4
Very difficult to use. Can't find cart and bulk order is not possible. Please add cart menu.,1
I HATE this app only because first time I haven't get my complete order and I had a word with zomato help desk they are only saying please wait and about 1 hour I am just waited mf application and there services .,1
Most of the time they have problems in delivering. This time food has not been delivered at all and they are saying it is delivered!!,1
They are clubbing orders to make sure you food does not get delivered on time. Have had such experience from last few times now.,1
"Unable to access the app Automatically gets closed. Post install the app, iam unable to open the app.",3
Great food delivery experience after Uber eats.Distance fee should be reduced which is making the order costly.,5
I love your service zomato. I always get hungry at 3am or 4am and you always deliver. Thank you so much. Also pay your zomato delivery gyys well. They work hard at night.,5
"Its a complete waste as to how Zomato treats its customers, you have provided a promo code as refund seriously, you all have succeeded in looting people's money. Big congratulations to Zomato and team. For a refund you have given me a promo code just wow and in that i cannot use any other promo code plus I can't use all my money and the left over money is gone why because Zomato's policy says its a one time use promo code.",1
Amazing food app i don't know why do i like it more than swiggy and now more discounts amazing but it will be more good if u add discounts on cash on deliveries also,5
The deliveries are very late. The Zomato valets are not even aware that they have an order assigned to them. Thoroughly disgusted with their slow service.,1
I tried to connect to the delivery executive I called him 50 times he did not received any call after that he switched off his mobile and I was waiting for my order  On your app I did not received any information regarding cancellation of order  Really disappointed from your services even I had a conversation on zomato chat as well they are just making fool of customer and able to assist properly.  I haven't received the money yet  The order was prepaid Now for more assistance you can just,1
V poor experience from customer care ... Only thing they can do is apologize when... something goes wrong.... If giving and option for not sending cutlery is a no... Then doesn't that means... If we donot select that option we simply want the cutlery... But a Zomato online says... Restaurant doesn't provide cutlery then y Zomato is making it confusing... By giving another for that.. it's not reastaurant fault it's simply Zomato fault who failed to update the restaurant or what ever it was,1
"The boneless chicken biryani was cooked well. The quantity was generous as well. I found it very tasty. It wasnt too much spicy but had just the roght amount, i felt. Accompanying raita was good as well.",5
"Don't install this, rather go out and dine in. Or there are plenty of other apps which provide better services than zomato. They have worst services and moreover their support is every beyond worst.",1
Ordered from zomato after a long time. These guys ensured that I get the same experience which made me stay away from them. The order just got delayed and got it in 90 min. Last time again for few more months and then would test waters. Untill then bye zomato..,1
"If your merchant makes a mistake, it's Zomato's mistake too. Don't wash off hands. Us writing a review and etc., won't compensate a customer. 3rd Class customer support. Scammimg at it's best interest - Zomato!! Bravo Zomato. You have done it again. Keep it up.",1
Support system needs to be improved. The chat kept getting transferred to different agents.,2
It's good and easy to use but sometimes there r a few restaurants listed where the food is awful wastage of money.,3
Liked Zomato delivery system and new updates in the mobile app. We can easily identify good food in this Zomato app. Liked it...,4
Great app for hotels n all.. Picks great restaurants... Only point of concern is the restaurant charges more in zomato when compared to other food delivery apps,5
"In time delivery,very good service and foods are delicious. Price also affordable.",5
"Taking care of the delivery guy in bangalore case really restored my faith in Zomato. So glad to be your customer. Here take my 5 stars. 😊 As for the app, nice improvements. Can't complain.",5
Worst support on zomato. The support team will not fullfill their words and then you keep on following. You can't escalate ur problem if not resolved properly. I believe they just commit anything to close the chat and make you run and spend huge time and effort that u better stop asking for support. Their support is like machine. Giving you same unrelated reply.,1
I am not happy with this now because what ever problem arises i just hear only one thing from them this will not happen from next time but this next time never comes seriously if you are not able to solve the problem atleast don't give false statements.,2
Everything is fine except the service charge..due to extra 55 rs many one is opting other ways to get food .if it reduced to less than 30 ..it will be great,4
"The Zomato guys are the ones who won't provide the service properly, and won't allow cancellation. This is ridiculous. The order takes an hour to prepare and I can't even cancel. They say that since preparation has began, you will be charged for cancellation. This is bullying.",1
It's a vey nice app . This is the best ordering food online app ever i have seen. Everything is clearly mentioned . Thank you for this app o,5
Best thing is that I get a lot of discounts which is exactly I use it so often over other food delivery apps,5
The app is amazing with minute delivery Details. Just Order and on a click you are guided. Too Good.,5
"One of my food item was not delivered and I have choosen the promo coupon as an refund option, however the conditions attached to the promo coupon were not expressed before. Later when I came to know about the usage and expiry condition, I wanted to get the refund at my bank account but the request was not processed. Worst customer service",1
The app has become very poor as I can't apply any coupons. It shows the coupon in section but when I apply it shows coupon not applicable.,2
Well we frequently order from zomato. And the offers and delivery time is good. We didn't face any problems till now.,4
I just love this app because I'm at Dubai right now and this app really help me alot so many restaurants so many choices Delivery on time Hygienic Food and service i am Highly Recommended..,5
Today I first time use zomato app n get bad experience .. 40 minutes gone still waiting its showing 30 minutes more need even the restaurant 3Km away from my house..,1
Only 5 resturant is delivering to my current location if I am changing the location then also it's showing the same result. Worst service,1
Hi zomato I was happy to say I'm going to be your prime members list because I cross 200+ order from the date of using zomato right now I have completed my total order 234 order zomato always give me fast Delivery good and quality and customer support I was happy I recommend to all use this application 🥰😍😍😍thanksgiving🦃a good service,5
Horrible and terrible order delivered at 1 hour 15 mins time and valet doesn't know the location. Never expect a worst experience from this app hate it self,1
The PRO membership charges not useful at all. The pro facility will must be allowed atleast free delivery charges. Swiggy is far better than from zomato.,1
My 1st order but very good experience As I am at Malad East but mistakenly I order to Andheri West restaurant. But when I called to Mr Aseer Ahmed he was very polite and accepted the order. I appreciate his dedication towards work Brother keep it up.,5
"Till the time I had not taken a pro membership, I use to get offers of same and even offered off on delivery charges. Since I have paid the amount and taken a pro membership, I don't get any offers of pro membership nor offered off on delivery charges.",1
"Good app I order food using it, it's fresh and hot as like just made! And is good eatable quality",5
"Worst, this app and the company has no regards for customer. I order pizza from oven story those peeps were more of the crooks who didnt cancel the order after telling me on the call that they will because they cant arrange delivery. Zomato customer care is where i felt this company should be bared from operating if there isn't a single person to take up responsibility. I have been in contact with 3 executives (incapable idiots), to process my refund, but it seems they are new and dont know.",1
As per delivery it's good.. but pro subscription is limited to the restaurants we cannot add our favorite dishes for discounts,3
Now Zomato services are very poor very very poor quality food and packaging and the delivery boy also does not brings the food with care🤮🤢🤢🤢. It is best that you make packet noodles or go and bring something.,1
It's fantastic experience ordering food here. I always prefer zomato as it gives better service and some great discounts.,5
Delivers on time and good discount. The delivery person also very polite and makes minimum calls.. I like zomato's service.,5
This wonderful app that we can order food easily and the delivery is very fast and anyone can use this app thanks to Zomato for creating this and fabulous app,5
"It's good,but it would have been better if delivery was more faster,and live location is not working I guess",4
Too much lag and the delevery service is too much poor. I prefer all that use swiggy it is mych better than zomato. Another issue is pricing zomato billed extra than swiggy . I personally recommend you guys swiggy. Bad app and bad expirienc I ever had.,1
"Now Zomato added compulsory tip for the delivery guy (which should be optional), even we don't know they will get or not..although if you will compare the price of the meal and make discount 50% still the price is more. It means touching left ear with right hand or left hand but in the end you are touching your ear only...Zomato is not giving anything from their pocket or giving very less to delivery guy..that is why many guys boycott zomato.",1
"Very bad delivery, food spilled all over.. And then when claimed did not even return my money to my account.. Gave a promo code instead.. Very bad service.",1
Zomato service is ok but they do frod with offers n coupons..many coupons results invalid or not applicable at order time..and they don't have customer care number yet..chat help service is bogus also.,2
"Zomato app not well designed, customer suffers with order not delivered for more than hour, app or customer support has only option to cancel order.",3
The delivery charge is increasing. Even to order ₹50 item including all charges it goes to hundred. Pathetic service by Zomato.,1
it used to be a life savour but nowadays every now and then items are either missing or wrong item is getting delivered. Disappointed with the service where restaurant and valet play blame game. 😔,2
Very convenient app for me and my family to order food from Zomato now I love the discount and reviews of the restaurant which helps me to order the right food,5
"Worst experience. When you guys deliver a wrong order after 1.5hrs of waiting then you owe the customer complete refund, not 30 minutes of debate and partial refund.",1
"Worst app, they donot have any resolution for your comlpains.. they don't even have any other option apart from chat and those chat persons will keep repeting the same things.",1
Multi orders being sent via a single agent however if 1st order is not delivered the agent cant move to next location. Thereby delaying the subsequent orders,2
Pathetic... They do not properly authenticate third party websites and vendors. After I ordered a pizza on Zomato and amount got debited and while I was waiting for my pizza I got a call from some unknown number asking me to pay 10 rupees using link they provide to get my pizza... I'm really surprised how Zomato can allow third party access to my data and how I could receive an unauthorised link from external party without knowledge of Zomato when I order in Zomato. Beware of Zomato app.,1
"the app is good. but the customer service is arrogant. unless you need the customer service help, all is well and depends on restaurant quality. Zomato as such has no work than connecting supplier with demand. Besides the donation amount is added to your bill and you won't realize. It cannot be reverted. Customer service can not do anything that you want. They cannot revert the incorrect deduction. They cannot call store. I mean when you need them they are useless and powerless and helpless.",1
Starbucks delivery time was excessively long. When we order in a Starbucks cafe they deliver in 5 min. On zomato it took them 40 min to handover a simple coffee and tea order. When I called them they said valet did not turn up.,1
My favorite place with great ambience and tasty food. The place is very neatly maintained. Must try for all foodies.,5
Good service by Zomato but owner of restaurant what they do is its delivery/parcel food so they sometimes send stale food.Bcz they no maximum thing the customer can do is review bcz nobody goes to the ordered restaurant to show and ask why this stale food is delivered to me.,4
"Worst service & no response from agents. Not delivering fresh one. Seems, delivering non saled food on online order.",1
Today placed order. It has not asked promo code on top of that credit card payment has happened without asking OTP. Consulted help desk but no resolution. It is violation of credit card payment rules,1
No cashback is coming after applying Promocode. Custom care is also not providing information just they are telling system issue is there System issue is there for 20 days,1
"Very late delivery, very less discounts, swiggy is far better than zomato in terms of discounts, delivery service etc.",1
"Presently the offer window tab is not displaying properly, and there is some problem with discount and offer uploading.",4
There should be no limit of order price I mean we should be given a option of ordering food with no limitations on cash on delivery also,4
Zomato chat doesn't work this is the second time. My order has been misplaced again. I've been sent non veg food. Thanks.,1
"Good service, excellent customer service ,good staff and delivery boys,overall good app to order ur food,on time and good discount",5
"After using zomato for almost 10 months I have now stopped using it. I have also cancelled my zomato gold membership. When I purchased zomato had the zomato pro membership which gave excellent offers. Zomato pro then changed to zomato gold midway and their prices kept increasing, but services kept deteriorating. Very sad to see.",3
Very bad customer support. Had issue with my order and i tried reaching them so many times. they reply with same Bot message everytime.,1
The app is very easy to use and follows all safety guidelines and delivery boy wears mask too.It shows the exact time of delivery.Its a very good app,5
At the beginning zomato charges the proper amount. Later it starts increasing the amount. And time runs very slow for zomata i guess... 5min of normal time = 1min in zomata..,2
"We cannot trust on this app specially when you are paying online cause food will not be delivered to your door step,,,,,,and now I'm editing review Zomato changing rules... like automatic cutting charrity n not give refund money giving promo code,,, Zomato don't care about customers only make Short business... giving online food habits n cheating with customers",1
Quality of food at restaurant should be checked before uploading on zomato. People are paying high price for normal price to get better quality of food.,3
"Speed Delivery, very nice offers, lot of choices of Food, easy to use and ordering food with more choices",4
Overall worst .each and every day they are increasing tax and charges amount for regular customers. Tax and charges which is included with item price. Tax and charges extra and delivery charges extra!!!!! Is this any kind of joke MF. Why should we pay double tax and charges for fooding? #OnlineScam #SmartRobbery #MoneySucker I'll launch complain about it... #remember,1
Really like all services here. All reviews helped me to choose good quality food. Nice app.,5
"I can save more from my favorite restaurant and they added an option for pick up now. But, rest assured I'll give some tip for riders in future order. Thank you Zomato!",5
"I have purchased one cake, found Cake quality and taste is very worst , still not revert for solution",1
Great experience past 2yrs using zomato they improved everything very well accurate location tracking minimal calling deliveries some offers everything was good happy to be part of zomato family 👪,5
Maps showing wrong route always. Delivery person comes to the back side and not able to come to proper location,2
Very good and fast delivery and also provides more offers than the others .This app is just a 😇 fablous app ever,5
Waste of service the service very slow I have cancelled the order immediately with in seconds after I ordered for that they have charged 75 rupees nd the balance amount still they have not transferred to me waste of service,1
I'm so disappointed with zomato valet...I have been customer of zomato for more than 5 years and this is the first time this has happened to me that the valet has not delivered the food and order got cancelled ...I had been waiting for my order for 1 hour and this is what service I get? I'm very disappointed with the service..not going to use this app again to order food now.,1
Over the time they have improved. The customer care is also much better. The valets are doing a great job even during the difficult times.,4
great. Love the cash on delivery feature especially because it allows you to order upto 750 Rupees.,5
"Useless, they give fake info online and their delivary agent flew away with the order, not ready to delivar the food as contactless though took money in advance. Hsve raised an escalation. Don't go with this pathetic app.",1
"Very Amazing app with very exclusive prices, here you can buy 20 rs prantha at 100rs (plus tax and delivery + packing charges) Keep it up...",1
Horrible customer support. They take long time to reply to queries and half their coupon codes don't work... Horrible experience.,1
Pani Puri On shop price 30/= .. Zomato Price= 45 Tikki/bhallpapri onshop price 60/= Zomato price =85/= + Delivery charges 54/= Final Zomato bill 466/= onshop bill 210/= now apply coupon and get 100/= discount.. and pay 366/= instead of 264/= including delivery. This is the way Zomato looting us 😀😀😀😀,1
"Some times working some times app was closed. Some times amount debited but order not placed, money also not refund any day that situation use this app worrest",3
Best app to order food online. The support chat is even verg good. most of restaurant are listed so wide variety of food.,5
App shows incorrect delivery time and it changes after payment is made. Happening quite frequently now.,2
No use of writing in website. This 1star rating is more enough to your site i will recommend 0star for this.they can't resolve any problems in time.,1
Very handy and convenient app to order food. The discounts and promos they offer are good.,5
It's a great app which provide all the details before booking but one time your company did not refunded my money,5
Was good before the new update as they have started adding extra orders for the valets in between delivery route which is killing the foods taste and I am not getting hot food served,1
"Prices shown on Zomato are way higher than the prices at resturant, along with this Zomato put tax on the orders (no tax at resturant) along with delivery charges. Even after that they ask us to donate to delivery man and donate to a NGO",1
"Late delivery, Delivery & Charges are above 50%. They additionally charge 30-50rps, if you order below specific amount of the bill.",1
Experience with Zomato is not good .....In case of late deliveries or bad food quality what they do is provide Rs 50 coupon for further order ... Lot of arrogancy is shared from there side Green while raising the issue .....if in our country we can get justice quickly then I may have raised an issue against such scenarios,1
Food prices quoted in app is too high than the actual take away cost ...soemtime refund are not crediting back when correct food is not delivered,3
Few days ago this app was really helpful. But nowdays its showing Something went wrong. Not only in my device.,1
I am getting worst experience Today Given order around at @7.30PM.when unable to deliver the order tell the coustomers with in a half an hour.you people are prolonged almost 2hrs.Your giving refund its not an issue..But they are waiting for FOOD..,1
Delivery charge is high so many people divert to self purchase and your price and restaurant price are different. so guys go self to restaurant and take parcel,4
Help screen does not load at all. Orders gone wrong and no one to register a complaint to.,1
I thought online food delivery but it's very nice experience with Zomato and the price of foods that lower than offline we also get offers on online payment,5
Very poor customer service.. made to wait for 2 hrs after ordering and cancalled saying delivery person not available . Very diassapointed.. try avoiding this apps,1
If there is big demand for food at any restuarant then stop taking orders for the same for sometime instead of asking for surcharge. Disappointed,1
Today I made my first online food order through Zomato. Had extremely satisfied experience. Live update are very useful. Thank you....,5
"I like to order delivery from zomTo it is quick, safe ,easy to order and app is good for user i love the app thanks.....keep updating team ..thnks",5
"I feel the delivery charges and taxes are high.delivery is also late and I faced many issues related to cashback,wrong order and Kate delivery.please look into this",3
Rates are damn high compared to the rates of the restaurant. And delivery charges are also high even for a short distance for pro members😑😑. Not at satisfied with Zomato Pro. Really worse,1
Very nice app. The order was delivered on the time and the food was amazing. Thank you Zomato,5
love it just add new food hubs near our location everything's perfect food at your door steps instantly just need to improve your application a bit.,5
Good servise of delivery boy . But the test of the food is not that much good In the pic of food is something another and they send me some another dish but that dish was good but the purota not good they wheir wheir so hard and not hot and the test was not good. I request the hotel managment that they should improve their taste.,5
I love zomato for the sheer ease of placing the order and the courteous behavior of its associates. Zomato has also earned my admiration for truly understanding the idea of a multicultural society.,5
Nice app for home delivery of food.. delivery charges are high although.. fast delivery service.,5
"Location was not properly showing and compared to straight hotel its little bit costly in online ordering nowadays, im telling about that you are more indirect charges...i dont think hereafter, im going to use zomato.",1
You need to wait 2 hours if you have applied a code and mistakenly clicked on wrong payment gateway. the restaurant was closed in this drama of Zomato.,1
Delicious food. fast in service no difficulty in ordering. Polite attitude of delivery man. Only one thing I want to point out that glouves should be must in the hands of the delevery boy.,5
"Horrible Service, Incompetent System. Have had multiple such experiences with them - today being the worst. Ordered coffees from Starbucks, got coffees that were not sealed, straws that were not sealed, sugar sachets not shared, cream not added - was made to facilitate with Zomato's customer support, rider & Starbucks, made at least 11 calls in all, to get no coffee reordered. They offered me a measly refund after wasting 3 hours, and making me feel guilty for politely raising the issue.",1
They offer us to order as a gift it's a good option but when we do it. Until the order get delivered it's show as a gift but once done it's not showing as a gift and if we speak to there representative they say you have not clicked only that option and it's not first this happened with me 2 times. I thought maybe restaurant mistake but when I called them they say it's a Zomato mistake and Zomato ask me to ask restaurant they play like this does it really suitable for Zomato to be such a liar.👎,1
Very bad service. ORDER placed n waited for 1 hour .shown as delivered in live tracking but the in actual no delivery was there,1
Worst service ever. I waited for more than an hour but didn't receive my order Later I came to know that the delivery person had an accident so he couldn't reach on time..,1
Food charges is verry high comparing with same resturant .ismail resturant full biriyani cost 300 in zomato .In resturant it is 250 only .even comparing with swiigy 40 /- high .in swiggy it is 260 only . Cheating people,1
I did my online payment for my orderand my order not delivered and showing the msg that delivered before 19 mins earlier But the fact is my order is not at my location or else did not any call from the delivery boy And there is no fee response from that chat Mr.darshan not responding to the chat And gave a simple answer rider not responding and we will not repeat this again then wat about my payment Zomato,1
The pro membership is just awesome. U really save a hell lot of money. Thnk u for making my fooding experience so better.,5
It was easy to find food that too from hotel of my choice. Delivery was also satisfying.😍,5
Very good app with good features... U need to improve search feature for cuisine items ... Happy to use while in quarantine,4
Really very bad experience. i order food from zomato and i found some steel things in food which goes to my baby mouth how rediculous are they just give 1% for hygene also think that your food is being feeded by everyone dont just play with anybody's health,1
Most fraudulent setup. Conniving with restaurants to provide sub standard stuff to customers. Will go down soon.,1
- Inaccurate ETA on the app - Restaurant partner didn't responded - I don't need any promos or freebies🙏 - would've been better if I'd cooked food at home,1
"I am new user. Its been a month I am using Zomato's service. Ordered different foods at several times, and each experience was great. I am very happy with Zomato's service.",5
"This App is good and easy to order your foods, but people's who always hungry this app it helps them too.",1
Absolute rubbish customer support. I rated the application one on five and its quality is still the same 2 years later.,1
Great initiative and owesome work A little costly but gud services only if you know the good restorents from where you are ordering food,5
Didnot had great experience Ordered three pizzas and received two But have to pay the complete amount and customer support said i should with care It was completely my mistake and system is correct,1
Zomato experience for me is better than swiggy . I found whatever food order is properly delivered and very professional approach than swiggy,5
I am highly disappointed with the service of zomato. I had ordered my food sharp @8:30. And it was notified that I will recieve it within 29min. It is 9:45 now and still my food has not arrived. I am in contact with the customer service executive from past 40 min and I am getting just one reply. I sincerely apologise for the inconvenience caused to you . Would not atall recommend you order from zomato. You can take a risk and order if u wnt to have it the next day. Still not sure abt delivery.,1
My first order I loved it very fast delivery in the polling day near by mid night there is only few restaurants are open thank you zomato,5
Used to rate them 5 star. No more. No way in getting in touch with customer support besides automated messages. 😡,1
There is no distence barrier on inside the city so we can make hassle free orders. I am enjoying it.,4
Earlier Zomato was good but now they just Increase the price than show it as savings or discounts which I feel is like cheating customers!,1
"Had ordered a few eggless things from bakery. To my surprise , they were with egg. While taking a bite could maje out. No solution was provided, inspite of requesting many times to refund the amount.",1
"Tough times and all... Oh we get it... Delays in order are completely acceptable as long as it's not too much.... But what Zomato is doing is worse... Resetting the timer everytime order is late... That's cheating... Timer slows downs, resets itself... That's just trying to fool their customers... CHEATING!!!",1
The best and easy user friendly app among all available in the market Please keep the User Interface simple as it is specially after the new update,5
Don't believe Zomato once you start transaction. Without your permission they will automatically money debited from your sb account its happan to me on April 05/2021 after that I complaint against this issue but no use they will only asking time like 24.48.72 hours,1
I have ordered for MYSORE PAK instead of that after making the payment Order detail says milk cake is getting ready...And after heading for the cancellation 75rs has been chaged..Right away I am uninstalling this ..And for future course priority will be ur competitor SWIGGY..And moreover I will also make shure all the known collegaues and family members would uninstall ur app too...Dissatisfied customer,1
The application discriminate customers without any rational basis. The prices of food items shown on the application is different from customer to customer in the same location. When I confronted customer care executives they responded that it is beyond their control.,1
The rates are much higher than the actual rate and then on it they add the tax and deliver charge over and above the exaggerated rates. No USP. As similar as uber eats or swiggy.,3
The app is so good and delivered food is also good so my experience is best with zamato .. and i will keep ordering the food from zamato.,5
"Delivery is very slow, and the schedule given at first is constantly changed and delayed. Rest is fine.",3
"Packaging and quality of the food is very bad ,no as I had try to chat with the zomato chat . No help provided,waste of money and time tooo",1
I like this app better than any other apps. Easy to order and track. Lots of offers too,5
It service is awesome and at this time is very helpful for people to stay home,5
"Very good app. Clean and sanitized, fast delivery. Thank you team Zomato.🙏🙏😄😄",5
Too bad customer support experience first they are taking too much time and then there is now quick response from customer supper like they are ignoring,1
Forcefully adds credit or debit card details while placing an order instead of giving that option to users so no one should use the application.,1
Serve when u hungry at any time.....love it ....change the point of view of getting food at doorstep on one call... revolution in food industry,5
"Delivery time is great,and many restaurants deliver to my address only via Zomato. Happy customer here!",4
Service from restaurant/hotel is very bad and delivery time takes double what they show in the app.,1
Enjoyed the service till now. App is very good in finding the list appropriate restraunts surrounding my place,5
Service is very bad. I order two items on Zomato they delivered one item. They not provide refund amount. They will provide promo code. Third class service,1
"Covers old goa area quite significantly, so saves cost of travel to restaurants. also many discounts are provided",5
Worst experience They dont have connect to agent option !! Which swiggy has .. Very very worst app Wastage of money Even I mailed to customer support Still no reply received,1
A peaceful place to sit and enjoy the delicious food! Service is also good and quick :),5
Delayed customer service & no compensation for delayed food . I had to wait more than 90minutes for my food .,1
"Team, You need to work on your real time order updates. Your timer does not show accurate information regarding the delivery. I have observed it a few times. Despite, time passing by, your timer still shows the same estimated time of arrival. For e.g, if your order arrival time is 9 mins,your tracker still shows the same even after 10 minutes. (Your valet is already at the restaurant). I can share screnshots of the same . Do rectify this glitch. Regards,",3
"Happy to have Zomato for all kind of human beings low to high and vice versa. Amazing offers, in any case of issue it have problem resolving service team.",5
Absolutely irresponsible and uncaring customer service. the feedback holds even to this day. They remain as uncaring as they've always been.,1
Very bad service... I was orden and they dring at my home after 2 hour... And my home is just 2 km from they are shop... Very bad experience,1
"useless nd too expensive , quality is too low and very limited options. it is waste of money and taste. Delivery also too late.infact they take the order and do not deliver it Ata all",1
on time delivery very nice and supportive app I like it . It is also keeping covid safety and also giving nice offers,5
Best food delivery appp ever found...I love u Zomato for the Best offers and also for the best safety delivery in this pandemic...,4
Received order after two hours when the app was showing 35 minutes Eventually my children went to sleep having fruits disgusting service planning to throw every thing.,1
valets or delivery assistants are really nice. they are never frustrated finding roads. but restaurants to prefer where u visited,4
"Pathetic. After 1 hour also no update about my delivery and customer care not able to help. Now another twist to this. I DON'T know where the order is but I got message it is delivered. After a lot of follow-up they said they refunded the money, but god only know who they refunded. As long as it is working you will like the service, but once you face issue your money gone.",1
Excellent service 👏👍🏻very proud and thankful to zomato captains and I gladly like to solute them for doing honorable 🎖work . If I orderd something the captain will reach me with in 10 min (on time) and food packing and food quality is excellent 😀 Tq zomato service😀,5
Till Now awesome experience... But add restaurant in pro segment.. Many Best and good restaurants are part of zomato pro..,5
Very fast delivery and the food was very nicw and the fastest delivery just in ten minute highly trusted app very nice app,5
"Subscribed to pro membership, but.. 1. Benefit of pro offer doesn't apply to all restaurants instead it applies to selected restaurant 2. Further its benefit doesn't apply to all order, you have to order more than 300 to get pro benefit. And maximum orders are 299 and below. They don't provide this information before sbscribing to pro membership. Rather subscribe and use it Eat club app, which has no such hidden terms and no misleading. My rs. 200 got wasted",1
Cumbersome. Not user friendly. No option to view my cart exclusively. Navigating thru the app is not crisp and clear,2
Great app functioning and well structured connect between all stakeholders involved. All the best!,5
Stupid marketing. They increase prices and give useless discounts. Overall price always higher than swiggy. I bought their stupid pro membership too.,1
I love this app you can have your food anytime and anywhere. And riders are superfast and nice.,5
Fast delivery nice nice app. and use full for for this app. 👌 I like that delivery man's r very honesty good visually.,5
Zomato deliveries are of great help during this pandemic. Really appreciate the efforts of each and every delivery person.,4
"Every delivery has some issue, and customer support is a joke, they will issue a mere discount coupon on your first contact, post that customer support keeps avoiding the customer. In this pandemic you have to pre pay for every order, & forget about the quality, timely delivery as soon as money is payed. They act as if they are feeding us at their own expense. Partial order, spilled food, late delivery you have to deal with everything, and also pay a service charge for this nuisance..",1
Every order was taking late to delivery..... As u wish Zomato was changing the time wats wrong ? And wat ur think abt us... For 2 items order was late and changing the time as u wish???? Worst worst behaviour... Not proper response..,1
Great app. Good options in terms of food and restaurants. Offers are also great,4
Convenient and turns back to your normal self when hungry. Thanks for being a savior!! :),5
Wow its really good. I love Zomato a lot . I travel every time for office purpose and I always use Zomato for my launch and dinner,5
No phone support. The valets don't deliver order. Chat support lacks empathy or sense of urgency.,3
"Zomata should not charge - surge charge and tip for the delivery boy open, both at the same time. Tip is fine we are happy to pay, but then why surge charge, if there are high delivery means everyone is doing good business so why rob the customers",2
Food item shows one price. Then when i go to place order the amount has increased substantially.,1
Great delivery options with mesmerizing food as well...great job zomato is doing.....,5
"Worst app, always showing surge and asking to order for above 275 for all restaurants.Everytime surge, worst, swiggy far better than you idiot.",1
Showing no restaurent available or not accepting any order now . But the same restaurents are open and delivery accepting in other apps .,1
Charges delivery charge as per order that is very annoying and also sometimes they even change the price of menu,1
Multiple order delivery by delivery agent is really not a good process. Edited my review considering the current real life situation.,4
Dabba app. Does not delivery food on time or in the correct location. Sometimes will not even provide service to your location. Best app for millionaires.,1
I'm happy with my experience with Zomato and have become frequent customer for sometime. But I have a reservation. I think the feature of getting a free delivery if the delivery boys are late is inhuman. I don't know If they pay a price but expecting them to deliver on time this way forces them to drive through traffic in an unsafe manner and puts enormous strain on them. I don't feel it's right. Zomato should think of better ways of providing great customer experience.,3
Love this app.. specially in such pandemics its gettin us fed.Great offers too. Try to reduce the delivery chrges... Thanks team zomato. Appreciate ur help and support here.,4
This time of crisis the most irritating part is when the riders and the customer care personnel are of no help. The atrocious behaviour of zomato riders / delivery guys. And the helpless customer care rep. There are many food delivery guys out there and amongst them the most disappointing is this. ZOMATO services. A BIG Zero.. very big Dissapointment for the industry. It's a shame.,1
"Your chat support ridhi and Shoaib , have terribly tortured me for 1 hour , my food didn't deliver in 1 hour I contacted the support ridhi said she will check and for 40 mins no resolution where in restaurant already told me that the order got cancelled somehow but these two support staff kept me on chat for 1 hour and I kept begging for my money back as I knew I won't get the food. But they kept me waiting and kept sending robotic text and eventually after waiting for 2 hours I had no food.",1
Because your app is initially showing 30 min to arrive then after ordered the food it's showing your food is arriving in 43 min.. What the hell is going on in your dirty app.. no fast delivery and charging sur charge due to high fuc*ing demand.. If you're getting lot of orders then increase your delivery boys.. Or don't take an order.. Or keep delivering boys more instead.. What is high demand.. Use less fellows I'm un installing your dirty app.. Good bye,2
App experience is awesome. But my all time experience of not delivering the gift card with gift delivery,4
Don't fool people's by giving fake coupon codes though PhonePe or other ways. I got coupon code of 60% off. But actual amount reduced is only 10%. Don't eat customers time it will backfire you badly...,1
Since last 3 weeks the app is super slow on Android....and not rectified. Worst user experience. I would say highly unprofessional. Waste of time. I'm no longer using it.,1
"Quite nice, easy and makes the online food ordering process very simple...thanks Zomato",4
The customer support is very good in interacting and in solving the issues and it's great to use this app,5
They show some prices and offers and they charge something else while placing order. Worst app. They don't have value for what you they show,1
"Finally coming out with this review after experiencing bad service, lack of support and proper solution. Worst part is you may get tricked by paying online first, always go for cash on delivery. Support staff is incompetent for redressal and the connected restaurants seems do not have good collaboration with Zomato. In conclusion, BAD, SUPER BAD experience with Zomato....!!!!",1
This app is not good because it shows fake ratings.. I ordered food after seeing good ratings but the food was bad at every order,1
Zomato is best idea thanks to the owner of this company for execution of such great idea in this live world because of you many people having there daily meals. Also appreciated to the delivery peoples who are serving peoples in this difficult lockdown period. Thanks delivery person you are next to God because of you people can have there meals. Thanks software teams for give support to this software 24*7 thanks customer care executives to providing support to customer 24*7 Thanks Zomato Team,5
Too expensive than in restaurant. Plus they add extra delivery charge too and quantity is also less than in restaurant.,3
"Just uninstalled zomato, and really happy to do that. Once i checked out a paneer kathi roll price of that roll was 200 and zomato gave me discounted price of 80rs which mean flat discount of 120 rs. The very same day i visited the restaurant price over there was 70 rs. Thats really awesome i really loved zomato",1
They combine multiple orders for delivery and it takes 45 min for a 4 km delivery. Food becomes cold by the time it reaches,1
"Worst chat support even for pro, I had never seen such a worst support from any other application, when ever we got for chat support only bot will, no agent support. whatever the issue we mention ""sorry for the inconvenience"" that's it no reply will come, terrible these too much worst support, we will order something restaurant will send some other food, if that food is not available why they keeping it in menu.",1
It was good in this pandemic they delivered my order within the time limit to the railway junction.... It so good do try it,4
Very poor customer service I have raised a complaint in chat and mail and even in app review also but there is no response from zomato and they are not ready to listen customer consernes also,1
"Wrost service, i had placed a cancel request for my order within 1 min of placing order, and food was not prepared or even started cooking bu still they refused to refund.",1
I used zomato app since 2016 and it would be great experience with zomato I've satisfied with their on time deliveries.!,4
So bad experience when i oder pizza that time the information is there will be 7 slice and i open the piza there will be only 4 slice and the pizza so costly and only 4 slice because now i don't order on zomato,1
customer service executivesreally needs to get some training. Couldn't get an update on order placed. Why charge so much extra when you can't even update on delivery.,2
Wonderful Service with range of offers. During pandemic Zomato served the cause which makes it super special.,5
Tracking needs to be improved. It stucks frequently and creates irritation. Developers look into this,1
"It's OK. Thx at crisis situation when I stay outstation, away from home during covid. But at times the food doesn't get delivered even after making online payment",4
Absolutely superb. I have no issues whatsoever. 😄I am happy with the app and its services.,5
I placed an order today. The app accepts the order but the restro calls and mentions they can't deliver. I wish I could rate you lesser than zero.,1
This is good app for food lovers so many restarents are there so many discounts are there good service and resanable prizes safty and stands are good beware of covid and fast delivery i love this app 😁😁😁😁😁😋😋😋,5
This app is very useful 😀👍 they provide to full time or either part time work I'm very happy to doing Zomato online orders I didn't have work to do in lock down but Zomato gave me a new chance where I could earn money without Zomato I didn't have any option to do work and full fill my family grocery.thank u so much,4
"Already i have used this app in AP and Maharashtra,but for my native place Berhampur,They served as a first experience as good as of my think.So thanks Zomato delivery boy for the before delivery.",5
"First make sure how are the foods which are being delivered, and all the photos are mostly fake .",2
I have places an order with zomato and from the restaurant Urban Paratha....well i have paid 239 rupees for the half tandoori chicken the delivery was 45 min late and when i just opened the pack got surprised to see the quarter chicken instead of half chicken (which was my order) ...i tried to search for complaint option with zomato but couldnt find it..i have photo of the item which i have received..its nit what i expect when placing an order in zomato i would better prefer to go and buy direct,1
Extremely bad and unprofessional experience today. My order was picked up by valet 30 min ago but he is still at restaurant to pick up order for other customers as he had been assigned multiple orders. Despite 2 calls innlast 30 min he is still at restaurant and refuses to come as system does not allow him. REALLY BAD EXPERIENCE.,1
It shows that a discount is available on main page and during payment there will be no codes this is just worst,1
"Speedy delivery , good UI....easy access to restuarants...also discounts are available..",5
Located right on the main road. Small outlet following all hygienic values. Pocket friendly filling the tummy. Worth it!!!,5
Really great app with sleek and nice user interface. Plus great discounts and promotions.,4
worst experience. first they showed coupon is applied and the grand total was xxx amount then they debited xxxamount +100 rs charge .and they don't even cancel the order,1
I would give zero rating to this app if I could the customer service is very bad that I placed an order and I did not receive my order. I don't know who took that order but I didn't recieved it,1
I personally feel Zomato is better than any other food delivery aap . In terms of offers n discount Even their customer support team.,5
The price of the food in restaurant and on Zomato are completely different and some feature called high surge wants me to buy more food .,1
They shows 30 min delivery and took more than hour to deliver within in 6km area...One delivery boy took multiple orders on same time and for opposite directions...,1
This app is significantly slow & it takes pretty long to place an order. Don't expect the users to enjoy the random fun food facts while they are hungry. Delays in deliveries is acceptable but delays in running the app itself is something that Zomato should really work on.,2
Easy and friendly. More over discounts. Really loved Zomato.,5
"I badly wanted a negative stars for this app, they have ultra professional who are well trained to con people, when you order they show you 30 mins. After 30 mins they still show 30 mins. They don't have call support and they have monopoly chat support, if you request cancellation for delay they forcebly sent order after like hour and ask you to take or no refund. I would suggest everyone always choose COD. Else these professional will play with your money and will dictate terms with time, qual",1
Rates mentioned in App and Actual Rates at Restaurants are different. We pay extra Delivery charges plus Zomato keeps a mark up in price plus Zomato recovers commission from Restaurant.,1
"Zomato cancelled our order and with so much argument we were given the refund.. Zomato promised us the promo code will be provided but now it's already 12 days and the Promo code is not yet provided.. I had a discussion with the executive today for more than 45 mins, still they have not provided the Promo code.. I had shared the screenshot as well.. but no response on the same.. Pathetic Service.. Pathetic Experience.. Uninstall this App guys.. they don't understand customer value..",1
Most of the time it takes more than expected time just because rider has been asked to pick many orders at a time.,3
Even though the bank give us certain promocodes to use... Zomato wil display invalid code... This is how they loot money from customers and also post a tie up with the bank.. Wish there was a negative rating...,1
"I am using Zomato for many years now. Recently, for about 1 week, I am having an issue. I can't open the app.",2
"Some times order may get delay, due to rain but some times it may not raining, it will get delay",5
"The most pathetic service ever. Paid for pro membership The biggest game in Zomato. I ordered a subway sandwich from a location which was 10 mins to my office. Order was prepared by the resturant in 15 mins post order, the poor guy of Zomato vallet was giving two delivries, one to me and one to someone who was around 30 mins away from that location, Zomato charges delivery fee on wvery order starting from 25 to 45 rs depending on them, and these cheapsters pay rs 10 for the second delivery.",1
"Really nice... Fast delivery, accurate timing, polite attitude of delivery men..... Really satisfied....",5
"Nice exp, fast and right time dilivery, with exciting discounts. And in lockdown zomato more needed to",5
"After updating the app I am not getting ""Meal for One"" option anymore however I was getting the same earlier.",1
Excellent and timely service. I received the parcel in time. Neatly packed. I appreciate the polite attitude of the delivery boy Manigandan.,5
Very good service. Lots of free promocodes and discount nowadays.,5
"Worst app, there no customer support. If we got wrong items or items missed in order no one will help us.",1
"Do not trust the food or the backhand service. I received food container out of which kne was completely sealed and other was very much opened. Also the customer service simply ignored me on the chat for atleast 30 mins. Do not trust the app. Its very very costly than the original menu on this app. ""DO NOT TRUST THE FOOD DELIVERED""",1
"Very expensive food on this app instead from this you can directly call to the restaurant and order,Zomato app is charging more than the menu",1
"Received unfresh order , complained in zomato chat for exhange , zomato executive gave the reason that restaurant is not picking up the phone so cant do anything...than I personally went to restaurant they cahnged it within a minute... Worst experience from zomato they have not any care for thier customers.",1
After selecting items when it reach upto view cart. The app comes out and unable to place order.,1
"Your chat function should have more options, delivery partner called and said he's at location which is not mine & apparently he's seeing that as my location due to map issue, there is no option in chat where I can say this. Not prob with agent it's the app, obviously both parties will get into argument unnecessary. And he's supposed to deliver ice cream which is already picked by the time he figures out my location now I'll get milk Shake in hand, + super high deliver charges",2
Zomato recieved the payment yet the order was not processed due to some issue and even the money was not refunded. Also zomato chat support didn't do anything to help.,1
Very nice experience and they also give very fast delivery within 20 to 30 min only.,5
"Ordered lunch and made the payment and shown on app my lunch will delivered within 45 mins. But after 1 hr no updates from Zomato, while contacted to Customer care they told your order picked up but that boy's mobile switched off so we will refund your payment. Total waste of 1.5 hours and re-order from alternative source. Zero rating for ZOMATO",1
Worst app ever. Does not auto detect location. You place an order and can't cancel it. It's like they operate in a world of super humans and you can't cancel ever. Then they don't refund money. Ten cc people have ten different solutions. Scammers.,1
"45 bucks of delivery charge plus atlest 40 bucks of taxes if you order something about 120, with delivery and taxes the bill goes above 200 sorry to say but I happen to know restaurants who offer free delivery. Swiggy is doing same thing.. Soo by by swiggy, zomato. Also the prices of the dish is way too high than the original Price of the dish if you go to that restaurant...",1
"Very good testy clean and very reasonable price, also quick delivery. And good service",5
please update location. whenever I'm ordering it will not come to my exact location I have ask the person to come to exact place. all the delivery person said you should have to chat with Zomato people. please focus on delivery the exact location. thanks,5
Very good options for food anywhere anytime. Very good service and support.,5
"While setting up Address it shows different address for the same exact location, please impove address selection on map",2
Best in providing instant help.. and having good range of restaurants.,5
"Never use ONLINE PAYMENT for zomato.. because they never refund your amount..only use ""CASH ON DELIVERY"" if don't want to loose your precious money. I had many many many bad experiences.",1
"The delivery charges with Zomato seems to be very high. Although we get discount through offers, more than 50% of the discounted amount is again collected back in the form of delivery charges, tip etc. The rest of the discounted amount will be covered in the form of tax. So there is no savings in ordering through Zomato, except the luxury of getting food sitting at home. But other service providers are not charging such a high delivery charges.",3
"It was Good app before they put order above ₹250 to place order, the resturant from which I order use to give good discounts and have good food . This change led me flew to ""Swiggy"" now it's good and I am ordering from that same resturant with no boundation of ₹ or what. Still 1 star for your delivery",1
It's nice application service and delivery boys are excellent.some of cheap people take advantage😡 of this boy.loved the app,5
Good the delivery boy BIJOY was very prompt and efficient. He specifically told the security to send my parcel asap. Since I'm in NSCI DOME I'm on the mercy of housekeeping and others. BIJOY was very prompt and good 👍👍 to him.,4
"Not using the proper navigation system, old data of navigation. Which shows wrong routing.",3
Well...the app is cool and i get what i want but i have one problem that i am facing i am continuing reviewing and adding pics but not able to check my zomato level..kindly help me with that thing...@zomato.,3
"Even after several contacts with customer service on chat. I am unable to download the invoice.. The email which I received says Click here to download the invoice with hyperlink. When I click on that it opens the Zomato app app and nothing is downloaded neither can open.. The Google chrome, IE in that also nothing works... Simple invoice download issue they are unable to resolve. Everything is buggy... Waste of time having this app.",1
Took zomato pro today. Unable to place any orders. Worst customer service. Agents are not responsive.,1
"Worst experience after ordering by zomato , delivery boys not delivering on time roaming here and there with order , also not refunding payment after cancelling after 1 hour of not delivering",1
Very good service in times of need when we doctors are separated from our families due to covid duties. Thank you,5
Dont buy any food they are cheeting customers very less amount of food they will provide and taking lot of money but the small kid also will not fulfill to eat its very bad experience in Mysore its totally wast restaurants in mysore,1
Your app is having a starting problem so improve it .It shows that it doesn't respond.so pl. Work on that.,3
"They allot multiple orders to one delivery guy that results in late delivery. And on complaining about the same, they will offer you a discount coupon of 60-70rs. We don't order food from Zomato to get a coupon or discount, we expect timely delivery so that we get the food in fresh condition. Your coupons won't remove the food's sogginess.",1
Very bad experience if you order at night then you have to wait for more then one hour. So Do not order at night time.,1
It mentions hotel is open n got a call from delivery boy that restaurant is closed. no easy app no option to cancel order.. no one responding on chat,5
"Order was delayed for more than 2 hours. Pathetic delivery and customer service. There is no way to reach out to the customer care executive and chat bot was not even helpful enough, it was looping the same obnoxious options over and over again. Delivery rider did not even pick my call despite of numerous efforts. This app is pathetic.",1
I like this zomato app very much because this has coupon code every time when i order something than order food delivery app.,5
"Zomato was really good in the beginning.I used to swear by it for 4 years.But in the past few months it's service has really gone down. 70% of the time there's an item missing in my order, it's such a hassle to contact the restaurant/deliveryperson/agent.Many a times the issues do not get resolved. I also have lost a lot of money ( close to 2k ) due to their & has not been resolved for me inspite of contact agents and the email service. Pathetic. Will prefer going out than using Zomato.",1
Order status monitoring is great 👍......service links with current best nodded restaurants would add advantages...,4
"Wastage of money, description good but material and quantity all others ... nothing is good.",1
"Today I gave an order of pack, where bevrege was missing from the bucket, however I was charged for that, on top of that order was delivered late. Very disappointed, want my money back.",1
My issue is still unresolved. Today it is more than 1.5 months when I have raised the issue and it is still unresolved. Thank you for providing this kind of service. I am uninstalling the app and switching to other applications who are concerned about their customers. It is of around 500 bucks only and you have lost a customer or I would say lot of customers from my family. Thank you for not looking into the issue.,1
Very worst service today..i am waiting for more than.one hour. Delivery boy picked first my order but he waited for half an hour.for another order. Also he delivered my order secondly. My ordered.food.is lost its hot. Very worst service.,1
Very very very late delivery!!! I received the order 2 hours after i ordered it when the restaurant is hardly 20 mins away from my house !,1
The service and timing are spot on...Well Done and keep up the quality of service,5
Nice app. But sometimes does not delivery to long distances. And Not all but some peoplewho deliver are rude..,4
Prices are also reasonable and the team is also hard working and polite.,5
"Verified options, safe delivery, good food! What more do you need! :-)",5
"ordered easily, and prompt payment and receive confirmation. good app.",5
Very user friendly and amazing offer and variety of options.,5
Super app I liked it because whenever i buy food from from swiggy no cash on delivery is available but in Zomato everytime cash on delivery is available wonderfull app swiggy very bad I hate swiggy and I love Zomato,5
"The service sucks. Order from Deliveroo. All the customer service does is apologise and thats it. I waited for 1/2 hour and got half my order. By the time the order was received and zomato's so called customer service responded the restaurant was not accepting delivery. All they did for ""compensation"" was return the money i paid for the food i did not get. I had people over and for all that embarrassment and inconvenience they did not offer any compensation nor did they get my remaining order.",1
All ok but why there is so much problem in your map..it's never showing actual zomato valet location and timing...,2
"One and only this app provides delivery in village area.. Very very thanks for this, Zomato😊😊😊 Just Awesom.. No. 1 food delivery app",5
Have been facing many issues with delivery in recent past (especially after subscribing to Pro). It seems the only motto is to get people to subscribe and then show true service levels! I've placed an order today at 12.05 pm since was told delivery within 32min. It's 12.45 already but delivery time is 18 more min! Based on me recent experience I won't be sure if I receive it at 3pm..,2
Good was delivered all spilt and when enquired Zomato representative says it's not his fault. Packing would have been a problem. As a customer i can't eat the food,1
"The order was delivered as packed by shop.No seperate packing by jomato,which used to be previously.",4
Very good and efficent work of zomatoe and it's staff. Fast and endurabke deliverys. Polite dwlivery staffs and good discounts. Keep it up zomatoe thanx,5
"Customer service is bad the people who work need to develop a more empathetic skill and not just reply thought the script, basic common sense would be able to resolve my problem it's sad to see how bad the customer service is, that too from Zomato . Amazing customer support it's been over 30 mins and they are still transferring my chat wooow so amazing ,good job Zomato keep it up. Best experience 😑 I'm done I'm deleting my Zomato account they are pointless even to be addressed just use swiggy",1
"Very good app for dilevery and very quick I havent got any ieusshu and it is 100 time better then swiggy and other dilvery app and very good customer service, keep it up",5
I always prefer Zomato over any other damn foodapps. It's secured and always make sure that their customers are satisfied!,5
"I didn't like the payment method at all i ordered a food which was cancelled and I am trying it with other restaurant but it was cancelled and suddenly I got a call from zomato that your order is been delivered from all the restaurant that was cancelled and I had a to pay a lot of money. I know you will not refund me my money, so plz improve your payment method.",1
"The reason I am making this 1 star experience as the app developer doesn't followed a basic privacy for the end users, where the delivery guys have access to the contact number of the end user. This is a huge risk whic leads to any incident. The app needs it be immediately chaged with a fetaure that if the delivery agent tries to call the customer, it should redirect using some VOIP mechanism and it doesn't show the phone number in the app.",1
I ordered food for my family suffering from covid. Waited for 2 hours. No response where is the order. There is no live tracking. You just keep waiting and waiting. There after order cancelled. Pathetic service. No accountability. No response.,1
Worst service.. Hopeless guys in Complain department.. Offering 96 refund for 299 bugs order that too with no further options to reply.. I know the food partner hence i am certain about the mistake is Zomato'z.. Hopeless...,1
Worst app dont download... From last three orders im receiving wrong orders.... And when i raise a complaint the say that send a mail... After that no response from mail also worst app waste of money,1
Before they were giving offers now they dnt give offers only service is good so giving 3 star. Dnt add donation amount without customer permission.,3
It's is all time fav for me ..if I m hungry at night I can't find in local but thanks to Zomato I can find something to eat for myself anywhere near me,5
"A very good app for online food order and fast delivery and good offers, I get up to 60% off on my first order... Thank you team Zomato",5
"It's no doubt,a site of great help. Did not give a 5 star,as the delivery charge is quite high.",4
"I'm waiting for the food since an hour. Haven't received it yet. The order was placed at 7:55, its turning to be 9, still the food hasn't arrived and they are asking me to wait another 17 minutes.",1
Nice and fast delivery Could be helpful with some more coupons and add some points or credits to make it intresting,5
"The delivery is always late. I don't blame the delivery person but the Zomato delivery assigning algorithm that assigns different orders to a same person. ""No one wants to eat their food cold"". And Zomato overprices the food , the price is totally different from the restaurant menu and Zomato menu , such a shame in manipulating the price and giving offers to users.",1
This app is completely useless. I ordered from subway 3 Times and not even a single time was the food delivered.,1
"I have been waiting for my refunds since many days and complained multiple times.The AI based chat box is of no use when you have personalises complains. I need my value back,580 Rs matters to mee.",1
Pathetic service. Order delayed by more than an hour. Worst was the customer chat service. The chat executive Bhavish was a novice and provided no help whatsoever. I asked him to cancel my order but he didn't even do that. Use Swiggy.,1
"Horrible. App crashing, Delivery calling and asking directions, no confirmation of delivery.",1
"The application interface/features are good. But you guys are cheating customers or rather forcing customers to pay more. When I add a food to the cart and order, I am asked to add food worth 125 rupees more to place the order. For eg, I want two chappathies and a chicken curry. You are saying that I have to take a chicken biriyani too to place an order. Guys, seriously what will I do with the biriyani? This is not right. This is forcing a customer to pay more to get his food. Very bad.",1
Nice app... Mostly stable... No issues till date... Good for consumer and seller both...,5
"We Are Facing High Demand So We Are Accepting Order Of 250 Or Above... What Is This Non Sense... And Its Not That This Is First Time I Have Noticed It Many Times And Thus Was Compelled To Buy More... Why Should I Pay Or Buy More When I Only Need To Buy For Myself... And Here You Guys ( CEO, COO, CFO, Head Of HR) Are Earning Crores Of Figures By Compelling Your Customers To Buy More... Great Man Well Done... Everyone Should Be Proud Of You...",1
I tried to add amount in wallet but it keep asking to update the app to load the money through credit card while I m using updated app.,1
The easy to order food and they give some of good offers and the app is easy to use to all,4
"I placed an order today, the valet delivered three orders before delivering mine. My concern is if you are charging delivery charges then my order should be delivered directly.",1
Useless services... Can't deliver food on time ... Actual waiting time is much mora than estimated time ..poor and bad service,2
"Worst service irresponsible and very unprofessional attitude. They only hire robots for sending you automated texts for your complaints. Pathetic experience. Delivery guy had no mask and smelly and filthy looking. Also argued on top of his voice as he didn't read the address completely in the first place. Received an open package. No sealed package. And this is my second review as they have deleted my first review. Also, they show out of stock items and take money from you.",1
It's good but sometimes it came to login again and again only that's the problem and else thing is good,4
Useless to order food. They give discount but the frustration is more than the money saved. If you book a seat/table at a restaurant then they don't value it. If you order food then they take more than one hour to deliver food which is 1 km away.,1
"Poor service they made me wait for more than 2 hours for my order till midnight and than cancelled order, unfortunately it was COVID curfew outside and had to sleep without food.",1
"Due to high demand and surge charges of ZOMATO, I have installed SWIGGY and guess what there super is better than your Gold.",1
Gr8 app. Customer service is really worth . They understand point and provide resolution very fast,5
Very bad experience....I gave order n the payment mode was COD but valet didn't have change so he suggested me to make online payment. After online payment valet was saying it is not showing in his system..my order cancelled automatically and valet returned without delivering the food and I lost my money..and plus I haven't eaten anything for the day bcoz I have to go to work..,1
"Earlier the experience was good but now i am uninstalling this app because its becoming costlier day by day, their is huge difference of Zomato menu prices and restaurants original price and also make it more costlier by adding more rates as we order any food . Overall, worst experience !",1
It's services are the best and food quality is best and the delivery boy is very precautioned in very thing i love the service,5
Zomato is very helpfull in this pandemic situations We cant go out and zomato is feeding food at doorstep . I really like this app,5
Delivery takes way too much time as compared to swiggy order my food half an hour ago nd still waiting nd still it's showing 19 minutes left on Zomato app highly disappointed,1
"If your order is delayed or if there is any issue with order, for instance worm found or something(which has happened with my orders), they don't do anything about it. This is really annoying, and everytime you reach out to them, they have same format of apology that they share across, pathetic customer service, I believe their business model is no longer about hearing to concerns. And so I have to delete my account, because I can't spend my energy resulting in frustration zomato gives me.",1
The only food app which I prefer to use... Coz it gives me lot of coupon codes to get a good amount of discount on my food.... And yes zomato covers almost each and every restaurant in my town... Which is quite impressive for me... And day by day zomato is coming up with some new updates which are suitable for everyone... And I hope they'll be coming with such more ideas of delivering good food... 😇😋,5
No effective customer service... That's quite annoying where you can't speak to anyone over the call to address your issues.,1
Offers were great and the delivery was early. Easy to place orders.,5
I did not get delivery to my order and delivery boy saying is delivered and not picking phone ... He has not deliver the parcel ... When He update about my orrder I asked I shall take in a minute and it took 30 seconds for me to go there and He was not there nor the parcel in my scoiety wing .. VERY poor customer chat service as well no concrete response yet.,1
"Good app, intuitive design and easy to navigate various restaurant menus....",5
"Great app, Fast delivery service, best delivery guys... Love the app and service",5
Prices are very high on this app according to the real price on shop. And quantity is very low on packing,1
"Something wrong with the delivery option...other services are too great. The problem is just with delivery. At first i order from a nearby resturant which took 15 Rupees for delievery, later I order again from the same which took 25 for delivery. Now I order from the same resturant and the same food but the delievery cost 35. I guess one day it will be increased to 1k. :(",3
Zomato you are awesome. Still you can deliver some distant location food by adding more delivery charge as few restaurant doesn't cover my location,5
"Fantastic App, Great Offers, On Time Delivery. 100%Satisfied till date.",5
"Just terrible. The last 3 orders were not delivered because they did not have the drivers. One order took 3 hours and still no delivery. Today one hour and 20 minutes and still no driver assigned. If you have kids like me that are waiting for this food, stay away from zomato, call the restaurants directly. Customer service is just disrespectful, they just respond with copy paste messages.",1
It's very easy to place the order. Quick and fast delivery. Thank you ZOMATO for working and helping the people in time by delivering the order. Also thank you for working during pandamic and Lockdown. Happy with your service. Thanks ZOMATO,4
"Very Good App for online food order, Doing a very needy and good Job in Covid-19 Situation Hats off to the delivery Boys👍😊",5
Worst delivery app. Got the wrong orders. Customer care services of the app donot reply. They don't treat the customers well enough.,1
Very good app is that everyone needs right now. We can’t get out of an epidemic crisis like Corona. In such a time it is a very good response and very good to all of you service. Thank you zomato..!!!,5
Excellent and responsive.. instant refund for the missing items in the order.love it.,5
"I'm giving it 2 stars just because of your staff which needs to be trained. The delivery riders are mostly unaware of the location. They don't even know how to locate address using Google maps. And your customer support doesn't even understand the concern. They probably need to learn how to communicate properly in English!!! Very frustrating! Almost 1 week now, and still no action has been taken. The rider is still unaware of the location 👏🏻. Rating changed from 2 stars to 1 star!",1
I'm enjoying this app now first I placed a mistake but i think you improved it now and your app is the safest to order!! 😍😍,5
"Zomato is one of the my favorite app for food delivery amazinng offers and good quality maintenance. Supportive staff, i appreciate your work .",5
"Was 5 stars until a few months ago. They've started charging 30% extra on MRP of the dishes, who the hell would want to pay extra? Uninstalled the app for this reason. Sad part is a lot of people don't even know they're paying extra. Talked to an agent regarding this and all I got was a response after 20 minutes saying we're sorry for the inconvenience.",1
Used to be best app and helped me a lot but now they are overpricing removed all offers and asking to join super.,4
I ordered upgraded and extra cheese pizza from foodies through zomato. I paid extra payment for this. But it's not found in that. The pizza bread was too much hard. I could not eat. I should have to throw in the dust bin. This is totally waste of money.,1
The app doesn't show the location of the restaurant we order from and since there are a thousand other rip offs and we end up ordering from the wrong location which not only charges more but also provides poor quality food. This is something that had nothing done about it.,1
Good but the delivery charges is too high and service charges is also included in taxes which is like a fraud,5
"not fun of Japanese food, but this one is really mouth watering..the foods are amazing! good price as well.. the staff's service are excellent..special thanks to zomato rider, he is so kind.",5
"The customer care is too bad to take concern under consideration. I ordered food and it showed more than 1 hour 15 mins time. I wanted to cancel my order but they refused to refund full amount. I had to retain order, expecting that they will deliver in given time. After one hour I checked and found out they had increased time of delivery ny 40 mins. No proper resolution by customer care even after reaching out multiple times.",1
"The most irritating customer service, 1, they kept non operational restaurant in live mode and took money for the order which they didn't deliver to me. 2, after ordering from Domino pizzas it takes more than 1hr 30mins still order didn't delivered and those idiots not lifting store nimber which Zomato provided. What kind of customer service is this. Shame on Zomato.",1
Last 2 order made me crazy and customer support is also no of use they are not going to help you with anything whether it's resturant fault,1
"Over the time they have started charging quite a lot as their delivery and service cost which is over and above the inflated menu item charges. Most offers are for bulk orders. However I mostly order just for myself because of which I can't apply most of them. Also not sure why they have removed meals for one segment, which was a saving grace for me earlier.",3
Not good. I booked order at 5 pm. I received it at 9pm. Go for swiggy instead.(not a swiggy fan but definitely it is better that's the only reason to recommend that),1
"Worst experience with Zomato, the chat support is not at all helpfull. They will not even response to the messages.",1
"Zomato has inflated prices. The same thing is available at restaurant for a lesser price. Plus they add delivery and handling charges which makes the same dish more costlier. Overall a Rs. 200 dish will cost you more than 320 without discounts. On top of this when you complain about quantity of food, they say restaurants have lesser portion size for zomato deliveries as compared to their regular dish size. So again customer is at a loss.",1
Lovely app its amazing makes order very easy and just happy using the app much better than any other delivery app,5
"Delivery charges are like that zomato is delivering in car but in reality I got my delivery on cycle inspite delivery charges were 50+. Worst Way to loot money from customer. Don't waste money on their PRO membership, its of no use as only few low rating restaurants included in the PRO discount list. Response to zomato, distance: 2 km, weather: sunny, charges 50+ inr, delivered on cycle in messy condition and on top of this I am pro member. Doesn't zomato response looks pathatic?",1
"Zomato notifications are too good, who came up with this g8 idea. And the food is also awesome.",4
It was a very use full app for food delivery and feeding so many home less people hands off 😍😍,5
I've always been disappointed with Zomato.. they've the worst customer service they have the worst delivery system. They will not look in the their quality... I uninstalling this app it's of no use writing your greviences too... Pathetic service,1
Orders placed by us are not sent correctly. Vendor give food items that are available with them and don't send what is ordered,2
"Worst app don't waste your money, food is not good they are not delivered proper food what you ordered. Even they don't have customer service number to raised your Consurns. If you want order plz go order apps.",1
"Quick search, multipe restaurant options, quick payment options, fast delivery.",4
"Been using Zomato for a long time now and always loved it but recently I'm starting to have issues with a lot of stuff. First of all I don't understand why the meals for one option was taken down, I loved it. Second, I see prices rising almost every month?! Your app finds millions of things to add, first a delivery charge, taxes and also packing charge sometimes?! What do you need delivery charges for? The entire purpose of this app is delivery. Disappointed a lot.",3
"Pathetic service. No one to.listen just you need to chat only. I ordered cheese bust pizza and I got ek dam thanda pizza, no cheese at all. I paid 530 rs for this pizza. After this experience there is no one in Zomato to whom I can explain it. Local pizza shops in streets have more tastier pizzas then dominoz. Sorry but true",1
I will give 5 out of 4 star but only two problems 1) food price is too much 2)less code is there in zomato,4
"The application should provide the honest timming for the time taken for arriving. It keeps on showing 16 minutes however originally it takes more than half an hour(Even if you refresh or close the app and start again). Consumer's time is taken for granted here! Just a reminder, time is money!",2
Offers should be up to 70%.and restaurants prices are also high.delivery charge should not be applicable,1
"I used to love ZOMATO but it's getting worse day by day which is forcing many people to switch to swiggy permanently. I tried to sort out a problem with the customer service but even after 27 min of chatting and explaining nothing is solved. Whenever, I had a problem with swiggy,10 min to solve it This is pathetic and this is main reason ZOMATO is not able to compete with swiggy. The promo code problem got sorted out but took 2 days to do so so I am chang from 1 start to 3",3
"Superb, time on delivery, good communication( especially anees) some foods are not that much tasty but iys ok",5
App is good but customer support is worst. Customer service needs to improve that's why 3 star.,3
"I'm not sure if this totally deserves 5 stars. Because a lot of hotels put hiked prices on the app. And still add packaging charges and service charges. Then Zomato adds delivery charges and other taxes. So sometimes even with discount, the food is twice as expensive. But this is the most hassle free and good customer service app out there (in India). Swiggy needs to learn a lot from these guys to at least get a decent rating. And the other food delivery apps are too trash to even compare.",5
"Zomato is great. Faster than any other delivery service platforms. I would have loved to give 5 starts but there are some defects they need to address. I always have this problem of getting less food, not properly packaged or sealed. I am always suspicious on the delivery guys. I would love if they implement small bags like Amazon, which will get stretch when tried to open. So the customers will be sure the food is sealed and not manipulated with in between.",3
Worst customer service ever... They first ask to explain our problem... When we explain all the things they will say they are receiving high inflow and will ask to again write a mail to some idiotic mail id from where u never get any reply.... Like explain things multiple times but will not receive any response .... They think customers are idiots they don't have other work... They have only one job to follow up with Zomato all the time and order things like idiots... WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE,1
No refunds are provided when the fud delivery is late .They says it is refunded when it's late but they only provide 25 rs token which is not a compensation for the loss .,1
Horrible. Chat support is just a bot type conversation. They send you templates again and again. No calling support. They offer you coupons of Rs 75 everytime you have an issue. It feels cheap. They throw a piece of meat and want to hide their shortcomings. Two Worst orders in a month. Everytime you make a complaint they will act as they had a word with the restaurant and then will revert you back and ask you to treat is as an exception. And they trust restaurants more than the customers.,1
Zomato is not allowing me to order from nearby or far restaurants once I wanted to order food from a nearby restaurant at that time it said ' currently not deliverable ' or will say 'will not deliver to this location . This should be fixed.,1
"Lot of things to giving low star ratings. There things like delivery surge charging extra money even after paying delivery charges. Taxes are also being including. If you are hungry then Zomato makes advantage of it ,suggests you to make an extra order or to reach cut off price . If you're under the cut off price the order will not be placed. So you will be still waiting by starving . If you order something they won't take care about package they bring the food in plastic cover which cost 0.50",1
"One star. First they accept your order, deduct money.. And then they call a restaurant to cancel the order and you wait money for 7 days. Horrible, I really dont reccomend.",1
I has limitations for your payment. It frusstrates me every time i order something. Very bad. It was showing i cant exeed more than 350.,1
Just sending third class lines in notification won't work. First of all there is huge parity between the prices displayed on this app and the actual restaurant.( More than 30%) On top of it u add restaurant packing charges Plus exorbitant delivery charges. ( If u have the number of restaurant owners they themselves are ready to deliver at Ur doorstep at less than what those extra 30% accounts for) Uber eats was way better in prices rates quantity and delivery times to.Zomato not even close to it,1
Very bad service. Always delayed delivery. No flexibility to cancel.,2
App is not working. Continuously shutting down. This should not happen atleast this lockdown period.kindly fix,1
Payment option alwys showing error and no other option available to do correction. For which unable to place order.,2
I would be glad to give 0 stars if possible! I mean what the hell they always say they charge some extra 40/- due to high demand for the restaurant if they don't order above some certain amount like 300/- or 400/- . I mean it will be same for every restaurant. I mean who the hell will order for 300/- just for 1 person. This app sucks!! Switching to Swiggy. People don't use this stupid app anymore they are literally cheating people,1
I show different offers for different people if we raise any complaint they will cut the offers from the restaurants And some time delivery no received but it shows delivered when I call delivery boy mobile switch off,1
Good vas All good things need upgradation this to needs some easy features and more importantly very importantly MORE DISCOUNTS & FREEBIES,4
"Such a worst experience I had got a bad food,after reporting it they asked me whether u need a promo or a refund but they gave me a promo,after a discussion they were not even replying.",1
"Order-Two Valets requests to cancel order - Chat Support tells we will deliver-After an hour, I ask chat support- Can we cancel your order.... Wow. If I would communicated next year they would have informed that ,, Can we cancel your order...",1
Useless delivery system....no prompt response. Even though the delivery person receives the order and the distance of restaurant and address is less than 1 km it took 50 minutes to deliver the food. When called the delivery person he said restaurant did not deliver the food and Kept him waiting,1
Most of the times delivery of food and drinks items of orders are just exceptional.Feels great when u get such service 😊,5
"Had terrible experience with Zomato.It has been happening for sometime. Last night my order was cancelled because they couldn't send any one to pick it up. When asked for the return, I was asked to wait for 5 days. The representative was giving scripted responses, and sidi not answer me, when I asked him whom to get in touch with to follow up for the refund Swiggy is far better than zomato. Have decided to uninstall this app, once and for all",1
"Worst Policies... Chat agents are not for customers but they represent Hotel/Restaurants. When you order and paid the order. Zomato doesn't have any reponsibilty. No food, No refund, no replacement. They dont think, that the customer may have diabetes and must need food, and not refund. Extremely disappointed... #ZOMATOLOOT",1
"One word - BAD. The delivery exe do not wear masks or wear a flimsy mask. The support team doesn't respond for hours. The refunds are not fast. Support team is unsupportive. And keeps on repeating from a list of msg. Support team is unintuitive and doesn't even read our msg properly before responding. I had to explain one 8 times what was wrong with my order, which had wrong ingredients from what I'd selected. And there's no escalation desk supervising the support team. Just bad.",1
I have ordered first time after lock down. And I am very sorry to say it was one of the most bad experiences I have ever faced. As my parcel having half portion of the total container. I don't know what is the reason behind that. From the restaurant I have ordered is very known and I know how much portion they gave as I ordered from there earlier. Please look into this matter or this will be my last order from zomato.,1
Good app I love and I respect my brother and sister who are giving their 100% to full fill our stomach ..... But only one suggestion from my side don't give food for free in case order was late ..... And customers should know about their efforts and please don't ask free food,5
"all the time u said can I install 💯 cupan what it's mean satisfaction is nothing for Zomato and , if somebody order something that means he/she is hungry u should have to give the food not money , money have everyone that why we are ordering something ...",1
no proper assistance and have put a convention fine for cancelling the order even before delivery executive being allotted.. poor communication,1
"Okay , food ordering app, works fine, but Is kinda ""fooling"" you , this app claims """" upto 50% off"" in every ad they show on every other app, still I don't know somehow I always feel the food is over priced , Never get the "" claimed "" discount, Plus they tak around 60-70 rs extra for a order of 100 rs in the name of "" delivery & taxes"" Where on earth did they charge that % tax , I mean this app is looting us .",1
"We have ordered one veg cheese sandwich and chicken grilled sandwich, but we have received chicken salad instaed of chicken grilled sandwich. Immediately we raised an issue. What ever the item we received wrong that we have shared a pic. As veg cheese sandwich is fine we dint take a pic of that. Zomato customer care asked both the pics which we couldnot produce and they failed to solve our issue.",1
Facing issues when making payment. It takes several minutes to see the OTP screen,2
"Very high delivery charges compared to swiggy! They add this extra delivery surge fee by just saying the restaurant food is in high demand,pay rs.40 more to book your order.I want to understand on what basis do you say so and the restuarant's food is in high demand. Isn't it everywhere? All the time? Or do you call every restuarant and ask""Hello sir, our Zomato team is predicting you will be selling 5 shawarmas in another 1 hour, Do you have enough stock for it? Or should we swiggy it?""",1
"Anytime a restaurant isnt able to deliver on time, I will change the rating to 1! Zomato really takes your membership for granted. Giving discounts isn't enough (and 20aed is a miserly one considering you charge 7-10 aed for delivery!) especially when you don't deliver by the promised time. PUNCTUALITY IS AN ETIQUETTE - please learn to practice! The only good thing about your app is Reviews.",1
"Don't use because it is scam . We have ordered from one restaurant they will serve from another restaurant which cost low price . The costamer service is warst I never see it because of the were told same thing write letter to Gmail . When you write a letter to Gmail they will not respond properly. So , don't use if you use you lost the money . I think instead of Zomato use swiggy.",1
"Issue with estimated time. While booking it was showing 30 minutes but once I have ordered, suddenly it changes to more than 1 hour delivery time. Since it is estimation, I can say +/- 10 minutes is ok but adding more than 30 minutes to estimation is misleading. Even I have spoken restaurant owner and he agrees with my view. Thier customer service agents say ""I don't have any comments"" when asked about it. This kind of misleading is not expected from Zomato.",1
"Experiencing the best and fastest delivery on zomato , food condition is very good, ru nning the app is so easy",5
Its easy to use the app and you have a huge variety of foods and you can get it from anywhere in the city.,5
I hav ordered first time on Zomato yesterday night....I received wrong item... different from which I ordered...and when I raised concern about that then they said that they resolve the issue in 48 hours...it's not the electronic item that I can wait 48 hours...it's a food item and you are taking 48 hours...Bravo...Proud of you...clearly mess...don't expect this from you Zomato...Swiggy is 1000 times better than you.,1
"Hi zomato, i have experienced some difficulty with my last order. Due to that, I'm very disappointed with your app. I tried to contact zomato customer care regarding my last order to know the cancellation or change the item, but i was unable to connect after waiting for a very long time & there is no direct number to reach customer care. I'm going to uninstall the app. Thank you for your services.",2
"Very bad service interms of delivery person reacting and basically the delivery guy gives silly excuses towards the timeline of delivery and he keeps asking where you have ordered ordered again and again to, this is very basic Information that the delivery guys should have , Dont know whom to blame and on the other side swiggy did the best Job on the delivery timelines and no need for calling them , they call us . I would strongly recommend Zomato Team to be extra cautious towards the delivery",1
"There is no option for 0 rating, hence 1. Today I ordered and the app showed status as delivered but without delivering me my order. When I talked to the restaurant they confirmed of picking up the order on time, but delivery vallet kept fooling that he has not picked up yet and by mistake he has marked as delivered. Later I tried with the chat box people but they had a new story every time. After 2 hrs of misleading cancelled my order. Horrible.",1
Awesome rate and fast delivery Rates are not like swiggy zomato give you restaurants rate and his delivery charges Swiggy didn't do that his rate are higher than restaurants rate plus delivery charges swiggy sucks Zomato rocks,5
"Worst customer service,pathetic reps on chat,worst calling service..... These guys are not up to the mark with policies and procedures , accept orders and then make it a mess. Ridiculous experience",1
"The app is not at all compatible. The support staff didn't bother to reply for issue. Orders get cancelled half hour after being accepted and zomato didn't even bother about it. Support staff is lame, lazy, not taking ownership, didn't bother to reply. The chat trnsfer from one person to another. Not having option to rate the support staff person or experience. Lame app. No calling support option Available.",1
Very bad. The customer care executives are like abusive robots. If you tell them to change the way to talk they cut the call. They don't resolve your issues and create another. Its really frustrating when you are hungry in the evening and have very few options. These apps just take big chunks of funding and keep cheating people.,1
"The customer care support system is pathetic. They just try to make their job easier by dismissing your concerns on frivolous grounds- they seem to not even read your issues properly. If your food is good then good, but if you order regularly or often, issues are bound to crop up and you won't get am effective resolution. No compensation, nothing.",1
"The app is amazing,. However the cooking instruction button has to be clear enough because i was ordering food with spices I'm allergic to, And it took me time to notice the button and I still forget where to find it.",4
"TOTALLY BAD & WORST SERVICE BY ZOMATO. This is the worst app in terms of customer support. I ordered food from Gwalior Sweets (Surat) yesterday. There was only water in the food and all the food was not edible. We had to waste all our food and throw all food in dustbin. Your Customer Executive r very irresponsible. There was no one listen and solve our problem. We can't cook food at home, so ordered with ZOMATO. Yesterday was terrible just because only of ZOMATO. I wasted my money and my advice to others is never order through ZOMATO",1
"It took more than 2 hours and nobody delivered my order, that caused us to cancel our order instead. The restaurant called me after 2 hours of waiting just to ask for my address and telling there is difc word.. Obviously my address was well stated on my account and i was a regular customer.of zomato ages ago. I wonder why would he ask such stupid question only after 2 hours of waiting for them.. We were trying to call them but nobody answers their phone. Very disappointing",1
The service is pretty good. And the customer service support is very promt.,5
Best services and above all you cover more area for delivery as compared to competitors... Keep it up guys!!!,5
20 min delivery promised but order received after 1 hr but in app still showing 20 min delivery or cash back..,1
Nice app.. but service is not that good.. it can be better.. it's take so much time for delivering the parcel.. when pracel arrive at home it's been so cold.. my suggestion is u should deliver the food in just half an hour,3
Pathetic customer service.. Zomato app always assign multiple order to single executive and force us to wait for more than the time mentioned while ordering.. Best thing is you can't cancel your postpaid order and support executive make sure that you accept the order even if it's get delivered after 2 hours and completely cold.. Pathetic app and support..,1
"Such a worst service given by zomato again. After ording a food in app, it showing order is accepted by restaurant and after some time showing delivery person is on the way to deviver order in 10 mins. But finally got call from service and saying the food is out of stock in restaurant. When food is out of stock how Zomato saying food is accepted by restaurant and even delivery boy is on the way to deliver. It is done by 11pm where can I order after that and my money also blocked with Zomato.",1
"I was trying to order from my favourite pizza place and the app said that restaurant is not accepting orders because no delivery partner is available. But when I checked another restaurant in the same building, they were accepting orders and delivery partner was available there. How is this even possible? The app is full of glitches and no one gives a damn about the problems faced by the customers and restaurants. P.s. the other restaurant which is accepting order use only zomato delivery boys.",1
Sometimes it does have glitch which is ignorable but the UI is good.,4
It is great app for home delivery during pandemic. As it also have live location.,4
"Diducted amount but food not delivered. On reaching to support they said it's all right and they can't do anything about it.No refund or anything. Support chat was almost mocking and also nobody reached to me , I couldn't even file a complaint as they didn't tell me how to do it or where to do it. Remember you guys are not good because food is good, restaurant is responsible for food . You guys have just one work to deliver the food and you suck at it. Ignore this also , Customer who?",1
Good user friendly and most of the delivery charges are free that's what like the most,4
"The customer service is absolutely ridiculous!! There is no support whatsoever. Its becoming useless to make an order through their app ,coz its the same as making an order with the restaurant itself . Even if a delay of 2 hours is reported all they say is kindly wait 15-20 mins ,we will look into it .Making excuses all the while without making any Real efforts to help the customers. Its not the delivery agents fault but Zomato doesn't check whether their partners are capable",1
Prices are highly placed than the restaurant and customer service is pathetic. They end chat without proper closure,1
"Excellent app experience, interface, easy to use & work very well.",5
"Placed order from Naturals, delivery boy calls and says that he is coming within 2 minutes, after 2 minutes, the app shows that order is delivered and when we called the delivery boy to know the actual status, his phone is found to be switched off. Terrible experience!",1
Very good experience of placing order and order tracking. User friendly app,5
"Worst service. I have ordered some food from Haldiram Patna. But one item in that order was spoiled. I complained to zomato, but they did not responded. So please do not use this app. Worst experience in the very first order.",1
After updating app it's very slow..it takes 15minutes to go in next tab aftr selection of anything.,4
"I am literally hating your app!!!! Just hating it, it's 1Am, restaurants are open, I want to order just a Choco Shake and it shows minimum order of 225 else there will be additional 50 bucks charged!!! Like seriously you're saying at 1Am there is increase in demand????!!! I legit talked to the owner from whom I normally order and he says there were no orders since last 2 hours!!! Utterly dissatisfied and disappointed.",1
"Have been waiting for my refund of membership that was promised. Several emails sent to follow up and no refund was made in spite of providing details, which they acknowledged in January. Till now nothing. Totally unacceptable!! ****** I had communicated with online feedback. Unable to attach copy of my correspondence. Is there a number that I can call to talk to someone?",1
Delivery charges are very high. Otherwise app is full of 5 star.,3
"Faulty app, order gets placed without showing order summary page where user can enter coupon, select payment option",1
Nice app faster delivery wthere it's raining or sunny day there moto is to deliver the item at time,5
Once you place your order it's saves your payment option and after that while placing order your order gets placed without any verification confirmation . No doubt there has being fraud happening while placing order. It's a no no to use this app. May one get to order easily but it risk our bank details. Plus if you try to have a word they give you many options to select but not explain your concern.,1
When it works its fine but when it doesn't which is a few times...... Vvv frustrating for a hungry person.,2
"Good. Fast delivery, but food is less they are showing full bowl. But it's not goof qtq Plz check this madam / sir",4
"Problem -1::: Worst app, don't trust it , no one will help you even if your order missing... I had experienced ,money debited, order didn't received, No use if you complained or mailed... Don't waste your time... Zero customer support... After long gap: Food item is - 230/- Delivering fee- 57/- Taxes and charges- 30/- Coupon - (-80/-) Arround 240 need to pay . My house is only 2 km distance, Same food in Restaurant without Zomato - 200/- .... I don't know what kind of business is this.....",1
The food came at time. It's a very good app. I was really satisfied with the food.,5
Service through app was good. But the quality and taste of food is disappointing.,3
"Useless service, extra charges plus waste service, late service 🐕‍🦺 Dogs! Ext- Useless reply, one hour late almost 4 out of 6 deliveries. Shame on you, Dogs!",1
I recommend to go as per your schedule which is shown for delivery.(even considering the traffic factor)I ordered on 12.03.2021 and was shown a 30 min delivery.. Eventually the pickup boy was not moving in map and when called after 20 mins gave a excuse any that he will go and pick up ..Wow..what a support. ? Thanks to his concern that he is going atleast. Switching to different app after this.,1
"Pathetic experience with Zomato offlate. After spending time to place the order, waiting for the order to be prepared, they cancel orders for the want of a valet. C'mon... You are supposed to be a food delivery app. Sometimes an order cannot be placed bcoz the restaurant went offline while we were ordering. Sometimes an item isnt avaliable after we have selected it and proceed to checkout. You gotta fix it else you'll lose our trust and your business.",1
Ordering food through zomoto is very convenient and their customer service response is also good,5
"The delivery time first shows 30min...then after 5 min increases to 45min. Then if we want to cancel order, it says restaurant is preparing ur order. This is worst customer experience so far... firstly show wrong info, then increase delivery time for your own convenience and don't allow customer to delete order within 5min of ordering.",1
Zomato is better than swiggy in (n) number of things. They serve food on time and there customer care service is also execellent.,5
Easy to search and place an order. More offers all time.,5
"The order delayed and first time I got a message that order is 1 km away and will take 2 mins. After few mins it become order is 2 km away and its going to take 5 more mins.. It kept on increasing. Called driver and driver mentioned 2 kms away.. Zomato kilometer logic is not working with chatbot. I moved zomato from swiggy and looks like zomato is also clever. Other thing is i used to give 30 rupees tip and now my min tip is 30, where as my friend do not give tip and minimum tip for him is 20",1
The worst app I have ever experienced they deducted my money n told me they will refund in 24hrs y would I wait for 24hrs they should sent me my money back that time itself if a normal person doesn't have money if he has the last money then how will a person survive really bad experience n worst app plz don't order from zomato order from swiggy its btr. It's been 5days still I have not got the money back,1
"Sometimes price of products is higher than price of same product in restaurant. COD option should be more available, sometimes it is restricted. Also it asks for location each time despite filling in the location. At times menu on app is something else but outlet says it does not offer that item, so menu is not always current or up to date. Delivery staff often unable to figure out location or address despite being told many times and call again and again and sometimes poorly behaved.",1
Uninstalling the app due to coupon code issue of Zomato....customer support team is useless they keep repeating their few lines given them as a script.,1
I Unsubscribed from pro...even I paid twice for that....I raised complaint and didn't get any refund it's been 9days,1
"After ordering food, zomato chat took almost 1 hr but they are tranfering chat from 1 person to another and no reaponse.",1
Very good response. From last week. The agent will respond after 60 minutes. They will send very polite massage. Please we will take your feedback for our better things. We lost our money for their betterment.,1
Very poor experience. There was a coupon code called tasty which meant a50% discount. I applied it and made the payment only to realise that the code was not accepted. Chat with the customer service executive within a minute was of no avail. I am just surprised with the complete apathy to customer requests.,1
This is a very nice app to order food online.The food reaches on time really like this application,5
"Unable to get in touch with support. Have faced a few issues with my orders (missing products from order) and there is no way to get it rectified or some help. Zomato chat does not load and only says 'this is taking longer than usual...'. And Zomato does not have a customer support phone line. A couple of issues where okay to ignore, but such issues are piling up. Without adequate support, Zomato usage doesn't sound practical.",1
"The service is good,,,easy to use the app, I suggested to Zomato provide intresting offers,the present offers is not really good",3
very good app to order food. helps a lot if you are too tired to cook or home after a long tiring day. their delivery guys are also on time and hardworking too. we can understand if there is some time difference because of the traffic. let us be patient for those who go out of their way to get our food delivered to us. it's a pleasure to order from zomato. always good experience.,5
Excellent service.. Great benefits for the customers.. quick and easy 👍 100%satisfied 😊,5
"Finding the best dishes could never been easier,now I can eat all the dishes I like,finding new resteraunts and offars are fun to get discounts as well,if not I could just fill my stomach with the pictures of the meals:)",4
By mistake a order is placed u can't cancel even on next sec. So if it's placed for 3k by ur kids that's it. No confirmation option as well,1
The Worst app The restaurants never send the right order receive end up not delivering the Food right DON'T DOWNLOAD. Customer service will never solve your problem,1
Great application.. very professional and practical. And they have surprises to u from time to other 😉😉,5
"Intially it was good ,but now it is worse than you can think ,it delivers food late ,if food item is missing or if food item is incorrect they will not help you out,no customer care ,no real time instant chat support,you mail at order@zomato they reply you after 10 days ,in that mail also they say they will refund but the money will not be credited when you revert them again they again we don't have clear picture of order missing they are asking for the image of the child which is not born yet!",1
Very bad experience. The customer support executive does not respond to our messages. Very very bad. Never order from this site. I received the wrong person and they are not paying any heed to my complaint.,1
Always a hunger saviour... Be it Day or Night... All good restaurants and the delivery is also fast n accurate,4
"Each time we order from Zomato there is a problem in the delivery. It has been observed that the people at the restaurant delay the order from Zomato on purpose god knows for what reason... And many times one or two items are missing. There is no customer care service to address this issue or a person from their end whom you can speak to and adrress the issue. Some of the restaurant have even gone to the extent of saying that why do you order from zomato, we can send the order to your house.",1
Late deliveries are very common with Zomato. I am in heart of the city and still they deliver as early as 60 minutes very often,1
"The app shows wrong detailing of the serviceable restaurants quite often now. The restaurants are actually open for the service at the time of placing the order but app does not take the order of that particular restaurant, sometimes it does shows the availability of the restaurant. This leads us to call directly to the hotel and place the order.",2
Very poor service App shows order delivery time 30min and order is delivered after good 90mins..,1
It's nice and easy to order and the delivery partners are very friendly,5
All apps working fine except zomato in my phone.. I have Samsung A30.. Nothing loads in less than 5 min,1
Every delivery there is some or the other issue. the customer service is also verg rude and doesn't know how to talk to a customer. They argue a lot and don't have any information on how a food is eaten. Problem on every order and no proper service.,1
Its one of the best app where we can get amazing offers on food.,5
"Zomato informed of not delivered on time is free, but it was not followed. I found this to be cheating the customers. When chatted with customer care ( as they don't have a call option), they informed that we may get only a 200/- coupon and not free...This is ridiculous. And the process is very confusing.... RIDICULOUS Today on 14th Feb 2021 when I tried to order, there is no option whatsoever to redeem my free coupon which I won due to delayed delivery last time I spent 1 hour searching.",1
"Not just seamless online portal but zomato must focus on control over restaurant and their Quality, hygiene & safe delivery standards. Restaurants must honour zomato policy and and the food packing standards need to review.. As the food packing is not sealed and not sure if it is getting opened at mid-May. Its risk to order food online after some bad experiences. Request all people to be careful with such online food order companies.",1
Now my oder is getting delay it shows 12 mins from 6.44 pm and now it's 7.14 still showing 11 mins to deliver so I hate it am not going to use or recommend it any more thanks for ur soo far services.,1
Zomato is getting pathetic day by day. No intent to help or understand the customer when they can't deliver what they promised. I am thinking that the intent is now just earning the money. Customer representative are just hired for the sake of it and they totally avoid the customers,1
its a great app but there is only one issue that is the coupans provided are mostly for online payment...pls provide coupons on cod also ...,5
"Excellent initiative with no delegation to fix issues faced by customers is as good as the shop next door which is closed. Poor after service specially when the fault is theirs. They have the audacity to reiterate that the fault is theirs but they're not going to do anything about it!! As a company there was not one person who could have helped, that's sad!! Real sad. Friends uninstall and move to another provider unless you like hearing sorry from zomato.",1
good app fast delivery with good offers... always happy while using this app ...,4
"Zomato changes the price of dishes from x to y n then puts additional delivery n parking n packing charges aswell. They are making more money then the restaurant owner themselfs, fantastic loot",1
I have to say that the food i ordered was amazing. And the delivery boy was very polite towards me. Also the food was on time as promised.,5
"Really bad experience with Zomato. After waiting for 2 hours Zomato cancelled my order, and for refund I need to wait for 5-6 working days. Never use Zomato service, better to go with other online food delivery service. It's not reliable, you don't know when they will cancel your order. Review on 12th Feb 2021. Hi Zomato, Instead of adding same comment to all the user. Reach out to individual customer to resolve this pro.I am not gonna write email please reach out to me on my registered no.",1
One of the worst customer service experiences ever. When trying to resolve a problem the customer care executive told she will connect me to an agent who specialises in that matter and connected me to a bot for queries. This is simply not acceptable. I bought zomato pro last year but the benefits are next to none if you had to bear with such customer support and one of the worst delivery systems where your order is placed only if it is above a certain value. Email support is useless.,1
"Pathetic app, Not worthy of any starts 1. They deliver food after you wait for 2 hour or so by then the food is cold and you lose your appetite. 2.Customer service is horrible and rude, no empathy . 3.They charge you delivery and let restaurants do the delivery. If this is the case, why order through zometo, can call the restaurant and order directly. Guys there are several other new delivery applications try them. Hopefully should be better and competitive.",1
"Very convenient, and good network for prompt delivery.",5
"If you have missing food or get a wrong orde, do have it, their support will be experiencing high flow queries because of their wonderful ""support"". Try to reach them via call, chat, email; you will definitely get a reply but that will be an automated one. I think they should try filing a missing persons case for their agents or did they ended up making it all A.I.? No wonder their delivery staff follow the same path of agents",1
Overall Good Experience using the app! Generating Employment and building a great business with highly User Interactive Interface truely deserves a 5 ⭐,5
I really love this app.I would give 10 star if possible..Really better than all online food delivery.,5
It only respond properly when we are new the app.. Later on doesn't even make it easy for customs.. Wating watiniand wating it's the biggest issue this app has..,1
"last 1 month all most every day I ordered from zomato and the food quality was pathetic, not getting option to chat with agents and I have mailed atleast 5 times only getting a systematic reply, found hair on food shared that but no reply, it's becoming worst day by day, there are no options to speak with agent.. pathetic..I ordered 4 ice-creams, received 2 and the agent told me they will give me my refund, there are no refund, even found hair and egg shell in my food, no reply.thief, fraud",1
"Guarantee Delivery - Cheap trick. Today I ordered breakfast with Guarantee delivery option, zomato cancelled the order after 30min, saying that restaurant couldn't deliver some of the items so they cancelled it. But I spoke to the restaurant guy, he said that they haven't cancelled it. Since I opted for ""Guarantee delivery or amount return"", zomato cancelled the order when they knew that it can't be delivered in time. Such a cheap strategy from zomato.",1
Worst service.. They dont even reply for inconvinience we face. Support system is worst. Very bad service,1
"Before asking about the app.. Please work on the delivery policy you have.. The calling the customer and if he doesn't pickup you cancel the order is not a best practice The address is given if the number is not reachable or switched off or no response, You are before the residance for god sakes, so please ring the bell or check with security When you go to relative house and when you call them if they dont pick up you ring the bell and not cancel the visit and leave Delivery charge???",1
"It's amazing in many ways like food quality,delivery timing and all,loved this one",5
"The new update has a better user experience. But the contrast can be a bit more like the filter for sorting cannot be spotted easily as it merges with the white background. Rest all is superb with this application. Really love it! One more suggestion is to bring back the figure that how many customers have rated the particular outlet, which seems to be removed in the latest upgrade.",5
"I am very Disappointed with zomato,they are only concerned about the restaurant not the customer for any comain if u raise the query or complaint they only support restaurant they are only concerned about there money but not customers satisfaction",1
"There is always extra charge will be added on the bill, I have verified by adding same food itme from same restaurant in Zomato and other apps like SWIGGY and I found difference in the price, in Zomato there is always extra amount will be there by the name of taxes or packaging charge which you will no see in other food ordering app.",1
"Person told me that Zomato gave him two different orders in same time that's why he reached late. I want to ask you, should I uninstall the app Zomato It was my first experience with You and your person was standing at a particular point for more than 45 minutes (as seen in app)",1
"they even don't see if food is hot or cold, they recently delivered food poisoning to me, looks like was made 3-4 days earlier",1
"They used ro help you out with when your orders were getting delayed. Or else at least, they would refund your money through zomato credits. Nowadays it's pretty common to have to wait for over an hour for a fast food delivery. Zomato help doesn't do anything except to try to calm you down and never even offer to refund your money. So I switched to uber eats and Talabaat. Life is so much better now.",2
The payment gateway was delayed. We paid thru Paytm and got debited in axis bank one hour later. The payment thru sbi and axis were delayed. Hence pd thru Paytm. Pls revert duplicate charges,2
Before I could say it's a great app but now they charge delivery charge very high.. even though they don't give offer too and if we get offer they collect from delivery charge. I'm a student I stay in hostel before it was okay for me but myself visit to hotel to get the food.,1
Can't suggest edits. Has heaps of restaurants that has been closed for years.,1
"Very poor and taking a very much time for delivery , it will make a high cost no discount available in this app",1
Fantastic. Provides the latest and nearest restaurants with best offers.,5
"I had always a good experience with Zomato but this time I am really disappointed I placed an order with burger Singh and they did not pickup the phone as I was calling them to tell we are allergic to mayonnaise. I also recorded an audio message but still they prepared a wrong order.inspite of requesting them to give the order without mayonnaise, they refused. Now we have been left with no food and my refund status is also unknown.",1
Very high charges.. on hotel menu dish is of 100rs zomato gives rate as 218 and then discounted price as 150rs.. over that it also takes delivery charges. Very pathetic service from zomato.. #banzomato,1
"Its very difficult to reach out customer care as they cannot be contacted over phone from customer side. And the worst thing is that the Customer Support Service is Just for name sake. They are least bothered in resolving the issue of customers genuinely and rather give stereotype replies. And after that Bengaluru incident, we feel a bit insecure.",1
Really a great decision to order this pizza and definitely give it a try at mitron with lovely atmosphere and great songs,5
"Updated review: previously I gave 1 star to Zomato bcoz I wasn't happy with the services but it was the fault of that restaurant not Zomato but as a customer I was angry but today the services of Zomato won my heart, every company gives good services to its customers but this is something beyond the expectations and they also extended my pro membership for 3 months because in lockdown I couldn't use it. Thank you Zomato. Btw I gave 5 star rating first time.",5
"I wish I could give even less rating then this. This app is for our convenience, we are giving money and they should just deliver what we ask for, they should not bother how less or how more we need to order. Sometimes I really don't feel like ordering above 200 but now a days they are forcing. I am uninstalling this app. You are disappointing *Zomato*",1
"Food quality is very good. Wonderful taste , hygenic .Overall good food at reasonable rates.",5
Always provide Very good service . But need to give some discount in delivery service charges during covid war.,4
"Online chat when having trouble with pending order, seemed to work well. Except that, there's no notification sound when the chat came in. Just when you thought the conversation is over, you missed something. The conversation will be closed if you haven't responded within certain time. A little frustrating.",4
Had an amazing experience with my first order even during covid times the delivery was very smooth.,5
Do not install! Worst service! On my first order I received incomplete order and Zomato did not refund the money. I basically paid for the riders meal as well. The experience on Zomato is horrific and the customer care did nothing to help. I strongly suggest that you do not install this app. It's better to go and buy from the restaurant yourself.,1
Very good delivery and food is also awesome ...and timming of delivery is accurate .,5
"I was happy with the zomato orders for a while, but it's been getting worse nowadays, they accepted the order and when the time comes, it says your order is canceled due to some reasons. Totally unacceptable, and the support team says, you will get a promo code, which is useless at the time when we need food at the right time.",1
"Worst service,, even the customer care ppl not responding properly,,, 1 star is also waste for this app..",4
Please elaborate charge while placing order so customer can know what are charges not after order is complete. please improve.,1
"I wanted to order from Merwans and there is no scope of the delivery to my place even if the distance shown was approx 2kms. Ridiculous. Secondly zomato charges much more than the mentioned price, excluding the gst and the delivery charges which spikes the mentioned rate, also the expectations are to tip the delivery guys. For a product of around 250 I end up paying approx 100 more. although the app is good but all these other factors is burdensome.",1
"They will make you order more saying, if you order above a certain amount you will get 40% off. But when you pay there is no option to avail that 40%. I thought, might be while placing the order there would me an option and just presses place order and order just got placed without applying any discount. Cheaters!!!",1
Zomato is the best because their riders are very kind and hardworking. Zomato must appreciate their staff for the hard work they put in place in this hardest weather conditions. Cheers !!,5
Zomato's food ordering services are quite seamless. But the reason I gave it 3 stars is due to the customer care. No one replies to the complaint emails. The message bot is also not much helpful. I had a problem with 2 of my orders in Zomato but not yet got their problem solved.,3
"Tasty foods to eat , but too much costly. I am not saying about the cost of food items ,but for the delivery charges . Too much delivery charges . Even delivery charges are greater than the ordered item price. Sorry ! I have to delete it . I can't waste my money",1
Pathetic support. No issues resolved ever. No liability for extremely late and substandard food deliveries,2
I can see cost differences between restaurant and this app.. In restaurant price is lesser than the online and also charging delivery fee.. We are spending nearly 40 rs/item extra and additional delivery charge..Sometimes you guys are giving offer price that will be same as restaurant price.. I'm really disappointed on the prices,1
"Good for on time delivery,I like ordering in zomato comparing to other food delivering app",5
"The worst customer service you will ever have. Once your order get canceled or have any issues with you order, they will not assist you at all. And you lie about giving you calls to hear about your concerns.",1
"worst service... ordered 2 hours before still mynorder was not delivered. moreover, saying will give you Rs.75 cash back. do hell with this. pathetic service. if you cant deliver on time stop this service",1
"These guys have found a new tactic to increase their revenue. If you go on their app after 5 pm they will put a condition that you have to purchase food of minimum 275INR to get it delivered due to 'high demand'. Now my question is, how come that they have high demand right after 5 pm everyday? They know that most of the orders come post 5pm so let's just increase the minimum amount so that people order food of higher value resulting in more revenue. Honestly, a pathetic way to raise revenue.",1
Even though its the fault of restaurant regarding food issues...zomato always finds a solution to its customers not to be dissatified...the way they treat customers is excellence!!!...but it doesnt give any offers this is the only issue with zomato..😁😁,5
"Update : I have already mentioned the concern. Moreover, I have also written the feedback in the app as well. If Zomato really cares, you should do the needful on own own as there has been feedback at two places. Asking for an email is just trying to brush things off. Original Review : The restaurants are demoting Zomato orders. It's better to orders directly. Have been waiting for my order from Papa Murphy since 1 hour 35 minutes!!! This is possibly the last order.. uninstalling Zomato!",1
Always expensive then real brand app like Domino's or La pino'z when you add any coupen #zomato add 100rs discount but increase the tax amount and delivery charges. When you instant cancel the order it will deduct 75rs and default check donation why we uncheck that? very bad experience :(,1
"Frm rcnt exp, one star is also good for them. They should get ""nill"". I ordered food for my parents but later they wanted me to cancel and order some different food. So i tried to cancel the food but didnot find an option in the app and had to take support chat option to cancel the order. I cancelled my order within 5 mins of my order but they informed me the whole order amount will be charged as cancellation charge, i agreed as i dont have any other option and ask for refund. But dy denied.",1
"A few problems I've noticed of late: 1) Orders get clubbed. But the savings aren't passed on to the customer 2) Time sensitive orders like ice cream and chats shouldn't be clubbed with other orders. Why should the customer pay to get melted/soggy stuff? 3) Minimum bill value & surge pricing scam: we're already paying delivery charges separately. If there are no valets nearby, don't accept the order. Instead why impose more cost to customer? Oh i know, for profit.Better order directly 4m resto",1
I have ordered food yesterday.. Food was raw and the quantity was horrible.. Tried to chat with customer support but no support was providede.... Horrible experience..,1
Ease of payment with saved card and OTP verification for each instance makes it easy and secure,5
Nice app to delivery food at all occassions and meets best app for foodies.. Love it ❤❤❤..,5
"Quite often, the delivery guy's location doesn't update by itself in map view, one has to go out of and then get back into map view to see the updated location. Train your delivery people to rely on their GPS rather than calling us and asking for our location. Also, imho you should have a window of 30s or more for people to cancel accidental orders.",1
Really good application... promo offers are very valid.... fastest delivery partner...,5
"Terrible customer handling. System runs the app, not people. I accidently pressed order and then had to cancel (within 30 seconds) just so I can order an extra item and they disabled my cod for MONTHS. After many prepaid orders when I requested cod to be enabled the answer was that no one in Zomato had the authority to correct the system. Repeated requests were met with blames on the system and helplessness to correct it.",1
Zomato is cut above the rest. It caters max eateries and has a bigger radius for delivering the food.,5
"Offers and discounts to be increased more, now a days, very few discounts/offers happening",4
"This app became worst. Their services are hilarious and moreover they are charging delivery fees and taxes like we all are billionaire. For the delivery from nearest restaurant (which is 10 mins walking distance from my house) they are charging 60-70 INR as delivery fee. Now it is better to go and purchase my food instead of using this service. All the dishe's cost are high, it's ok...but why are you taking high amount taxes then? Uber eats was too good. Now Swiggy became more preferable to me.",2
"Have used the app for years with no issues but the customer service has deteriorated. The food was never delivered and the onus is on the customer to prove that there was no delivery. Without looking at the history, the first comment is we cannot refund - well, nothing was delivered!",1
"They have pro membership cancellation button promising full refund but upon clicking it, it cancels the membership w/o giving any refund initiation confirmation. There is no email notification as well confirming any refund. No where on app or their website there is accessible customer service number listed for redressal of any issues. Unlike their competitors, buying the primium membership (pro) do not give ANY free deliveries even for outlets within 1 km distance.",1
"Used to be a good platform, but now it's a money making hoax. They tie up with weird restaurants that do not adhere to good quality food or packaging for that matter. Everyday I'm forced to complain about something or the other and they deduct their share of profits before making a refund. Be careful with your money on this app.",1
Costly as compared to other apps..very limited offers.. delivery charges are high ..no added benefits of pro user,3
"Ordering food? Yeah it will get the job done. But paying tax and delivery charge damn too expensive than swiggy. And then there is pro membership where you still need to pay for delivery, that's not cool. Ordered for food and items were missing, wrote an email about it got a reply for my complaint saying saying they'll send this feedback to the restaurant. Kidding me? Not worth using it, now I'm a happy swiggy customer with super user membership where I get free delivery and more offers",2
"Beautifully designed app! Making customer pay more by virtue of delivery charges, non acceptance of order below say Rs. 200. Discount offered is either equal or above the tax charged on the item(s) selected for order. Pushes customer to give 5 star rating to delivery guy, does not matter if customer wishes to give or not. Use this as promotional device for delivery system. Rider not available a way to push customer to new restaurants/item where either low quality or their profit margin is high.",1
"They hardly try to address customer concerns on chat or any other way, they just leave the chat in between and forget about the customers intentionally.",1
User friendly app. Polite and quick delivery. Thanks.,5
"First they will make you pay for your order and then after payment they'll say sorry order can't be placed. And yours money is gone for 2-3 days. This same thing happened with me 4-5 times in total, of which twice today.",1
"This app allows us to add items to cart from restaurants which aren't serviceable to my area according to the app. If I am not allowed to order from a restaurant, I should not be allowed to add items from that restaurant to my cart. Its a waste of time when you place items in cart and then realize that the restaurant near me does not deliver to my location. There is no way to know if a restaurant delivers to my location, unless I go to cart. Unless this is fixed, I will mostly use swiggy.",1
There is absolutely zero after service if you face any problems with your food! They will directly tell u to deal directly with the restaurant you ordered from! I ordered at 2 In the night and it was not eatable and there was zero assistance from Zomato! SWIGGY is way better when it comes to after service.. And no I don't want to waste my time writing to your email coz I already had a chat with your agent with zero help and m wasting no more time on your stupid app! Deleting it right away.,1
It took more than 2 hours to deliver an order which has only 30 min delivery time. The valets phone is not reachable and Zomato help chat is not replying to any messages. And in last I didn't get the order. Worst service I have ever seen. Swiggy is much much better than Zomato. Use Zomato if you want to waste your time and money and also want to sleep Hungry.,1
Like what the heck. They don't even have a customer care number. Their chat is just computer generated where bot just stalls you for hours and can't talk to anyone regarding issue with the order.,1
Zomato is no more providing its best service like it used to. Now a days it is just about extra priced menu. A price of 15/- to 50/- is added to each item in the menu. An order which cost me 350/- from the restaurant showed 600/- in Zomato. Along with all the possible delivery charges and taxes. Sometimes the food is packed in plastic bags or newspaper. Switching to Uber Eats and Swiggy.,1
Horrible experience. The customer support person told that the refund amount is initiated since I had a wrong order.now the refund status says credited to account. But I didn't receive the amount. If you are not willing to refund the amount for the wrong order then just tell us that you can't do anything but just don't fool around us saying amount is credited without even initiating the amount. Everyone don't believe the customer service that zamato offers you. It's all fake.,1
"Zomato Unable to deliver orders. After Lockdown starting charging very high TAXES & CHARGES to every order. Rates are higher then Restaurants prices plus high delivery charges. Overall Any item will cost you around 50% more then normal prices. Now due to multi order delivery, Baaasi food delivered every time. Uninstall the App",1
Excellent 👌 experience 🙂 delivery is so fast and we get hot food at our home with 0 charges,5
Great App. Very professional people. Very good service. Fantastic deals.,5
Good service to my place . Always on time. Delivery boys talk smartly and behaves well always.,5
"Customer Care @ Zomato is getting worse with each passing day. No proper response/resolution is provided. Also, sometimes issue won't be acknowledged at all.. If this is how the service is being provided, customers will do get frustrated and switch to other apps and platforms.",1
"Though the app UX has improved overall as well as the service itself, the app has been resorting to dubious claims and false facts to lie about details about the service which users can easily verify. For instance, even after an order arrived 3 minutes after the delivery time mentioned when placing the order, the app claims ""Your order was delivered on time!"" When orders are runnin late, the live map feed claims it is ""ON TIME"". THIS IS SO FAKE OF ZOMATO, lying ONLY WORSENS THE EXPERIENCE.",1
"Stupid app. Doesn't let you clear your cart when the restaurant suddenly decides not to deliver to my area. This is a super technical fault of Zomato. Unable to clear my cart yet for the items placed against the restaurants menu. Talk about progress, development and upgrades. None of these apply for Zomato app unfortunately. How inconvenient and backward can a food delivery app can stoop. Order from Zomato app to feel the disgusting and ripped off feeling that I am experiencing at the moment.",1
"Quite a wonderful app for food connoseiurs. Will match or exceed your expectations unless it's sky high. Good layer of restaurants, easy to order and well a horde of methods to pay, couples with quite easy track and trace in real time. Quick resolutions to most occuring issues and a prompt response although you could not directly reach the customer care. So far so good no serious issues.",5
Terrible app. The app order was different from my selections. Then the chat person said I had to contact the restaurant. The restaurant said I had to go through the app. I will end up with food I didn't order and have to pay for. Will uninstall once I get this order.,1
I have ordered a meal through Zomato and after waiting for almost 3hrs instead of the getting my order I only got a message from Zomato that my order was delivered. But I order was never delivered. Even the delivery guy number was switched off. It was a prepaid order. The chat section was not working. How can anyone complaint about their order. Worst customer service experience. I want my money back.,1
"Too much expensive! First, the prices are already higher than the normal menu of the restaurant and then they will charge you with service tax and delivery charges which makes the food price go even higher..how am i supposed to order! They are creating a monopoly over the prices...feel like they have a cartel. I would suggest in that case use different food ordering apps time to uninstall zomato!!! Too expensive..i will download again when this price issue is solved..bye bye",1
"Always facing delivery issues, sometimes wrong items, some times cold food & some times delayed delivery.",2
"Excellent services provided, food is delivered on time.",5
"This app doesn't anymore deserve even 2 star. I would have given stars in negative if possible that way. Neither the food available is good nor it's price worth. They take so much time, send stupid food items. Sometimes too much spicy sometimes too much salty. And infact sometimes without salt. They would do such things again n again. Hate this app way too much.",1
"I placed an order just to adcb touch points, I followed instructions but just transaction from my card was done and I was not given any option to use touch points. I called the bank and zomato but they didn't solve. I think touch points can not be used in the App as promised. Certainly I will not use this App again. They got my money without my permission",1
The order was not delivered and the Zomato valet is not responding and I chatted with Zomato chat and simply they are saying to wait for 24 hrs.And if you are taking money in that way and not delivering it's very bad of you and you are not even sorting out the problem.its nearly one hour and still both the Zomato executive and Zomato valet are not responding.,1
The service for Zomato was good initially but it really has taken a turn for worse in recent times. I have had incidents where an order was pending for 2 hours and I had to follow up with Zomato to check the status. To compensate they give you a flimsy promo code which does not work and when you report it they give you unacceptable reasons like we are working on your code and will be activated after 48 hours. In a cut throat market of food delivery apps this is unacceptable and unbelievable.,1
"I was happy zomato user, but today's experience was worst. I have 2 addresses in my profile, I chose desired address, chose place on map and placed prepaid order. Its seems system glitch, It was placed at another (2nd address in profile - last used). Immediately within 3-4 min, I connected to zomato support team for order cancellation. Executive asked for new/desired address to make correction/realign order. He assured delivery at 2nd address. Then after order not received nor refund. Lost Rs866",1
Very bad service charged but did not receive did ciz if tech9gkitch still no refund they just took my money very had awful service during these times I have no option if I had I would not use this at all,1
"First time ordered and they just didn't bother to deliver the right thing..."" No chicken piece in a chicken biryani"" and there was no option of refund after I posted pictures and they even reviewed the thing...such bad service was really unexpected",1
"I have order food from zomato more then 50times,Trust me the best app for Online food,I have tried alot of Online food app before don't want to take the name of those app,But didn't get the experience like zomato in any other app,Offers,Delivery time and everything is Best In zomato🤗.",5
Zomato is excellent for food delivery at home step and al members who delivered are well behave,5
"Disgusting app. The delivery fees is too high, even for a kilometer its like 50 bucks! Like seriously? What Zomato is up to? Sometimes the delivery fees is more than the cost of the food. The restaurants are absolutely not cost effective, there are very less or no offers available at all so literally we've to pay the high price, the delivery partners are often late and when we go and complain we are redirected to the feedback section, funny.Wonder how far will you reach with this business.",1
Worst experience. Delivery time mentioned is always incorrect. Its shows 40 minutes but after 2 hours also food doesn't get delivered and then they abruptly cancel the order. Also they don't think of the customer situation as to what will happen if the food is not delivered. If there was negative rating then I would give MINUS 5.,1
I luv to order at zomato.... It's fast n prompt... Even in refunding... No chaos.... Ease at use,5
"Poor, food was in bad condition. Delivery was awful. Removing the app from mobile.",1
"This app has become a rip off scheme, were failed orders are not shown, and repeated orders are never refunded. They don't even have an executive that you can talk to about resolving an issue. They promise you about refunds on the chat but never follows up on the same. Avoid online payments as the commitment of the company stops, the moment the payment is received.",1
zomato service is getting worse. They charge extra for packing but the packing is just a piece of normal paper. Unnecessary delivery surge added anytime which is irrelevant. Also they do not send spoons/forks or straws when required. The customer service is the worst. Money gets debited but the order still does not get placed. The customer care team does not even respond in such cases. The app is also very buggy at times,1
Simply super Very easy to order food we need regular offers to continue with touch,5
Everything we get on our doorstep very easily very much convenient helps to learn about the restaurants services.,5
"They save your card details by default. You don't have the option of not saving the details. Each time you pay by card your details will be saved without your permission; so you have to go to settings and delete your card details manually. Potential for fraud and phishing. Reply: Thank you for your prompt response although I fail to understand why you need me to write you an email. My review is clear enough. Ethically, you should fix the issue. Zomato takes 50% of the tips, I was informed.",1
"Ordered food today using Zomato platform and applied the advertised code for 50% discount. Proceeded to order second time and tried to apply code but got an error. Went back to the first order only to find that i was charged full price. Had the misfortune of chatting with an incompetent, uncouth, insolent and arrogant Prakash who insinuated me for not having applied the code but could not answer why I am seeing an error. I was curtly told that Zomato could not get a senior to look into this nor help me further. This is clearly a new nadir in falling standards of the company- first creating a huge customer base by offering discounts, then selling out data which typically all companies are doing in the digital space; then not even sending their own delivery boys; spiking the list price and then offering artificial discounts, charging delivery fee but not sending their own drivers....and now this blatant day light robbery. I wish Zomato a long painful death ...such is my anger at the fraudulent practice and then the apathy shown. The two things in my 61 years that i have not indulged in nor allowed. Typical middlemen (in Hindi we call such people dallas) who are making money off consumers and restaurants. We do not need them ... it is easy to establish direct relationship and avoid all the lies that are spun by such unscrupulous lot! I will find time and energy to go legal against them...Amen!",1
"Now a days, the prices are going high. The rates of the items in the restaurant are low but it's high in zomato. The coupons are worthless! however they earn 5-10 rupees even when we apply the coupon. Previously, it was good. Day by day, it's becoming worse :(",1
The zomato map is erratic. It always points to a different road other than my location. It is a hassle explaining the delivery guy every time I place an order.However my location shows perfectly in google map as well as swiggy map.,2
"I had been a regular user ordering food atleast twice in a week. But what I have seen in past week, the kind of behaviour Zomato did with their own delivery team it made me uninstall Zomato app till the time you rejoin your employee. I am from Kolkata and very happy with the delivery guys behaviour towards their customers and never found anything annoying. I will even ask my friends n collegues to do the same till you guys don't come to a final conclusion.",1
if there was an option of negative rating i would have given that...i received damaged pizza and asked for refund ..they told me to wait a week ...every 15 days for two months i asked customer service to refund ....they always told me to wait a week more ..its been 3 and half month now ...i received nothing..instead i wasted alot of my time with their poor customer service.,1
"Total waste, utter cheap app. Ordered food from McDonalds and half the food ordered was missing and the remaing food was all burnt with ants crawling over the burgers. Pathetic.. extremely pathetic.. And there is no immediate option to call and give feedback... I would want a refund.. Iam ready to share the pictures... Tip: If you guys are tired and wanna have food delivered through zomato. Trust me you will regret it. Better go and get your own food instead of depending on these cheap app",1
"Zomato service is the best and my review is only for the app. It's not user friendly. When I say user friendly, I'm mostly talking about the people who are not very good with using apps, internet.... For ex, search button for menu is too small & one has to search if using the app for the first time. Imagine using these useful yet confusing options when you are hungry. Please use simple UI and bigger font inside app, highlight important links. We're fine with scrolling down as long as it is clear",2
To be honest the App is good however my experience while ordering something for last 3-4 times was not so good. You order something at 10 pm and the delivery times shows 35 min and the order gets delivered at 11 pm. This happened to me 3-4 times your app fools people it shows order will be delivered in next 11 min and when you Again check after 5 min it shows the same will be delivered in 10 mins and is still in time. Fooling people just because no one is tracking it is not fair enough.,3
It's a perfect app for those who cannot visit the shops also during corona time as it performs all safety measures,5
Unable to order from restaurant right next to me. App is giving tailored experience. Not funny,1
It's becoming worst and worst day by day. No proper help no proper delivery info. You order the food and just wait for hours and hours for the delivery and no one knows how much time it's going to take... One of the worst app ever there should be option of minus rating to this app,1
"This is the worst food delivery app I have ever seen, One thing about Zomato vallets, most of them are good humble. But some of them are very misbehaving, know nothing about location awareness, don't have manners how to talk. And chatting service is also a failure. They just procastinate about why the delivery is getting so late. Overall to summarise Zomato has nothing to do. It's all about goodness of a restaurant and awesomeness of delivery boys, the service you will get.",1
Good app to order food online and i like it more than swiggy. Zomato customer care is always there to help you.,4
"Extremely high Delivery charges, plus they will charge additional Surge charges like Uber. Taking advantage of pandemic, really pathetic. Pro Tip - Search the restaurant on Google and order by call, will be cheaper I can guarantee.",1
. Customer care service is not soo good. Restaurants never follow the instructions. Too much delivery charges.,1
The order tracking is very low standard. Most of the time the timer stuck in a specific time for ages. Restaurants are unable to deliver food on promised time. Very unhappy with zomato.,1
"For me, Zomato has worked well till now. Not giving Five stars because I believe there is always a scope for improvement. Also, just a suggestion that please provide some more offers because some offers don't apply to all. Not everyone can buy the Pro Membership. There are all kinds of foodies in the world.",4
"The services offered by this app is detoriating day by day. Whenever I'm opening a menu of any particular restaurant, instead of the menu it shows me to buy a membership worth Rs.200, plus they charge quiet a large of money in the name of delivery charges even if the restaurant is hardly 500m away from my location. Earlier Zomato was a good app, but currently Swiggy is much better than Zomato.",1
"Their customer service is a comedy show. If I request for any service or a support I may get an answer after 30 mins. Once my query is been attended, I have to explain them again the whole thing. Then we can see their cliche answers and bla bla. Even after all this drama happens, you are not going to get any support from their customer care.",1
"Absolutely smooth and user friendly interface with in depth clarity about the food items and various restaurants in terms of quality , quantity and availability . Proper health and sanitary updates through live tracking and a well organised delivery structure with more or less accurate time management .",4
Repeated insignificance : Had ordered 6 items. Out of which 3 was delivered and one (dal fry) was spilled over the entire order. Even the delivery executive confirmed that the order was not packed in a good manner. And 2 missing items were butter chicken and ghee rice. Moreover the call support executive said that we have provided the refund more than that of excess. Understand we cannot eat our own money at the time of hunger. I would like to get a call from the reporting manager of Mr.Sankalp.,1
"Half the times promocodes don't work, last day I got a reason as to why my promocode didn't work, it was because the food I was ordering was pre-cooked. Ordered from the same place 30 minutes laters, for the same food, magically got the promocode to work, care to explain? Edit 1:- the promo code I got was not from any third part app, it was shown on Zomato.",1
Pathetic that good doesn't have option to give 0 star. 1. I have order my food in 1st Feb. They said your payment has been declined but my bank says it has been deposited in their account. But they keep deny the fact and assure me refund in 4-5 working days. It's been 9 days I haven't got my amount back. their customers service doesn't know how to listen they keep repeating the same thing. The worst app crash several time when you apply coupon or change payment method. already engaged in mail.,1
"No customer care number exists and there is only chat support. In emergency we can not sit and chat. Once you order food from Zomato, don't wait for it, just prepare food by your own as a backup. Because the delivery of food in Zomato is so slow that sometimes the ordered dinner will reach you on the next day of your order date. If you complain customer care about this by chatting they will give a complementary voucher. If you use this voucher, again it takes 1 day to deliver food.",1
For PIN 124010 only low quality dhabba shows delivering to my location. Earlier good restaurants also delivered but now Zomato has stopped their delivery to my location. However these good restaurants are delivering via Zomato to rest of the city. I called these restaurants and they are willing to deliver saying problem is with Zomato itself. Why Zomato??? Are we not entitled for good food??? If you don't want to deliver then don't deliver anything ..why deliver for only low quality dhabba!!,1
Best app.. Fast delivery with safe... Riders are wearing mask and they are very neet and clean.. I love it.. Thank you zomato for an wonderful service..,5
"Convenient. Extremely so. Offers options for every budget. Great membership benefits especially if ordering food regularly. Always a happy experience with customer service in case of disputes. The missing stars are for the pricing system. Each item is priced INR10-30 over the restaurant's original rates, and even up to INR100, in case of expensive restaurants. Plus packaging and delivery charges, and even a 'distance fee' appears in some cases.",3
"Horrible service! Our food was ready but Zomato didn't have a rider. When we tried to contact Zomato, there is no phone number, no landline to reach someone. The Online chat system takes you to a bot or something that keeps on apologizing and asking you to wait. Nothing else. Worse, you cannot cancel the order once it is placed. Our order was finally sent to us after 2 hours. We had guests at home too. We were very embarrassed in front of them. Will never order through Zomato now. Horrible!",1
"Worst app ...new style of money looting ...tried place an order and failed but debited from my account, complained in their support and associate asked me to wait for 10 days,then asked to wait for 5 more days,later another associate replied that they can't refund .I provide all the necessary statements about the transaction. Still he told me he is not authorized. New way of pick pocketing .pls be careful everyone",1
"This delivery app doesn't delivery from nearby restaurants or food chain, instead they charge me distance fee and deliver food from far away resturant which arrives in 1+ hours and is cold af. Even when describing my issue to their support, they simply ignores it and says please enable location, clear caches, add new address, etc. Please this issue is from your side and put some efforts to fix it rather than putting blame on me.",1
"Very good especially in Bangalore.Its way affordable than swiggy. Not everyone can afford swiggy if I hv to eat from outside due to unavoidable situations. Swiggy literally burnt our pocket. Zomato is such a relief for new comers to the city flat is not cooking ready. Pizza...avoid swiggy, u gonna feel the pinch.we shifted recently n unpacking took more than a week n hence food from outside. We never found anything for 2 people at less than 400-500 for one time..",5
"The 'wine shop' section has disappeared from the app for well over 2 months now. Have taken up this issue with zomato care since November, still they haven't resolved it. Every time I follow up, they just come up with a generic reply. I like using Zomato but they are really trying hard to push me towards other options.",1
Taking dilivery charges for food but Zomato delivery expected time 14 minutes is still not updating from last hour almost.,1
"First I need to thank you Mr Jalluri Shabari Nadh, for it kindest and great full service to me , he came from out side of Vijayawada railway station to pf no 7, just for my delivery. On that process he was running Very fast, to catch me with,a helmet on and fully sweat, and his breathing was heavy. I was shocked and offered water , he refused and ran away for another order I guess. this situation was strange to me, why because so many delivery boys not not like Jalluri Shabari Nadh",5
Took 1.5 hours to solve my concern... The reps sends delayed responses and there is no resolution provided.. I am never using Zomato again..,1
Superb eats 😋 And food best for dinner.and Lunch nice 🙂😋 application is interface Is nice I m.already us but zomato is nice offers and discounts.,4
"I would order food everyday and had both swiggy and Zomato pro subscriptions together at a time. However, Zomato customer service is so good, love that one can see actual reviews by others, also like the on time delivery feature, and that the delivery executives follow instructions(no repeated calls for address clarification, leave food outside). Have completely switched over to Zomato. Thank you Zomato for making life so much more convenient. Love from Bangalore.",5
Its an very good app as it have every shop and easy to order and also came in 30 min,5
"Very nice app with lots of offer on foods, snacks,etc.",5
Very fast delivery with favorite hotel picking options and much more love this app,5
"Fake reviews to increase star ratings. Never order anything on Zomato that you want to consume hot. There's a rampant malpractice which o have encountered often. Your rider gets assigned 2-3 orders simultaneously and you'll be shown that the driver is on his way. You will be kept in the dark. No one would choose ordering if they know that in a CoViD scenario, your food is moving around the city. The customer care deliberately keeps you on wait for long to mask the delay. Choose safety NOT zomato",1
"gulaab jamun were like picked up from the street packed in a polythene lassi , again wrapped in polythene like juice and was as liquid as juice sooji halwa , I can get better at anywhere from the street vendor overall order wasn't even worth 60 or 70 rupees where I paid around 170 I wish there was some refund policy or some policy by Zomato to shut down such bogus restaurant my experience is deteriorating day by day on Zomato because of such third class food service",1
Sir when you make a refund the money should actually be refunded... i got the message that the money would reflect within 2 hours and it hasn't reflected yet over night.. and now on the app it is showing that money has been refunded but no money has come to my bank account and you are not connecting me to a agent.. We are not trying to scam are we!? It is a serious issue!,1
"Bad experience food from zomato delivery is bad. Two orders I made, one order had metal piece in food, this order is utterly bad taste with missing items.",1
"Horrible experience. They cancelled my order without any notification. Then they refunded the money as a promo code, not to my bank account or to Zomato wallet. So when I even repeat the same order I won't be able to use any offer code as I would have applied the promo code that was given which means I would have to pay extra than what I did before. Their offers aren't real all the time. They will scam you.",1
"Worst experience, help desk support sucks big time. Even chat bots are useless. Its better to order directly from restaurant, Zomatto put inflated rate. And make fool showing discount and ads. Customer don't hesitate to pay the right amount & delivery charges, however feel bad when cheated. And even i have heard by few restaurant who stopped taking any order from Zomatto due to blackmail & unreasonable demands.",2
Test/ taste unlimited ( though hard on pocket 😉). Never regretted installing it.,5
This app doesn't uses the internet connection while ordering due to which the page doesn't loads and takes too much of time for placing an order.Today i ordered food and received the food after 1.5hours while it was showing 30mins.It took too much time for confirmation from restaurant while the restaurant person are saying that they have not received any order yet.So please see that and improve your services.,4
"Nice app to order your favorite food online, however I would like to advise one thing on service delivery guys, at the time of delivery, they should not tell the stories to customers about how he brought the ordered food, it seems like they want something from customer which is nothing but a tip. Customer willing to give a tip not by force or by convincing with his stories.",4
"Shows Domino's Pizza available for my location in the app and when we place the order, will get the call from Domino's telling that they don't have delivery at this location and cancel the order. Heard from Domino's that they are pushing through zomato app and the delivery is done by Domino's. Can't understand why zomato should allow this confusion to customers.",1
"I ordered through Zomato & the delivery was expected in 25 minutes...when I checked the tracking after 45 minutes it was shwoing food is being prepare,hence I called the hotel for asking how much time it will take..The owner told me that your order is ready from last 25 mins but delivery boy not yet come...when I called the delivery boy he was went to Hindmata Parel instead of Tardeo...He told me to cancel the order...after 1 hr i went to hotel for self pick up...worst staff & don't care abt cus",1
Very bad service. No reply while delaying orders. Forcefully not redunding money. World's worst services. Never order by zomato.,1
Lousy and horrible. After 40+ mins of waiting the live tracking still showed that a delivery guy was not assigned to my order and for 20+ mins the estimated delivery time was 32 mins. I opted for chat with a support executive and she was lousy as well. It took her over 15 mins to assign a delivery guy. No responsibility towards customers.,1
This app is really good zomato delivered all the foods in the proper time i like this app very much this is the best food delevering app,5
"Zomato is a very good app and there is no problem with its service. Whenever I have ordered something from zomato, all food are very tasty and beautiful to look at, so I always think about ordering and ordering other than Zomato. Nobody is better than Zomato. Amazing really good service. Thank you. The specialty restaurant here is Anaya restaurant amazing food very good. Thanku so much ❤️❣️❤️😘😘😘",5
"Hell with your service. You people font have time to serve a customer, repeatedly calling for wrong ordr delivery but the person is keep on disconnecting my chat, or they say transferring to higher manager. If transferring the chat is the job than why the hell you people recruited people for this one. After sharing images also they won't resolve that restaurants people also not responds the call, who is responsible for amount. Hell it is shut ur app",1
Best app with best offers.... It would be better if there are more offers on all the restaurants,5
I ordered my meal and it took about 2 hours to deliver. I called the driver he told me that he received the order just 5 minutes ago when I have been waiting for about 2 hour for it.,1
"Great Platform to order online in this pandemic situation..Lots of hotels recieve order ,but try to collect cash on delivery Zomato",5
Unable to login to the app or on website. 'Something went wrong'?,4
"Very bad experience. The vendor sent wrong product and even after complaining, they are not ready either for refund or exchange",1
"VERY BAD experience today, The order is assigning to zomato valet who is 10 km far from restaurant location. And so my order was not picked up. So I canceled after waiting for 40 mins and again made an order and this too was assigned to a zomato valet who is too far from restaurant location. So today I waited for more than 2 hours. And when I requested to cancel again, zomato was not ready to cancel my order again and forced to accept it. Too BAD.",1
"Their refund procedure is amazing,they always resolve all the issues.",5
Food is good but u didn't mention the quantity of food so if u give discount and u reduce the quantity of food how we will find it,2
"I rated with 1 star but this app didn't deserves even 1 star Very bad experience with zomato, Guys do order from Swiggy it's 1000 times batter then this cheater app, At the time of order you'll see the food will be deliver within 20-30 minutes but it will be take 120 minutes or more than 120 minutes, in this company all are shameless, it's batter uninstall this ghatiya app Everytime same problem I faced I ordered too many times but every time I faced similar problem 😡😡 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎",1
"Zomato chat support is very very poor. I had ordered my food and the food was ready at the restaturant. Restaurant guys called and said that no one from Zomato is coming to collect the order. Zomato says that delivery guy is just reaching in 5 mins, it was 20 minutes and the delivery guy was still not there. Zomato also claimed that due to high number of orders at Restaurant, the food was not ready. Restaurant guy sent me pictures of food being ready. Delays can happen but pls dont LIE!!",1
The customer service should be quickly approachable and easier. A voice suport is definitely mandatory for quick services like Food and beverages and that too when there is an unforeseen issue. zomato app gives u the option to only chat ur concern which is pathetic. Pls imporove ur customer support.,2
"This review is for Zomato and its services, Zomato has a kind of false offering the discount as the cost of food is charged considerably higher than the resturent price, further the target delivery time is very bad, a resturent within 500 mtr, it took 40 min though the resturent made ready the food within 10 min. Plese reconsider the pricing and timing issue.",1
"A really unsatisfactory experience with Zomato.Even if you order a single item costing u around ₹300, they'll ad 150 more stating delivery charges and taxes when the latter already has the taxes and delivery charges imposed on it and don't even think ordering anything costing around ₹100-150 or you'll end up paying like ₹350. I request everyone to move to Swiggy.",1
Coustomer care agent was helpful to resolve the delivery issue. Response was quick and satisfactory,5
"I think now it's time to uninstall this app, I don't write review that often but still here's my review, I started using this app in around 2016-2017 at that time it was pretty useful in a way, but now it got much expensive to think for buying online, all offers are looks like kind of scam to buy more, I can buy momos oustide from market for 30₹, same thing costs me 60₹ on Zomato and only 8pcs, either sellers don't want to sell on Zomato or Zomato policy cause sellers to raise price, so GoodBye",1
Timely delivered and reached correct address without any guidelines.,5
Zomato is being a great help during covid situations. Also the valet members are so good at their jobs. Please continue the same.,5
"Love the notifications.. lol.. food is delivered quickly. Lots of diverse restaurants to choose from. This is the best option if you're ordering delivery. I hate that it increases the rate of all restaurant menu items but can't be helped i guess. I love the.. Delivery in XX minutes or free option, this ensures fast delivery or the food is free.. One more good feature of the app is that it uses Google maps powered location.. This is very accurate to help the delivery agent find your place.",5
"They don't have provision for alternate order if your order delayed by an hr and rider is not reachable to Zomato offical and its night carfew in Mumbai customer cannot get new order due to closing of resturant. All I was asking to arrange an alternate order for me with similar amount that I paid but they said . Plz wait more for rider (who is still not reachable) and if not delivered , we will refund your money ..Rude . I'm deleting this app now .",1
"Service boys are nice around my locality,but very high charges.I ordered a 500 bucks food and they cost me extra 150 bucks.",2
the online ordering help doesnot work at all even after clearing catche and even reinstalling. its been more than 6 months that chat or call option for customer service is not provided. we had several major issues with our previous food ordered but we were not able to contact anyone who could help. our money wasted in vain. and we feel as cheated. worst app as there is no customer care support.,1
"Offers aren't very good, delivery charges too high. Bought Zomato gold membership and the forcefully changed it to Zomato pro. No 1+1 or 2+2 offers anymore (never got to try it either which is why my 1200 got totally wasted) now if you go to a partner restaurant you can only get 10-25% off on the bill which is an absurd offer when compared to Zomato gold. After so many disadvantages they didn't even waive off delivery fees for pro members. Totally regret using the app and buying the membership",1
"Zomato,you cheat customers irrespective of pro member or not.How can you charge a customer for delivering a order after 2 hours stating there is no option for cancellation.Nobody from your side (zomato chatbot, zomato valet) responded for 2 hours after my husband's order and after 2 hours, your customer care executive dials him stating that order can't be cancelled and he won't get a refund for the same.You better use the cheated money for donation rather than asking the customer for the same.",1
This is a nice and handy app. I use it regularly to order food.,4
App was good but nowadays it's getting expensive... before ordering I usually compair prices nd most of the time swiggy charges are way less than Zomato...I don't know why but this happens to me that's Why I'm writing this !,2
"Has one of the worst service. Took an order and said it showed it will deliver in 30 min, took more than 1 hour and reason was there is a dispute with the restaurant and zomato and they completely canceled our order, if you have dispute don't list the restaurant, why does customer have to go though this. And when customer tries to get connected on call zomato executives don't have courtesy to listen properly, cuts the call abruptly.",1
"If anything goes wrong with your order you'll be on your own, or you can spend your time trying to convince their support bot that there is an issue. The bot just gives some standard comments about how sorry it is and how it understands my frustration!!!!",1
"Worst experience ever and always had hard time with the agents. Latest is Mr. Taroon Late delivery and restaurant will take more amount then the ordered. Customer care agent will inform its a mistake and they will return the difference. Why should i pay extra at first point then wait for the difference. Its only AED 2, but the attitude and customer service is extremely bad",1
I found Zomato a very good online food service provider. They are very careful about their customers. My only concern is for Class A & B category towns where they charge delivery fees for each & every order delivery. Whereas in Metro you have the options for free delivery with certain monthly charges.,5
"Very bad service, please don't use Zomato to order food, they don't have any control on restaurants, I order and the TAT was 45 mints but it was more than 1 hour and when I contact zomato they were not ready to cancel the order, finally restaurant confirmed them they don't have delivery Boy to deliver the food than they cancelled after 1 hour 30 mits.",1
"Writings comment is disastrous. It's annoying and frustrating. The review typing cage is placed at the bottom, it's messing up with keyboard. When you have typed a big review, moving the curser up and down is horrible. It scrolls super fast. I tried to select a sentence to cut and paste somewhere else. It took so long, so I just erased and rewrote it. I suggest that you guys make it like a pop up with a full window to type the review. Leaving a small space on the screen is making it difficult.",1
"I have added wrong credit card and I can't remove it from my account so it keeps giving me error whenever i try to pay because it is the default card. I'm pro member and when i used pro chat service, the agent transfered me to robot and no one assist me. It is the worst experience ever",5
"Forgotten promotional coupons cannot be applied post order confirmation. There should be an option to apply coupon in case its forgotten to apply while placing an order for better customer experience Too expensive, tax plus delivery...",1
"It was really good previously, however, now it's becoming the worst food ordering application day by day....worst customer service as the agents abruptly close the chats, moreover, the food delivery time never remains the same just like the estimated time given on the application.",2
"Very good app and easy to order ,easy to get discount Also.👍",5
"Rates are more than what the actual rates at the restaurants are, they think we wont notice, cheaters! Also the ETA time increases for deliveries when we are not noticing and after delivery it tells that they delivered earlier than the eta time, again CHEATERS!",2
I have tried and escalated this many times but it's of no use. some outlets show as doesn't deliver to your location in zomato but when I order through swiggy I get the deliveries from the same store or outlet. There is no point in taking the pro membership when it doesnt deliver to your location. I don't suggest you to opt for pro membership it's waste of your money where you pay for getting discounts and the stores doesn't deliver to your location. zomato customer care is the worst experiance,1
"Zomato rocks n how ! Restaurant selection , dish selection , app experience , discount offers r all awesome !",5
"Zomato has made its benchmark, though there are a plenty of competitors, i believe most of the people will have zomato installed on their phones for sure.",5
"I ordered food yesterday night zomato accepted order but delivery guy told restaurant is closed called restaurant guy said he is home and he will check ,, tried to contact zomato like hell no one is reverting on chat till now ,,and very surprisingly order is marked delivered. and zomato still holds my money for no food",5
The service and the grievance redressal was very poor and un satisfactory. I won't use this app again in life.,1
"Zomato is costly, swiggy is not. Swiggy has a monthly subscription for swiggy super, which is 1000 times much cheaper and better than Zomato pro(same restaurant, same item). Zomato should do something same like swiggy, also minimum order is raised from ₹100 to ₹150. So anyway Zomato is much costly, I will suggest go for swiggy.",1
Improved application Interface and Innovative payment options made me love ordering food on Zomato.,5
"Thesedays there is some or the other problem with every single order. I order regularly but mostly there is some problem, sometime they send food completely spilled out in the packet, sometime they send me burnt spoiled food, yesterday they said the order is delivered but I never got it and Zomato says they don't have any control on a order I placed on there app.",1
"Good app. But few issues: 1. They can have tip feature but should remove the dramatic appeal that their riders put their lives at risk to serve customers and hence should be tipped. It's ridiculous as it's a profitable business and everyone in the chain makes money. 2. Need to be reasonable. Almost every menu item cost is inflated as we get it 10-20% cheaper at the same restaurants. Plus they charge delivery fee which is anywhere between 8-14% of bill value. Add taxes, and it's further inflated",4
"I have observed Zomato increased the price of items hugely. For example, a certain pizza which I supposed to buy around Rs. 200 from a particular outlet ( and the outlet is still charging the same), Zomato price is coming after 'so called"" discount Rs. 276. I naturally placed order directly to the outlet and save my money. I will be hesitant now to order in Zomato hereon",1
"You guys better update your payment system, i ordered twice bcoz the payment failed for you and the amount deducted. Now you will say its the issue with my payment app. Thats not a good excuse. It happened many times now. Bcoz of this the restaurant took the money for free. I cancelled the order, they said it is already prepared within a minute. When thats wasnt even a valet yet to pick the order. Just bcoz of your mistake they took the money for free. Its not about the money, but its too bad.",1
Fantastic service just have to give offer and made free delivery on regular orders. Thanks Zomato,5
"This is very amazing but they take very high rate of delivery charge....,....",5
"Unhappy with the single click feature and the glitch in the app while ordering which automatically checked out item in the cart while I was just building my cart. There is no option to cancel order if placed by mistake. Even if you call the restaurant or Zomato within 5 seconds to cancel the order , they won't cancel it and will give a lame excuse that order is prepared.. I mean comeon how can order be prepared in 5 seconds. So I'm uninstalling this app today, in order to not face loss in future",1
"My order just got cancelled and I was charged the cancellation fee because the delivery guy could not contact me over the phone. I didn't even get any call from him and of course, he could have asked in the neighborhood for help. However, after a long chat session, I got the refund.",1
Zomato is my favourite food delivery app amongst all till date. Hope they'll keep providing their awesome services in future also.,5
"Had placed order through zomato. Realizing mistake in order, placed specific request through app as well as spoke with restaurant through delivery boy. Despite confirming change, restaurant sent a wrong order. Tried calling restaurant on the number given on app, but the same is not operational. Spoke to zomato customer care and rather than solving the issue, they simply said they cannot give refund neither replace order. Would prefer to use other delivery app rather than zomato.",1
"Good food delivery services but not easy friendly on cancellation of order. This happened multiple times due to unsafe resturant, by mistake due to same name. The time we cancel it's too late and customer service not so helpful. Please improve adding cancel button with limited time for 1 or 2min. Fake delivery time.",2
"Horrible experience.. When I ordered my food it showed me it would take thirty minutes to arrive.. When I tried again 10 minutes later to see where the location of my food was, it showed me 34 minutes left... What the hell is this Zomato.. no body wants free food but atleast showing the exact time when I'll get that..",1
There is no support available where or if the delivered item is not proper and non eatable condition,1
"I downloaded it 6 to 7 times, but it isn't opening in my phone. Even i tried on another it did worked, but not responding in mine. Had done all possible actions i can do, but nothing holds my hand. This is seriously the most annoying thing i had faced. Please try to fix it.",1
I loved the zomato app at first compare to other delivery apps. But after the second lockdown Zomato gotten worst,2
"Started using the app since few months and visited couple of same restaurant, were the price differs more than we expect.. The high in price compared to restaurant.. Really taking taking 40 to 50 bucks for each dish... It's better to visit the shop and eat.. If ur really in need to after the high in price please go ahead... Definitely it's high price app were the offers and coupon do not value bcz of high price...",3
"""In time or free"" is the biggest cheating zomato does. I've been complaining on a regular basis, but they blatantly say, ""this is how we are and we shall try to maintain our integrity from next time."" It is ridiculous. But app for usage is good.",1
Terrible is an understatement for the service provided. It's like I'm chatting with a robot and no resolution given apart from automated responses. I was charged twice however after several follow up I only received automated replies but not my money back. Never using the app again,1
"all the restaurants have wrong delivery time mentioned on the app. I guess Zomato doesn't verify that. I never received my orders in the stipulated time frame, which is really annoying.",1
"Pathric service provider. Never ever received any sort of response from Zomato chat, ever Zomato helpline number. Rubbish services. Facing same issue couple of times in a month.",1
Thrice my refunds haven't been completed now... the app shows that the money has been refunded but till date I haven't got any money. Tried every method of contacting them... through the app then mailed them for consecutively 3-4 days but still the response I received is that they are looking into the matter. Being such a widely used app such behavior is really disheartening.,2
"It's midnight while I am posting this review. I has made an order from Fasoos via Zomato an hour before. As displayed on screen, the food should have been delivered by 30 min approx. It's more than an hour now. And instead of delivering food, Zomato is providing me with promo coupons worth my purchase amount. It's too pathetic of zomato to think so. I am left with no option but to sleep hungry.",1
Order placed without my ok did not give me a chance to review ... I need delayed delivery at 8 pm. I need to pay on line I have to apply the promocode. Instead of being helpful they are charging 50 for order cancelation,1
"You guys don't acknowledge your mistakes and it happened so many times. I ordered something and you delivered a totally different food. The chat support executive also doesn't help and blames it on the customer. And when I told them about their mistakes then you guys disabled my chat support, even when I am a pro member. This is really dissapointing. Now I can't even report their mistakes to them and accept whatever they deliver and whatever mistakes they do. You cannot silence my voice.",1
The customer support just knows to apologize and show sympathy without solution. The delivery boys are not provided with proper delivery vehicles neither they can read English. There's no telephonic support to discuss you concerns. Only chat support with limitations. Very bad service. This time I have raised my issue and I want my refund back for the order.,1
Use interface is very nice offers are also superb It depends upon resto only hiw the food is,3
"Fast, Easy, Contactless. Just exactly what we need as per present scenario.",4
This app fulfills my order and delivers it on time.The quality of the product is good.,5
Issue with delivery . Night delivery has extra charge but experience with it is not good . It took much longer than expected time . Also the expected delivery time was very High because delivery boy was on bicycle .I appreciate to use bicycle for delivery but there is no point using it late night .. people order late night because they need it on priority . Bike would have delivered my order much earlier as there isn't any traffic at late night delivery .I could have atleast received it bit warm,2
"in swiggy , when we type the food in the search bar and click the search option , it only shows up the names and pictures of the food , which is really good , but the zomato instead of showing up the food , only shows the restaurants , which means we have to go through every restaurants in the app , to find our food , which is really tiring . so , i hope zomato to do the same with the next update , because it will really help the customers , search the food , lot easier .",1
attractive discounts and offers as well as quality food with good packing,5
very depressing a lot of orders are getting cancelled for stupid reasons. Refund will be done with in 5 to 7 days. Now neither do I have the money nor the food. GREAT!! AND this happened twice in the same week.,4
Best food app. Clears all the query that has been raised by customers.,5
I have been using zomato from a long time and very often. Its interface is realy easy to use and effective and the staff you guys select is also very well behaved and so is one of your staff Kamaraj from Karnataka. Its a very humble request to please look into the matter quickly and give him back his job. He is realy an innocent guy and hardworking too or you guys will loose a very good staff member. Whole India supports kamaraj help him guys. Take strict action against that psycho girl.,3
It's a good application in the sense that it offers the widest variety of optiins. But sometimes I feel they are too inclined to provide cheap food rather than a great digital ordering experience. The app had not been engaging me a lot recently. I wish something more could be done in terms of user experience.,4
"Had an issue with the order, raised query twice but havent received any call from CS. They charge extra money for delivery but they are not ready to takeup the issues raised by customers... Switch to Swiggy or use local delivery services. Dear Zomato, Please dont tell me to raise a query in reply back to this review. I already did that and wasted my time.",1
"Zomato should include cancellation option. In case I place my order and it's taking way too long for say 2+ hours then there is no point in having that food. But unfortunately poor customer service and unsatisfactory resolution at times is making me uninstall this app and switch to swiggy only, although it's bit expensive but it's better than to face poor experience.",1
I had sufficient amount in my wallet. I was still at the stage of finalizing the order but the money was deducted from my wallet without my knowledge. No chance or time was given to me to review my order. Can anyone from Zomato explain to me this phenomenon. It's really bad and not at all acceptable. Waiting for response from Zomato.,2
It's the worst app and service ever and I ordered from Domino's and they said it will be delivered in 28mins but its since 1 and half hour it's still not delivered and the support agent is also not responding so it's the worst app you can download and waste ur money,1
"There is no proper customer care. It has a dumb, chat bot support system. If your orders are missing then, there is no proper way of communicating with the customer care and getting it resolved.",1
"Waste of money,it's better to order directly to the restaurant and ask for door delivery comparing to restaurant price and Zomato price there is a difference and adding delivery charges from the customers, many restaurants are giving good discounts for home delivery also and not on time delivery, delivery boys are also not wearing mask bag and Tshirts also, so better to buy direct from the restaurant so that the food will be be good and hot.",1
Very nice app for food ordering. It provides many offers too.,4
The app is lagging . The location is not proper and it takes time to open up .,3
Very Good app and Excellent Service. Really good offers also and must have app.,5
Worst experience with there worst service ...we didn't get what we order ... the diverery boy dilivered the incomplete meal of what we actually ordered.... one ate of tandoorichicken was missing... we chateted with the service desk they were so rude ... we dn't even get the amt refund nor the food ... pls check ur food before the deliveryboy leaves.,1
Directly placing order without OTP ???? How we will cone to know about this type of transaction Make the app little more user friendly Provide OTP confirmation before placing the order Disppointed,1
"Rated this app 4 stars earlier.. But it seems you have gotten worse as you've grown.. Orders arrive 30-40 mins later than shown while ordering.. Every time I talk to a delivery guy, they have like 2-3 orders at the same time.. Really disappointed. Also, the cost of food on Zomato is higher than what it is for walk-in at the same place.",2
Very poor service as they give multiple orders to the delivery boy and gave us wrong message that food is under preparation,1
Incredible service and consistency is still maintained just like its initial stage,5
"Swiggy is much better than zomato. Food takes minimum 50 minutes to deliver, while the app tries to trick you by not updating the current time. and Most of resturant are offline and the delivery time is never accurate and the delivery charges are absurd . Plus the new update on the app makes the UI very bad.",1
My friend Hena had ordered from WOW Momos and instead of non veg she has received veg momos. After spending 2 1/2 hours chatting with the customer support the issue was unresolved. Same thing has been repeated on the email also when the issue is raised through email. I would like other people to know that the company is not concerned about the customer services at all.,1
Pathetic service by Zomato team. Food picked up by valets after that they don't move to your direction and suddenly @ 10:15 pm support team informs due to service issues valet cannot deliver food. This has happened 3-4 times with me. All dinner orders. Refund is not the solution. People are waiting for food at night and giving 100 voucher is not the solution. Taking ownership is the issue. This feedback is for Kolkata.,1
Very prompt delivery and good service over all nice experience in such a time of distree these people are doing a fabulous job keep it up👍,5
"accurate location to be updated properly. many restaurants put heavy charges on delivery when offer is added. Customer service is worse. Everything is good as long as you are lucky to get the food as expected, else no issue resolution or refund.",3
"Whatever happened to the thumb rule of hospitality “ the guest is always right “. Tried placing an order on Zomato as was famished, tired and drained out by the heat. Unfortunately for ME, I did not have a smaller denomination note in my pocket than a 2000/- rs note after a long wait the rider answered and following is the conversation that followed 👎. U decide. As for me I have deleted this app and going to get this across to as many ppl as possible.",1
I love this app. This app never waste my time while it's loading it tells about a fun fact. The offers are amazing.It deliver food lighting fast. The costumer service is very good just click the photo of food and it to them if your food it's not good they will refund your money back. The Riders are friendly and they wear masks and gloves.,5
Try to improve the delivery speed of some restaurant they are really making the order tooo late .... and just making fool the customer about that they having the worst problem,1
Everything is good except the offers they are giving. I've ordered food using a cashback promocode. At first they said cashback will be credited to your payment wallet which was used for payment. And then after two days of conversation with their executives they credited the cashback of Rs.75/- as Zomato credits and said to use within 30 days. What my question is how could I use 75/- in Zomato? What should I order for Rs.75/-? Just tell me guys.🤔,2
The support team is not helpful! They have an escalation desk for namesake who wastes time with the same info!,1
"Horrible service, delivery always late and staff is least helpful to resolve issues. Prices are higher then the actual restaurant prices. Better to call restaurant directly and order there instead of ordering on zomato.",1
This app doesn't even deserve -1 rating Customer service is very poor. In my last order some of the items were missing and some were wrongly delivered (I ordered something but got something else) and I complaint about the matter all I got was a promo code that too not of sufficient amount to compensate my loss. I don't don't want your god damn promo code keep it I want REFUND!!! I'm uninstalling the app right now.,1
Very poor customer support. Multiple incidents with incorrect orders delivery and no support afterwards. Switch to Swiggy. Chat assistant is least interested to solve your problem. Have raised the ticket on email response. Let's see if someone bothers to solve. Ticket ID - 7417668.,1
"Good app and more options are available in the app for customer satisfaction, which is the good thing, this app is perfectly suits to customer and customer can manage manny things for itself related to order, but this app has some limitations also for which i gave four stars to this app that the applied offers are shown invalid when we apply it we are under all rules and regulations but instead the shown offer was not exist some time, instead all is good.",4
After ordering zomato shows their timer in app very slow to claim delivery on time instead of late.,2
"Just had a bad experience with the delivery order no 14140 75518, The box was not taped and the food spilled out other and the paper bag. The delivery boy delivered the order to my office boy and he is not responding correctly. I can't take the food. If try to complaint on the chat box, they are giving 200 rs off. Order is 400 rs and can't eat the food, but they giving 200 rs off on next order. Worst service and rood behavior from the delivery person.",1
"The app has been useful but their customer service sucks. They just keep stalling you giving you false claims. I would have given a 4or 5 stars but regarding their customer service thats very poor and for which giving a one star, thats also the minimum requirement otherwise 1 star s way iver for their service.",1
"It's a nice app offering great discounts, despite of the fact that sometimes my food is spilled outside the box,,, I don't blame Zomato or the delivery boy for same, the delivery is fast and convenient.... ✌️ Today tha package was spilled.... but I didn't bothered much and just made Zomato aware about the same, they were asking for the pic but I didn't had any as I was enjoying my meal at the same time,,, and maybe after proper verification they allowed 50% refund of that particular order.",5
"Zomato has been a good service provider, but now there costomer care is not upto mark , they are trying to cheat and instead of providing refund they are offering promo codes with are not even usefull. They are asking to use our money as promo . Them what is the use of giving refund as promo.",1
"The delivery charges are outrageous! The app itself is lovely. The tracking feature is really good. Wished the Pro membership included free delivery like Amazon Prime does. I would have undoubtedly upgraded if Pro members got free delivery. Otherwise, the benefits appear to be quite insignificant.",2
"Prices are rediculas, it's higher than the restaurant prices and quantity is too lesser than the restaurant standard.",3
"I had given a great review for the app earlier. But now I want to highlight a problem with the service. You guys are doing a wrong thing with the ""Multi-order"" allocation on a single valet. The order gets delayed, the food quality deteriorates. The food gets cold. Please stop sending multiple orders to your valets. The service earlier was better.",3
"Extremely overpriced items listed at prices above MRP. a 500ml Pepsi bottle, with MRP ₹30 is listed at ₹60 and then they pretend to give discounts on total such that the bottle still sells at prices above MRP. Its a scam. Transparency is the key to customer reliance. Every customer should be ready to pay provided the pricing is transparent and real. The moment one starts hiding, faking, misleading, that's when we lose trust in a brand.",1
Refunds are not a solution... On time In full is what you need to be aiming for !!,1
"This is a good app to use... Never faced issues till date... With pro account or even without pro facility, u get lots of offers... Quick delivery with all required precautions by delivery people... In case of any issue customer care team helps u on immediate basis to resolve...",5
Very disappointed for the extra charge you apply on food. Charges are more than the discount price. Few months back I order 1 dish from Zomato and it cost me for 144rs and now same dish cost me for 200rs and also you apply minimum order value on some hotels. I have pro membership as well but no use of that atleast you should give free delivery to pro members. That's why now I prefer Swiggy because their charges are very less and they provide nice discount as well,1
"Highly manipulative App, always charges high delivery fee and pricing is always more than what restaurants actual food cost. Unnecessary surge charges, some times not giving option of the favourite or regular food hangout place",1
"Worst service, don't use! 'Customer care' shud be called 'we don't care'! Team doesn't listen to customer's grievance & gives random computer generated replies. I have emailed my concern to suggested email ID but it has been closed without resolutn. Your team is oblivious to customer's situation & issue & throws random responses as if I were talking to a machine. Every order in last 3mnth delayed. I call delivery & restaurants for 1.5-2hr only to realize that order may be cancelled. Headache!!",1
Having great food eversince started using Zomato. The Zomato pro experience is also amazing. Great job guys! 🤸😉,5
"Food prices are inflated. Got better deal when I directly contacted the restaurants. Even after applying fancy discount offers, the final price is way over the usual restaurant charges. There is no proper packaging. Uninstalling the app.",1
"Very very pathetic customer service by Zomato. I ordered food at 11:30 PM on 27th March. Estimated order time was 30 mins, they made me wait for a whopping 90 mins! And then shamelessly cancelled the order. You can't even get a proper customer care response as they don't have people to attend to your queries. Hope your company rots in hell",1
"Have faced same issue today, it's worst with zomoto. The delivery agent is too worst and chat support is too too too worst it's all automaticalle reply from them. There is no call support. I have ordered a dish at 9.15 and i got delivery at 10.44, so i cancelled the order and trying to reach customer care. its a worst customer service i have seen ever.",1
I am not able to use app in android version 5.0. There many crashes in my mobile.,1
"I appeal to all user please don't use this fraud app because they don't have the value of customer's time. They assigne multiple order to valet and the listed those restaurant who takes 2 hour for food prepration, if I want cancel due to time taken they did charge for this.",1
Delivery agent always gets confused with the location. If i call him then his very rude and unprofessional for Pune location. This happened two times. He is not even ready to listen to instructions on how to come to destination. Apps like swiggy offer better delivery service and their delivery agents are also good. The come to my house without any instructions #uninstallzomato,1
It is useless to order on zomato particularly when u are hungry on the late hours. There delivery persons don't even knock d door or gate when mobile no is not reachable due to network problem. They put false pictures of food hanging on the gate but actually nothing kept on the gate. False pictures provided.,1
Lot of price difference between the actual menu and delivery menu. They just loot you,1
The order was late approx 2 hours .and I am writing the email to Mr. Depender goel of CEO Zomato...with the recording and your non-sence reply. My food was late approx 2 hour. Refund my immedeatly ..I didn't receive my food I am also mentioned that 1st you mentioned me your list fake customer and to see and analysis my situations my food is cancelled because your Zomato service don't provide any agent services delayed my food more than 2 -3 the order was late approx 2 hours .and i am writing t,1
I am referring to the ultimate savings bucket ordered from KFC. Including taxes the ordered item is 599. By the time it reached me from Zomoto it become 760 . Why do you increase the price in the app when you are charging the service charges and taxes. At last felt that going to the outlet is lot lot lot better than ordering from Zomoto. Food doesn't taste like it is in the outlet and I am ending up paying more for less quantity. Charging is not an issue but the soft drink quantity is reduced.,3
What is wrong with the app? None of the restaurants are delivering since 3 days!,1
Nice app i like this app but in night one day i am oder from anandam ir is not taking any payment method epct net banking so in giving 4 stars,4
"Only one word to describe experience ""worst"". I remember back in 2019 Zomato is the best app for my daily cravings. I almost order atleast one time via Zomato. But I don't know what has happened to Zomato. Customer support is turning from bad to worst. Delivery services are moving to worst. And on top of that most of the restaurants showing false prices (price listed on Zomato is hell lot more than the actual price listed on restaurant menu). Hope Zomato take some action ilon these issues.",1
Very poor service. They club your order with others customer in same restaurant. So you have to wait for others order to be ready before your order is picked up and take more than an hour. It will be faster to go yourself and pick the order,1
User friendly with wide range of options and timely offers as per seasons.,5
Great app! love how you can search what food you want to eat and you literally get soo many options. we have found our favourite restaurants from here. The only issue is that some places you get charged more on the app in comparison to dine in.,3
Not satisfied 😕 Earlier the service was good but from few days i am getting worst customer support for packaging related queries,2
"Zomato had no costumer care for complaints, if there was any problems with our order, zomato and the ordered restaurant was not responsive, that's why sometimes the restaurant people are wantedly doing some mistakes if we ordered in Zomato. Because they know there is no complaints or cashback are there for the wrong or mistake orders in Zomato. If you are placing an order in Swiggy, that same restaurant people will be take care of our orders carefully, because they had strong customer care.",1
"This was a very good app until recently from last 2 months I when u order the food I receive it from uber eats. What!? Why!? And the food quantity is surprisingly small, like I contacted the restaurant and they told me that 1 plate should contains atleast 13 pieces and I recieved only 4. It has become disgusting now... Very poor.",1
Hunger will become anger Worst app not opening toooo much time taking to log in or any other activities don't download waste of time.,1
I liked the fast delivery and only problem is with the money heavy amount is taking for normal tiffins and Biryani points,5
"Hi friends, don't add tips in app for the delivery boys, it's said that in zomato and swiggy, the tips added by us in app is not full paid to them. Example, if u add Rs. 30 only rs. 15 will be paid to the delivery boys .So if u wish, give the money to them in hands while they deliver the food. Thank u all..",5
This app is not how it was before in Mangalore. The food price is way too high. One starter cost almost double the amount than in the restaurant. No one meal option for pro. Pro literally rips a hole in your pocket. Though the delivery was so far good here in Mangalore,2
The most unspeakable quality control. valet numbers are cooked up and not contactable. 2 hour delay today but they wouldnt even release the order so i could not use a better service. Extended period for banking transactions to go through. be prepared to wait 10 times as long as swiggy.,1
Timely delivery and offers on all great food what more can you ask with good UI too,5
"Awesome experience, its really fast, Gokd, and safe service, I really loved it🙏",5
"The two stars r literally just for the app, otherwise would have given a zero.. Zomato giving offers is literally a joke. Like who adds 80-100 rs just as tax and delivery charges. I had rather starve or go to the outlet by myself rather thn ordering. Also the new thing, where a offer or coupon is only applied when its a prepaid order, is very disappointing.. So its the time to break up with this app.",2
"There are very cheap experience in this app,, I suggest to all that they don't use this app. They are cheat people money in online payment, they had 2 times to do with me, and aftrthat they send a fake msg that your money was refunded, they start new cheat fund co. Through zomato.",1
Really loved it best app more better than swiggy always completed their work on time⌚ ⌚ there is not any problem in thise app while using 😁😃,5
Nice Very easy to order food and deliver the food within the time,5
Worst experience ever .... Order for just an ice-cream from and don't know why it was not delivered in time .... The app is totally slow functional .... Not at all easy to use .... The order cancelled was not even compensate,1
Overall zomato is good but it take responsibility with all of restaurants which customers ordered that should be deliver!,4
This happened to me yesterday. I placed a order from restaurant close to me and as soon as I hit place order I realised that I had selected wrong delivery address. I tried to immediately cancel the order but no option to do so...no option to modify my order....I started chatting with support. And she said you collect the order from adress that has been selected nothing can be done as the new address is not in 3-5kms range of selected address so can't be modified. This is ridiculous.,1
Third class order delivery app. Zomato never look after the delivery partners. It's just getting benefits of unemployment of India and just sucking bloods of poor delivery partners and grabbing money of people ordering here. Zomato aap showing repeatedly to tip their delivery partners. But Zomato is grabbing money from customers and restaurants as well.,1
Warst app firstly fix ur bugs my payment was successfully done but it's showing payment filed.,1
"Food delivered was not as per order. I cannot chat and ask with pic. Whats the point of sending mail again if my order cannot be fixed and I have to place new order? how's it going to solve my immediate hunger? My above review is from 2019. Event today, situation is same! Same restaurants when ordered from swiggy don't give any problems. No min order, delivery fee is also less. Soon might have to choose to use only swiggy!",1
"Highly disappointed... Although sometimes they do provide us with the food which Swiggy is unable to deliver during certain hours but in some cases when I want to pay extra for the charges and would like the food from my favourite restaurant, they seem to just place a message unable to deliver to your area...i better stick to swiggy rather than ordering from here..",1
"Zomato apparently now gives riders multi orders. Every time I have ordered from Zomato, the order takes around 2 hours to reach me. Even if the restaurant is 10 mins away from my house. Horrible experiences that has made me decide that I'm never ordering food from Zomato again. Swiggy is lightyears ahead when it comes to service and being on time.",1
"Totally unprofessional service. Delivery executive are behaving rude and day by day your services are getting worst. Always there are delays in order and when complain about that they respond that it will never happen again. Guys switch to Swiggy, they are providing better services and in very polite way. Trust me, I am with Zomato from last 5-6 years, but it's time to quit the association. Negative rating..",1
"The worst service ever. Am gonna uninstall right away, again ordered from dominos and the order was cancelled by them. I haven't received any refund. You should shame on urself. Taking money from customers without service. The cheat app. Cheat team. If you are unable to resolve the issues then shut the business. Don't make people fool.",1
"Fast delivary and tasty food , actually some restúrant give a best offer , really verry useful app",5
The customer support is really worst....I have been trying to contact the customer service from past 3 days. But i have not had any sort of live chat or call service from the Zomato service. I was asked to write a mail but I was not replied. It is really worst and I didn't expect this from Zomato.,1
poor quality food at night. no body can eat. same price but at night food quality is very bad.,1
"Very excellent service I like zomato online food delivery, I never cancel my order because, before I ordere I take enough of time to choose what food I need to eat from which restaurant. That's all.",5
This is the 2nd service availed in the last three days.. and the service provided today was exceptionally great. Thank you 😊,5
"Its the most easiest app for food ordering. I find swiggy very complicated in terms of which restaurant is closed or open at the time of ordering. As it shows everything & when u actually checkout ""all of a sudden a message pops the restaurant was closed"" .Where as in zomato they only show what is available with discounts & rest those who are closed r shown in grey colour. On zomato they show full food menu offered by the restaurant whereas in swiggy u will find limited food options in the menu.",4
"Avoid Zomato.....Don't Order from Zomato, ever! Many of their delivery partners are just plain cheaters....in my case the delivery boy returned without even trying to contact me for the reasons only known to me. I have call records that he has never contacted me and in the process I lost my money. One can order directly from restaurants. Shame less, their customer service executives answer like bots... U will never be heard....",1
"Great experience, but still delivery charges exist even in pro membership",5
"This app is very good but there is only one disappointed thing that If there is offer of 80%,70%, or 90% they will less only 100 rupee on your order They are pretending like they are giving us a huge offer 😡😡",3
They mentioned an offer that they will refund 200 if delivered beyond 35 mins late. But when I placed order they did not accept at all and cancelled it. As time starts when they accept order. Stupid business tactics they do. Badly wanting for another better app to come and beat zomato.😫😫. Need uninstall this. Even I called hotel and asked they did not cancel. Zomato has wantedly cancelled it,2
"It's not worth even single star. The app doesn't let you order from a lot of restaurants. When the rain starts they increase the rates many folds, delivery charges were skyrocketed and minimum order price drastically increased. Not worth it",1
"Very Good Application for last minute lunch,dinner and breakfast order.",3
"If you place multiple orders on a day, and have issues in more than 1 orders, then the app doesn't allow you to report. It just doesn't give you the option to type your concern. Also I have noticed that there are too many issues with zomato delivery off late.",1
"I had an issue with my order. The app has taken same order for twice. And money got deducted twice. I tried to cancel the duplicate order, but I didn't get the full refund. This is the issue with the order and payment. Unable to do anything because of no customer care.",1
"By far I have not had any problems with the service, and has been on time with the deliveries",5
"Well for starters your timer is bullcrap... delays are not notified nor updated to the timer ... it keeps on giving the same ETA even though the delay is huge... my order while I'm typing this review down has been showing me ""on time"" ETA of 13 mins which has been the same for more than 15 mins now . Great work with your App",1
"We both ordered the Classic breakfast with coffee to follow. The weak coffee arrived first in two distinctly differently sized mugs. Not a good start. My over-easy eggs were grossly over-cooked. My wife did not get the mushrooms I ordered. Our toast, white bread with no options for wholemeal or sourdough, was soft and underdone. On the plus side the hash browns were fine as were the tomatoes and bacon. Overall a disappointment considering the location on Geelong's waterfront.",2
why delivery charges are applied whereas the ads don't show/ reveal such info plus they don't give the location of the restaurant before ordering... secondly like other food apps they should display the food images along with the price.... this app is more expensive than swiggy.... zomato loots.... very bad.,1
Good and fastest delivery . Customer service is good. 👍,5
Very Bad m refund is still not initiated it's being almost 25 days now & every time when I raise my concern people told me it will credited into your account 3-4 business days I guess it's lockdown for Zomato that's why they don't have business days.... Very Disappointed.....Zero customer satisfaction....Please make a note of it.... Owner of Zomato........,1
"1.When your money get stuck, it will take 4 to 5 days to reflect into your bank account and you won't even get a compensation 2. No customer care service.. Only via chat and first we have to chat with stupid bots to raise the issue 3. They take to long to respond in chat box 4. Zomato price is higher than the actual hotel menu 5. No matter how clear you typed you adress, delivery person will always ask you the route details again",1
"Good app, WRONG map instructions. And thats in poshest of Delhi where nothing was built for years. Lajpat nagar 3.",3
i used your app regularly and never had an issue. But after i changed my phone to realme its all different. It's not showing meals for one. And recently it is not even showing the photos. I can only see one photo in each restaurant. Hope you correct it.,4
First 3 times I got problem with riders ... Waste app for food delivery .... Most of the cases I got this experience,1
Loved it earlier and had only been using Zomato for every food delivery however extremely disappointed and disgusted with the fact that neither Zomato cares for their users nor the restaurant. Placed an order mentioning clear instructions for Jain food however was provided regular/ non jain food. When raised this concern in chat support- Mr. Mohd simply kept apologizing and didnt assist at all. He neither spoke with restaurant nor gave me refund. UNINSTALLING APP RIGHT AWAY,1
"Outrageous customer service. They don't even respond in the chat and as there is no option to call customer service we have keep begging for them to respond and resolve the issue. I would suggest swiggy good at customer service and atleast better responding. I would suggest not order cause issues keep happening with humans and you feel outrageous if nobody is there to resolve, believe me they don't even reply you sometimes.",1
It's such a waste app I didn't got my refund it's been more then two weeks they don't even have customer care support so I m writing it here hope they see. They have deducted my money for an order on 9th March but the order was cancelled by the restaurant nd a refund initiated but I haven't got my money back I have written several emails nd feedback no response from there end is received i stringly recommend plzz don't I repeat don't trust this app many like me is struggling to get their money,1
Waste app dont use it they have provided me with food which is spilled . There automated customer support gives same replies for every question . such a bad experince. swiggy is more better than this,1
Have changed my rating 5 to 1 star. So much mess now in this app. Have to close and open again and again to track order and have analyse maximum no. Of reviews are fake in some new open restaurants. I have personally gone to so many reviewer profile who have many followers or just 1 and 2 and they are just fooling other peoples. Please before ordering go through the reviewer profile too you can have a lil idea atleast that those are fake review or real & Cust. Executive r now no more supportive.,1
Zomato charges more money than the original menu of restaurants plus taxes and a hell lot of other charges. If u want a hands on experience go to your nearest MacDonald in Zomato and select a burger or 2. Macdonalds rates are inclusive in the amount charged yet Zomato will charge u 33 rs for delivery and in addition also charge you around 50-55 rs tax. I don't know what this tax is for but it's ridiculous. It's asking to pay almost 80-90 rs more than the final bill.,2
"It was 5 stars, until this update. Please bring back the feature which can sort by rating based on location that set on it. In this update i can only chose whether sort by distance / rating, so sometimes when i click by rating and already set my location it will still shows all sub district food places. For real case: when i am in a mall i see bunch of food seller, and i was really helpful with this app cuz i set the mall location, click see all food in that location and sort them by rating.",2
My most preferred and ease application for food delivery. Awesome,5
Delivered too late. After getting late there is no option to cancel. You have to accept the order in any case. Otherwise you full money will be charged as cancelation charge. Very bad services.,1
"Worst Than The Worst... Don't use this app... The worst service. That won't check what the order is and even don't have a solution with them if anything went wrong. They will send your money as refund and will tell that we had initiated your money atleast your money is not wasted. I ordered pure veg from ApniThali which is in Sector51, Noida. They sent me egg curryvwhixh was left with them. No contact number was provided to reach them for situations like this.",1
"Dusgusting. This app has always been bad, but they decided to make it even worse. You used to be able to contact someone if there was problems with orders, they've replaced that with a bot. S horrifically bad bot, seemingly designed by an imbecile. Avoid this app.",1
Never order from Zomato..they will lots of rupees for delivery charge and will never deliver on time..also the delivery person will be assigned multiple orders and even if your food is ready..it might take up to hours to delivered to you..and then you enjoy the cold food.. uninstalling this app.,1
Its good but showing many offer but there are no cupons to apply need to check this off% feature,4
Bad experience with Zomato. I have been using the app for 6 years and now I am totally disappointed with their services and Domino's. May you need to change your policies with Domino's so that customers don't have to suffer getting refunds. It's been 4 days since my order got cancelled by Domino's and neither Zomato nor Domino's has taken any effort to resolve the issue. Never ordering from here again,1
"Good app, nice service, also good discounts are offered.",5
Worst service...chat support is of no use. If Google comes up with negative rating then for sure I would have given it to this app.,1
"Even though ordering with Zomato is easy, it takes lot of time to order.",4
Better of all Food Delivery app previous but not 10/04/2021 time losing app not working properly..,3
Amazing service by Zomato..All the people who work so hard in late nights also. Thank you for all ur help you make us smile even in late nights by delivering food.,4
Timely delivery and offers are good and price also reasonable and value for money and I tell refer my friend to order food in zomato,5
Zomato should see that if the valet has some problems like bike not working etc then after a period of time they should assign that order to some other valet automatically rather than making the customer wait for indefinite time. This should be automatic and not based on request and support call a customer goes through.,3
"The refund procedure for delayed delivery of food is worthless...instead of transferring the refund amount in our wallet,you are only giving a promocode but that was also I knew from the customer chat and when I knew it after it got expired.What a worthless service.Atleast notify us in our mail id or text us so that we can utilise the so called refund.",3
"DISGUSTINGLY MORE EXPENSIVE !! Its absolutely useless to order from Zomato now, better to order directly with the restaurant, as their prices always exceed the price we can get by dialling the restaurant / vendor - ZOMATO not only charges almost ₹ 40 delivery charges, but they also levy a tax figure on the services which almost tantamounts to baout ₹ 100 or so extra for choosing Zomato. It used to be good and worth it earlier but post pandemic they aren't being fair to their customers, it seems.",1
The app itself is easy to use however since Talabat has bought Zomato in the UAE their service has deteroated. The driver's don't have any location presence or knowledge whatsoever. EVERY SINGLE time I order food the driver is absolutely clueless about my location. Above that when I try to explain them the location they don't seem to comprehend or understand my directions probably because they gave not been trained properly. I have written to their customer service team several times on this.,2
Usually I find small differences in price when compared to other food delivery apps like swiggy and have found zomato is mostly costly. But today found that a particular food item was costlier by 22 rupees in comparison to swiggy which is a huge difference and totally unacceptable. Planning on switching over to swiggy in the future.,3
Customer service Representative have come up with new lines. Write the feedback on restaurant page. I received a small quantity and that too the box was not filled completely. Their Reps are no help at all,1
"It doesn't work properly app closes automatically and items from the cart are lost... please fix it and advice ""Make the with low animation and don't put High contrast colours just keep it simple""",1
"I used to love zomato and regularly order from their Meals for One category. One fine day after updating the app, the category itself ia not reflecting. Also, your delivery charges are skyrocketing day by day. I can see delivery charges reaching upto rs 70 for an order! Please bring back the Meals for One category as it would help normal people.",3
Excellent Service till date ...Looking forward for more better service and offer,5
"Unreasonable delay And no support. even if there is unreasonable delay which delivery boy accepts, Zomato will not allow you to cancel. For cancellation, they will charge you exorbitantaly High.. मरता क्या ना करता, you can't cancel and even can't wait... Add to it, number of delivery boy will suddenly go unreachable.",1
High Price on Zomato compared to restaurant bill also zomato is charging Delivery . Zomato Pro subscription is just name only . Zomato giving discount on increased price . So thats nothing . People are wasting money . Well planed fraud business by Deepender Goyal. Go to hell Zomato. Kicking out your app from my mobile .,1
"Very bad app... Always block COD. and having lot of problem... Which they never solve. And cannot contact the costomer service. And if we get connected somehow., the donot solve the problem give many excuse, and let it go attitude.. I have a lot of bad experience with zomato.",1
I create new account but I don't able to apply any promo code.i email customer care many times but no solution. Worst customer service provide by Zomato.😡,1
"Never again ordering from Zomato ,I ordered my food but it's been a more than 1 hour still the food is being prepared and the live tracking system shows the same 8 minutes and does not work till the food is prepared then the Zomato valet arrives out for delivery the live tracking system works then.never ordering again and deleting the app",1
Internationally charging extra from customers.... delivery charges and taxes....can anyone explain if restaurant doesn't take tax then why zomato... posting pictures When ordering from official website price is 283 When ordering frim zomato price is 374. Huge difference,1
"Stupid app, can't chat with their representative and dead slow riders.",1
Good . Why people say that the delivery is not good. U have a choice of hand to hand delivery or contact less delivery. Very satisfied by the delivery and easy-to-use. But sometimes the app glitches and the products fluctuate . Others are very good😃,4
"They don't let you cancel your order, Ridiculous with support and extremely delayed delivery. This is not upto the mark.",5
"So much delay in delivery. Customer support reverted they are helpless. What a customer experience? Do Zomato cares for customer experience? Yes, they will proudly convey that they have provided you Rs 25 credit as for them it is cost of customer experience. Order with Zomato if you feel happy to get Rs 25 credit and just forgot about your food.",2
I love zomato.. the only issue i have is sometimes while updating the currently serving restaurant the application shows everything offline and also it would have been great help if we could choose food from multiple restaurant with one go.,4
Awesome restaurant with a soothing ambience. Excellent seating arrangements. Food served is of high quality with an irresistible taste. The Service is also professional and up to the mark. Dishes served at an affordable price. A very suitable place for dining with friends and family. Amazing place,5
Cheap app. They have little concern. No grievance portal also to lodge a complaint. An order which was to be delivered within 35 on a non busy day and that too the hotel was also waiting for the order to be picked up. The zomato agent turned up after 1 hour. I am sorry this poor business.,1
poor search and item display/ description experience. promotion codes doesn't work! Apart from finding dish -- The description for the dishes is not sufficient in most of the cases. And the addition of potato/egg in the dish like biriyani should be very easy and intuitive. Biriyani without potato and egg is really not satisfying. Your responsibility can't be only to provide the platform to connect the customer and the restaurant --- try to lean from Amazon like services.,2
Pathetic service. My friends in Delhi also complaining about how their food never reaches or delayed beyond patience.,1
Reachable service in all cities which is very brilliant for foodies.,5
Very good app. Easy to use. Excellent offers and discounts too,5
One of the best food delivery service provided by Zomato which delivers in maximum locations which other providers such as Swiggy doesn't provide.,5
"Pathetic app. Every time i order food from zomato, i have to wait for 50-60 minutes.",1
"I had placed an order through zomato ,the delivery agent number is switched off & i kept waiting after 45min also I didn't get any notification,so i raised an complaint in zomato for the refund ,but they haven't refunded yet, if you place an order immediately they will take money , If you cancel means the refund will be doubtfull ,HERE I DIDN'T GET THE FOOD NOR THE REFUND ,Kindly uninstall the app ,THEY ARE FRAUDS",1
Customer support is very poor. Please take pictures of evey food items you receive otherwise they will not support you. You can not easily contact with customer care service.,1
"Just uninstalling this app and logout already after being using it since launching due to customer service i faced in my last 2 orders. Just wanna give update, i contact them as they requested but even the customer service looks the same horrible experience. Just trying to show people by reply that they care.",1
"Editing my review to 1 star. I bought pro membership for 300rs and guess what they jave reduced offers, over cahrging on the actual prices of items. I visited the restaurant personally to check the prices and zomato is actually charging more than restaurant prices plus delivery charge of 30-50 rs per delivery. If we are paying the delivery valets, why are they called zomato valets? They should be called public funded valets. You have lost a valuable customer, wasted tons of money on pro.",1
👎👎High charges even after Zomato pro membership. They will double the actual price than give you max 80 or 50-60 rs off. Do check actual price of menu and order directly from resturant on free service - Food price in Zomato hi much Higher than restuarant actual menu price(more than 30%) - After having High price they will take delivery charges (Rs. 60) + food packing (Rs. 30+) + taxes(around 5%) - example Rs 129 pasta from.dominos you will endup to get around 200+,1
"This rating is for service purpose of Zomato, that's why Swiggy is best and Zomato is worst. Also requesting all to do not put your orders in Zomato. If you have enough time like 2-3 hrs to accept your orders then it's okay. After that their customer executive give you rupees back to your next order when you were suffering from hunger. I don't need money. Is there any value of time and hunger? Improve your service, otherwise please leave that business and sell raw fish like street vendors.",1
"very poor In promising the timing of delivery. 3 times they delay my food , my last order was taken 2 hour ,every time I ask about my order they will say within 15 mints u will receive your order ,thats nonsense. it's about food ,not items to receive. times can wait for even 1 day .but when u r hungry u can't wait. TALABAT MUCH BETTER THEN THEM ,NEVER HAVE ANY ISSUE .",1
I ordered 2 double egg rolls with addon - 2 Lime Soda (Rs132 total) for me and my cousin. I received simple/plain Soda instead of Lime soda and it ruined my complete meal because we wanted to eat our egg roll with Lime Soda. Which is totally unsatisfying. Refund was lower than the incorrect items. Totally unsatisfying and corrupt system.,1
"I was going to order and it was 9pm and when I went to checkout it showed only prepaid order above 350 and I then had to ask my brother and all.It was so frustrating that last minute in the cart and then "" pre paid order only"" creep up😠 You guys can show it up before that prepaid order from this restaurant.I got really annoyed",3
"I was a regular customer of Zomato since 2020,and i found hotel are selling the food items with big margin, and these Zomato doesn't have any Control over it. And we need to pay delivery charges extra nearly 20 Rs extra, that means these Zomato is giving chance to hotels to squeeze the customer pockets, as they like, please don't support them.because the Zomato doesn't have any methods to regulate the price of food items from the hotels or restaurants.",1
This is best for order food and it is very simple.,4
"It's really annoying nowadays. High packaging charges,+ charging 60₹ to 80₹ delivery charges after that I had talk with delivery person he said Zomato pays only 15₹ to 25₹ per order. Next is low quality of food & high prices. And last one is in my locatlity no nearby restaurants available to order from. Always shows restaurants very far from locality. F*+k you Zomato.",1
I had ordered a pizza from dominos using zomato last week. I had only some amount of money left which I used to order my dinner. But even after one and a half hour I didn't receive my order and when I checked it showed that the order is delivered. After that moment it's been a week now I have been chasing zomato for my resolutions but received nothing. They are only saying within 2 days I will get my refund...but even after a week they are not taking any action against it. Horrible experience,1
It's getting worse day by day .. somany glitches ... No coupon codes applied .. horrible absolutely horrible,1
"Bad and lousy app..... Very very slow , Please improve your app, if is very slow , it took 45 minutes to order",1
I would say Zomato has really improved its services Also giving importance to customers complaints Great work keep it up,5
"The food is not delivered but the status says it is delivered. Tried to reach out the delivery agent but he is not picking the call and rejecting it. Even if he answers by mistake talking in unknown language. Totally disappointed with it, but I would really appreciate the immediate response from the team Zomato. Team Zomato has refunded the amount but money is not matters always, it is the starving for the food and waste of time.",1
Delivery was too late it taking minimum 35 minutes for order confirming Very disappointed with this services👎👎👎👎,1
The App shows the restraunts which are open as offline. The help desk won't resolve your problem rather it will ask you for forgiveness by taking every mistake they make as an exception. Almost on every second order there will be either food spillage as well as late delivery. Worst !!,1
It is too much theif company app. If Resturant selling food in Rs. 50 then they show in them's app 150 and in cart they add more taxs just like 50 or more. Then we get our food in 200 Rs. Which original cost is Rs. 50. And this is not finish here.. If shop is selling in rs. 50 then the shop owner sell to zomato in just Rs. 30 or 35. Now you can inagine how they are theift from us. I can understand that every company is thinking about giving service in just a part of amount but this not a part.,1
Worst customer care there agents sounds so robotic hey cannot speak or type great just robotic messages and they do not resolve your concern just keep you hanging without any resolution or answer. therr menu is so confusing for the orders it' says two different thing when you order they will be like voila cook your food darling who needs Zomato If I have to cook my own food and customer services agent are so so useless. Worst pathetic.,1
"It's happened before, the app doesn't allow one to delete previously stored address & doesn't select active location When I escalated this issue to the team, I was promised change in address & delivery of food as Zomato believes in not wasting food which I acquiescence despite it was a pre- made dessert for which I could have cancelled the order & placed a new one.. it's a shame to be addressed with bot & later with a staff who after spending 20 minutes wanted to transfer the query to an expert",1
The dark mode could be better but overall customer experience is nice.,4
The delivery charges of Zomato is too high compared to Swiggy. Also the rates on menu card are inflated from the actual menu card prices at restaurants. Eg. A 150₹ biryani at restaurant will be shown as ₹250 at zomato Aap. Then you get a 50% discount i.e. max 100₹ and then will charge you ₹55 for delivery. So overall cost is 205₹ . So actually there is no diacount and you end up paying more. They fool you in short,1
"Worst app I hve ever seen..delivery charges are too high..if u choose hotel nearby only still its charging high price of delivery..for ex. If I order cheese dosa that cost 70 rs, if I order that, I need to pay 70 rs delivery charges means the dost cost u arund 140..even hotel owner also said dont order from zomato instead order directly from hotel...I u r staying far then u can choose this option but before that need to contact hotel whether they deliver or not..",1
"Really poor service, it has happened to me twice that it's shown that my order has been delivered but I wouldn't have received my order. I then waste my time trying to track it and by the time I initiate refund it becomes too late.",1
Very good service and offers providing to customers even in this pandemic situation of Covid-19....really very happy from your services...all the best....,5
"Not good delivery. They take hell of a time to deliver even for a distance as short as 500mts. Looks like day by day they are increasing their delivery charges. Earlier max used to br around 35-40, but now it has reached 60. Lockdown recoveries..😜 You have not refunded me Rs.177 in my order even after 4 days. Whereas the mesaat you sent clearly says within two hours amount would be refunded. And now yuor useless chat service says pls drop a mail .. we will look into. Pathetic!! Useless",1
"These days Zomato is assigning multiple pick ups and deliveries to the riders without even checking if the orders are ready for pickup resulting in late and cold food deliveries. No option to give bad rating for Zomato for such extremely poor planning except for rider rating which would be unjustified for them. Poorest customer care. Last time I contacted, all I received in response from Zomato customer care executive was a "".""",1
Service is excellent with comparision to swigy and uber I am rating after using regularly for three years.,5
"This feels cheating when the same dish on zomato is costlier than the original restaurant's price. Delivery charges are too high. Zomato Gold is a Scam if you are ordering for yourself only. Customer service is also not satisfactory. Also Too Many Restrictionns like can not order below 400. This Surge, That Surge. Frustrating. Swiggy is much better as of now.",1
My favorite thing about zomato is when the delivery person just disappears with your food. Your order could be an hour pass the delivery time and zomato still won't fix it. You have to contact them? Why? They know the order is late. Horrible experiences with all food delivery apps here in India. Much better experiences in other parts of the world I have traveled in.,1
"I accidentally places my order, and opted for cancellation within 5-7min. Even then they charged 50 cancellation",1
Worst experience we faced. Food is not deliver and we asked on chat to contact us and chat person saying only is saying that we can only available for chat. No is responsible. We are waiting for food and food is not delivered at all and it's irresponsible from zomato side,1
Just avoid this app. Their service is worst. I got my order after 1 hour 55 minutes for a 3 Km delivery on Friday morning. The customer care is good for nothing. So I am quitting their app. Restaurants should also leave as Zamato socks them. Restaurant delivery is worst. But Customer care could have refunded money. STAY AWAY FROM zamato and Aryas restaurant.,1
"Food quality is good and also the app experience is great. Only problem i could tell is zomato should keep the city dynamics in view while showing restaurants avlbl for delivery. Eg for a resident residing in Malad it shows the andheri restaurants, so theoretically its only 10kms but in mumbai traffic just the one way journey might take 50 mins , and approx 90 mins to and fro for delivery guy. Now if the delivery gets whatever small amt he gets for 2 hrs. Its bound to cause frustration",4
The chat agent are not at all ttrained on how to handle the conflict. We pay in advance to get the food and when we don't get what we ordered they don't even do anything about the same. Worst experience .will never use the service again. And if you keep doing this then one day no one will order from you people.,1
Pleased with simplicity to order and prompt service as well.,5
Good App with clear visibility and prompt service with affordable charges,5
Yes this is a bad app. Because if we ordered something there is no option to cancel that order. So that's why I don't like this app,1
"The only issue I had was with the limitation on Cash on delivery on a single order. If the minimum rate on ""cash on delivery"" could be increased to at least Rs. 500/-, it would have been great.",4
"It is good but not happy with the direction. whenever I choose the location, then everytime it shows the wrong and the longest one to reach the location. That's why 4 stars.",4
"Nice app and service. But won't it make more sense if when one clicks on ""History"", the actual order history would be shown by default instead of showing ""favorite"" by default and then the user having to click on another ""history"" within the ""History"" on the bottom navbar?",4
"Being a PRO/GOLD customer, I have waited for 2 hour for my order, after that my order got auto canceled. This is very unprofessional service, if there is any problem atleast inform your customer. And please resolve issues in reasonable time period. Pathetic experience. Won't renew my pro subscription again.",1
"Most recommended place for all the sushi lover. From first bite to sushi, all flavour melts together.",5
"Payment option is horrible, pay on delivery is not an option above 500 rupees and card payment is failing every single time",1
"Worst experience.. Pissed of with the customer support executive too...You can't trust this App fully. "" I didn't get my order (Dinner) even after 2 hours, when I tried to reach the customer executive they took half an hour just to confirm that order has been cancelled. But in Zomato app it is still showing order is reaching u soon.""",1
Really awesome to have food at door step even on complete lockdown during pandemic.. Lovely service,5
"Nice app. Almost all the restuarant are nearby and pretty quick delivery. Just had some editing that, even though app is useful, sometime restaurant don't deliver on time or cancel the order just because it was prepaid order and not cash on delivery. This should be rectified and also delivery guys should not make any excuses for not delivering or etc.",5
Too much delivery charge. On the way you are delivering multiple orders n charging too much.,1
"The aap and the chat facility for help is too slow and the response from the agent is very very slow while chating, and the reason for that they say is one individual is handling multiple chats . The food took longer than it was committed and when I aksed about it , Zomato just simply apologize and as a bribe they added 25₹ to my Zomato account, do you think we ( customer s) are so greedy that you can delay the order and give these credit points always just to shut our mouth n don't complaint.",1
Worst experience with zomato. Money has been deducted from my bank account. But order was not placed. Unable to contact you guys through app since the chat option is not working at all. No customer service??? Worst app ever.. Highly irritated .... Don't know how am I gonna get my money back..,1
"Worst Pricing to Promotions Model. Most of the restaurants giving 50% discount, hace double of their original menu prices, are faking Promotions. There is no check on this by Zomato. Normally any establishment who wish to run a promotional campaign register it with govt to ensure fare play. But Zomato is failing in it and ultimately it is a bad credit to thwor account.",1
"I have been using zomato since 2019 . Everytime i order @after 11pm (whenever i pay online),The delivery boy don't deliver the order and he/she switch off the phone and just vanish. Usually i complain about the problem and they sometime repeat the order or refund me. For like 3-4 days i slept without having dinner . Today i saw a video that one girl has been hitted BECAUSE she complained for not getting delivery in time . Really.. zomato is fkg crazy. Delivery boys/girls are fkg crazyy",1
I had ordered one pizaa and after 45 mnuts Zomato boy called me and told me like your order is not ready due to not avaibility of vegetables 😂...it was so shocking statement.....and when I chat with Zomato person they were insisting me to wait for more some time to make it clear......as people are waiting at my please for the food since last one hour.......not acceptable,1
"Most of the time, I've been served with low quality, less quantity and high priced food and even when complained about the issue, Zomato has never taken the necessary action and they try to convince customers, rather than giving the much needed and strict instructions to the restaurants and Zomato thinks they will still have a customer base even with poor quality of foods. Useless Zomato and Swiggy. Don't cheat people.",1
I loved the experience of Zomato it take the fast order and delivery is also best 🥰,5
Everyday have to reset the address so many times untill it starts showing the restaurant can deliver to my address !! It's soo annoying even after setting the address you add food in your cart and again I have to go through the address issue ! Tax and delivery is always over Rs.80 which is just big rip off!,1
"Price is hyped for no reason. Around 12-3 pm, the food prices are extremely high. Although your service is good, as a customer I feel it's unreasonable to pay almost double for the food as compared to the dining rates of restaurant.",1
"Today I ordered food through Zomato. The food was not matching safety standards.There was spillage in the packing and even there were worms in the food.when contacted Zomato for resolution,all I could hear was ""please consider this as an exception..we would surely improve in next delivery"". Worst experience with Zomato....doesn't deserve even a single star.",1
Delivery fees are increasing dramatically every passing day. Plus the prices of dishes differ as listed on the app and if you buy it directly from restaurant. So basically I'm paying a premium to the restaurant and Zomato for delivery by using your app. Plus many times it happens that total price comes lower on Swiggy.,4
Regardless of restaurant experiences... This is by far the best online food ordering app.,5
This app doesn't show the exact time when the food is going to reach.,1
"Okay. Nothing great. Needs to also have an option of scheduling a delivery, say if you know you have a party planned on a particular day and you need to order in advance.",3
Awesome.... During pandemic also doing great job...hatsoff..wonderful service...amazing app...,5
Bad experience... Valet given wrong order and restaurants don't accept the order placed by customers for 40 mins..,2
"The order was worth Rs.157.5/- (after discount), not sure why would Zomato charge me Rs.207/-. Rs.50/- as their charges even though the place of delivery is just a kilometre away. Quite a ripoff on Zomato's part. Unacceptable, totally. I'd rather use services of other delivery partners. Not cribbing about 50 bucks, but sheer illogical business practices.",2
I placed an order and items were missing from it. I complained to the outlet and they were so rude. I complained to zomato executive and she didn't take any action. Worst services. Worst support. Terrible food. And no it's not the first time. It happens almost every time. Infact it's rare to get good food from zomato. I am so disappointed in your services. Hate you!,1
"Great service in Pandamic condition, हॅट्स off to All delivery boys Flaw less service and fast delivery",5
Good food delivery app but sometimes you should understand that refund is not the solution. Hunger can't be calculated in money. So next time please ask the person whether they want food or refund.,4
"Bad customer service and support. Incomplete meal was delivered by Zomato and they don't even want to take the ownership of the same. There is no customer care support number. Only way is to message them which takes over 15 minutes to be attended by someone. Further, the executive has the guts to say that the restaurant is unresponsive and there is nothing that he can do. Even the representative don't not have the power to refund the amount for the non deliver of the items.",1
App is good but customer care is not helpfull had an issue with my order they havent even refunded such worse customer service,2
"It is great always except one large order on 14th February, food was too bad and we had to make alternative makeshift at home for our family and friends . Samosas were good. I hope that we will have continue to enjoy your quick and dependable service experience.",4
"If you have ordered food from zomato and by chance you get some quality issue , burnt and something like that then be assured that your money is now wasted because there are no customer care services in zomato after some orders. They provide service agent for chat only in starting after some time there are no option for chatting after all this they provide email option which one never works. They asked to solve issue in 48 hours. I'm thankful to zomato that more than 4 days left and no answer .",1
Great service. Very good delivery men. Timely delivery. 💥,5
Initially very good. Then non supportive. Even my order has been missing and stolen by delivery agent. Not fully refunded for wrong orders sent . No customer care number only chat. After making soo many complaints only apologies nothing more lost my money on wrong order sent. Zomato does not care for customer loss. Bad really bad,1
"One of the worst customer support ever. I lost money placing orders. Their zomato valets will switch off phones & will never deliver orders. When we try to chat with customer support they are having high inflow & ask us to mail the issue. When I'm having a wrong order or items missing in order or order was never received, they ask it to mail them & they will revert back in 24-48hrs. When an issue needs immediate resolution, who will wait for 24-48hrs?. Dont waste money placing order from here.",1
Poor delivery experience and hopeless executive on chat support. 30 min for one query answer not even resolution,1
The app is very much useful to order. Whenever and wherever,5
Though delivery agents are well behaved and prompt the delivery time mentioned is always wrong!! It shows less time and when you place order the time is increased. Also the food arriving in time differs from actual time (it'll show arriving in 5 mins for 10mins) be truthful with the time Zomato every one is on the clock.,3
Zomato delivery is excellent 👌 But the restaurant (amigos in nellore ap) delays the order nearly one hour,3
"Zoomato is one of the best app to order food. Lots of options to choose from, many locations, delivery almost everywhere, no minimum order limit, delivery on time, order tracking, great customer support, riders are neat and take care of food, riders park bikes in proper place, the food came is fresh and hot as if it came direct from kitchen. I have used other services and I want to endorse zomato service 5 star 🌟 among all.",5
"The order is declined, still not refunded from more than a week .",5
Good. It was my first order through Zomato. It reached before expected. So I'm happy with my first experience with Zomato.,4
Most of popular restaurant now not accepting orders. Surge charge demotivate us to order online. Bad management. Some restaurants are not delivering orders in good area. Fix it.,1
"Dining history takes excessive time to load ! Moreover if you are pro member then you have to go in particular section of dining to pay via Zomato pro. Worst thing is after spending 900-1000 rs on purchasing pro , cafe deny services and when contact to customer care they ask you to wait for 15-20 mins so that they can checkout the problem with cafe and then ask for more time ! Making it nearly useless to buy zomato",4
Very commendable in food delivery. Very fast and smooth.,4
"Multiple charges for a simple delivery, expensive and poor strategy.",2
"You pay around 200 for one and you can't get sufficient food. If you raise complain about they just say we will improve but they will never improve, i have noticed from last couple of months. Very worst service.",1
Food quality very poor. Order not received complete. Packing of order very bad & without seal. Not recommend to anyone.,1
Order tracking is not at all good. It takes long time to refresh the map. This can be rectified with at most possible way and this would be of great help if done correctly. Look into this matter ASAP,2
Works great in locating the address and qyick hassle free deliveries.,5
"Not recommendable app. Use Talabat instead. Customer service of this app. Is totally 0% empathy, listening skills and problem solving skills. They keep blaming restaurant fault but it's there mistake. They will not even bother to solve it. They will just call you for formalities and apologies with no solutions. I will not use this app anymore.",1
Very good app for foodies and very good at tracking the orders,5
"The response from the application is very Low but the pricing is very good. I would still think twice before ordering, mainly because the app is slow to respond and hangs frequently.",4
"To be honest I had problems with Zamato in the past but I have given them another chance and have to admit they're currently the best food delivery app in India. Im pleased with the way they're doing things, like often guaranteeing the meal to arrive on time or they reimburse you with credit. Zamato gets better and better as Swiggy gets worse and worse. I USED to be a swiggy guy but not anymore. You earned the 5⭐ this time 🙂",5
I never get the option of Cash on Delivery in this app whereas Swiggy and many more apps have it enabled. Really unsatisfied and disappointed.,2
Great app.... But please try to give orders on expected time.,5
Zomato delivery takes a whole lot of time to order the food. It takes nearly 60 to 70 mins to deliver food. People order food when they are hungry and need food to be delivered as fast as possible but till the food arrives the hunger becomes extreme. Zomato should deliver quick.,2
Nice and reasonable prices of dishes and charges..... Superb performance,5
"A wonderful app. I have been ordering since last 3-4 years. Just faced one issue recently while ordering, there were two restaurant with the same name and without location being mentioned on the order page. Which resulted in the order from wrong place. I immediately realised that and requested cancellation within a minute of the order for which I was charged cancellation of 50 rupees. So disappointed.",4
"in New version it's not showing total reviews at the restaurant menu, user have to go to ""more info_reviews"" to see total reviews. come on UX guys. app consumes too much data. i can't even see the menu of restaurent but my data usage shows 8megabits/s.",1
"kindly improve your ui, it is very difficult to place order and navigate hotel.",1
"I rarely give app reviews but I stopped for Zomato. The app is at its best now in UI, UX and stability. Props to the dev team and everyone. Albeit, Refunds to OPM are a hit-or-miss. Only a few restaurants offer refunds to OPM while most of them go to wallet. It'd be great if we always had the option to select either wallet/OPM. The pro mem says no min order value, not true though. The surge charge thing is quite often and negates the any discount coupon so -1☆. Else it's a no frills experience.",4
"Basically, they don't regulate anything, there are no standards, no bar. I received my piping hot order in a cheap thin plastic bag, as thin as a blown baloon and when I complained they told me they're sorry and they will not do anything about it. They don't care about hygiene or health, they just wnat to sell and create revenue.",1
"One of the worst service providers, although I'm paying an extra on 100 rupees on the entire order they still allot a second order to be picked up for the same delivery guy. I feel it's better to go myself and pick the order. This happened multiple time with Zomato where as swiggy never does this. I feel Zomato should get poor sales because of the worst customer experience that it provides",1
"Worst experience with Zomato. As soon as the order was placed and the valet was assigned, I called him to give the exact address and to whom to handover but the delivery guy put the order at a roadside and marked it as delivered and the number as not reachable. When I tried calling the delivery boy he is not answering to my calls. And worst part is Zomato is not providing an option to chat with their customer care to take this up with management. All they tell is to call the valet. I feel cheate",1
"Good Customer Service, Easy to Use, Well Polite and Mannered Delivery Boys.",5
"I 3. Added voice note to not to confuse in address and gave correct note because as per my previous experience google map picks.automatically some wrong address which is not near to me. 4. Rider started from cycle and after many minutes when I called him, he said he is on some other address by you App. And can't deliver to my add",1
"Earlier I used to be a Fan of Zomato Service but now a days what I have observed is they're looting in several manner. For eg. I've Just ordered a sweet from nearby Sweet shop (1 km). The cost of that sweet is 360 Rs./ Kg but they're charging 550 Rs./Kg , there after delivery charge and Tax makes it to 580 Rs.++. That's really awful to see how they are looting customers. I hope they'll take this concern seriously and work upon their policies.",2
During payment it showed error in payment so I retried payment...but when I see my orders it booked my order twice..when i called hotel they said cancel it with customer care...within 30 seconds i tried to cancel my second order they deducted 150 rs by saying you wasted food prepared...Very bad customer care.,1
"Delivering speed is perfect, but There is no cancell option to avoid any problem",3
Good food delivery app with fast delivery and taking all safety mesures.,5
Worst none of the agents are available to talk or resolve issues. They are hopeless. Please be careful before ordering. No contact number nothing is available of the restaurants even if it is there it's wrong.,1
"Selection of rider is very bad....rider is from long location from hotel and also not aware of customer location . System shows order delivered though order is not delivered. Hotel person n riders dont show apology about late delivery n blame on system. Very bad experience ...my order is placed at 9:00 pm, still i didnt receive order.",1
Adding donations to Bill without even asking!! I know it's a small amount but anything added to Bill should be asked and not just added.,1
the chat support is worst of the worst. i had problem with my order and i complaint about it in chat support but they replied me back after many hours saying that sorry for the delay we hope your problem is solved by now. how can you hope that problem is solved automatically. please improve your chat support system.,3
"Never make a pre paid order here, Never trust Zomato (the online cheating agency) It was 5.00 pm or free. Since it was a pre paid order, The delivery boy marked the delivery on 5.01 to avoid/hide late delivery and then delivered the order after sometime. He got away because it was a pre paid order. Now I can't get my refund because the delivery guy, faked delivery by marking it at 5.01 Now these ppl are saying, since our system is showing delivery at 5.01, we can't do anything Worst experience",1
Fast and secure delivery by Zomato in corona pandemic (Thanks to Zomato) please order food once time and you get satisfied,5
its useless...i order the food.. and before delivery the delivery man he cancel the order.i was trying to call him but he's number is out of coverage. and it was paid order& i didn't gt my money refund.its just a money making company. only in zomato its happening like this..they are not giving their 100% for there customers. first of all they didn't deliver the food and 2nd they didn't refund my money also. seriously guys if your using this app then always pay the amount after the delivery only.,1
"Decreasing the rating from 5 to 1. Used to be amazing but these days their menu shows inflated rates, at least 40 to 50 rs. more per dish more than the actual restaurant rate. Don't knw if it's only for pro members like me but it's a real cheap strategy, least expected from zomato.",1
Internet speed during order is fast but as you browse their contact it slows down. But there is trick here that if you again want to order the speed will boost up. Once the order is placed they don't care about browsing speed for their contact numbers.,1
Please add actual accurate numerical data on macros and calories for healthy foods. Just categorising foods and restaurants as low calorie or high protein isn't enough. Most people who are trying to eat healthy aim to stay within a calorie budget and meet a specific protein goal (in gm) each day depending on their fitness goals.,3
"Very bad experience. I ordered a gift pack for my daughter, the item went missing. And the customer service says it will take 48hrs to get a resolution. Very unprofessional and unacceptable behaviour from them. Especially when they couldn't reach the restaurant or delivery partner themselves. What will the resolution mean to me after Holi???",1
"Today first time I ordered from Zomato & the experience is very bitter. I ordered food from their listed restaurant named Matka Biriyani. My order was one special chicken matka biriyani & one champaran mutton. But when I'm going to eat I saw that the pieces of chicken & muttons are very bad. There are only bones, no fleshes. The quality is also very average. When I lodged my complaint to zomato they told that without photo proof then can't do anything. This is service that zomato provides us.",1
Very good app easy to use and very convenient food ordering app,5
Zomato is an app through which you can order anything easily and within half an hour you will reach your home.,5
Very bad experience During first order amount deducted on bank account but order not placed and money not refunded,1
yeah. it's awesome to order here.. But sometimes the hotels provide with less quantity. that's the problem. otherwise Zomato is excellent.. (edited)-> Zomato is still good too. I only complain with the quantity that the hotel serves.,5
Definitely Simple and Crystal Clear over Swiggy......!!! Much better than Swiggy...Go for it,5
This app is a very very useless and time waste app in my life i order of food after 1hr he say your order is cancelled i am sleep hungery. Time waste app his delivery boy i call him 15 to 20 times he is busy every time after 30 min he say your order cancelled what the hell of this,5
"I'm a Pro member, and Zomato doesn't care about the poor experience I had. My delivered order had missing items, and gifting instructions were not followed. The agent on app said he was sorry and I could give a poor rating to the restaurant as if that was the resolution to cheating me of my money. When I insisted they said they will transfer my case to another agent and kept me waiting for 20 minutes but never got back. They don't care if your meal goes wrong or if you are cheated.",2
Fooling people. Charging 30% from restaurant and delivery charges with surge from customers that is finally apid by customer. They do not present quantity with rate and later offer upgrade to full. The rates mentioned before upgrade are regular full plate rate on restaurant menu. If you do not upgrade to full teh resauratnt serves you quarter as he has to pay 30% to zomato ans in full on 50-60% as again restaurant has to pay 30% to zomato. On other end they also charge delivery with surge.,1
30min free food policy it's a joke they are going to delay your order by 60 min as they will take it back to restrorand and make you pay again ... Avoid Zomato as it's clearcut cheating from there end even if they refund still you have to place fresh order which is not fear at all... Am deleting this app right away I sugesst we all should do the same and end of the day I realised what went wrong in asulat case in Bangalore and why it happened.. let's get together and romove this app from phone.,1
Option should be there to change the bank card details. If I want to deactivate the auto debit facility then how could I go.,4
"I wish there was option to order prepared sabzi, as sometimes I need sabzi only and nothing else. otherwise great app",4
Very good 😍😍 Very much useful when we stuck at place and there is no any option for food thnks zomato,5
This application has limited choices. Delivery seevi e is really bad. Twice I places an order and did not receive it however I received notifications on the app stating that my order has been delivered. Rather try talabat which seems to have a better delivery service.,1
"The food is simply outstanding here. I was travelling and missing some yummy and tasty food and saw this place on Zomato, ordered from here and was very happy and satisfied. We tried :- Paneer lababdar - The taste goes with the name and it was very tasty, mouthwatering thick & creamy gravy, enjoyed every bite of it. Mushroom Masala - was happy that I ordered this dish as the masala was amazing and the mushroom was marinated just right. Garlic naan & Butter Tandoori roti was also amazing",5
One of the worst food app...focus is just to generate revenue... multiple orders being handled by one rider... supplying cold food...and pathetic response from the customer executive.,1
Amazing app! Suggestion let orders from different places be acceptable..,4
It will be great if there is an option to add personal notes to each restaurant. Like what was good or not good there so that next time while ordering from same place we have can quickly see our previous experiences with that restaurant.,5
"Lol. Customer has a complaint. Takes time to relate issue over chat. Agent collects facts from Zomato app & is prepped to offer explanation of what happened! No willingness to enquire with the other end regarding a late delivery today that should've been avoided. No point expressing 'regret for my inconvenience' when this is the attitude. Making me feel guilty for reaching out for help. Not even expecting refund; expecting fair enquiry for late delivery. I hate liars, now this! 1 star for you.",1
Very good app people those who really not able get out during the pandamic they are get help with this app.thank you.,5
"Worse service......they provide breads in paper, that caused major health issue to me...as the ink of the newspaper was accumulated in my food, and I took the food without noticing it...I was hospitalized for 1 day because of food poisoning.....and if u order food in the morning ,then the restaurant will give the the leftover food of the previous day..this was the reason I stopped using this app ..because if I chat at customer service then they do not provide better service....",5
"Pathetic! I was a frequent user of zomato, but the last 5-6 experiences were horrible! They dont have any proper synchronization with the restaurants! I'm yet to receive the refunds which they state that they've initiated! The worst mistake was downloading the app! Only show off, no real result🙏",1
"Pathetic UI/UX experience, Worst customer support, 99% restaurant reviews are fake, yet people at Zomato are in absolute chills, sadly the common customer has not many options when it comes to these services, but given a choice I'd dump Zomato anyday. Swiggy > Zomato !!!",1
Overpriced. There is no parity between the price of an item shown on zomato vs price at the restaurant. Offers are not worth it. I'd rather go and get the order myself. UNINSTALLING IT.,1
"I tried to order food from nearest hotel/restaurant for Breakfast..As it's showing the Restaurant Name as : Raghavendra Tiffins..we thought that it would be around 20-25 mins Delivery...But it got booked with Raghavendra , Secunderabad.. I haven't noticed the Restaurant location..as it's not showing the Restaurant Location/Address openly.. Otherwise I would have chosen some nearby Restaurants..!",3
"The App is easy to use, Simple interface without sacrificing being thorough. Menu items could use more images, if zomato could do something from their side to make images on a listed item mandatory. Also the best Part the Zomato Gold program. If you don't save as much as you have paid they will refund the amount. And it is super useful for people who order food often or have large groups of friends over due to their offers having no 'upto' limit(although only for select restaurants)",5
"Really great experience using this application. Thanks for this great platform , hats off to the idea builders and team #zomato!",5
I love Zomata they always deliver food before the time.😋😇 and App UI is awesome.,5
"I am facing so much difficulty in contacting Zomato,they are not ready to help at all.I raised a issue with a order placed by me but got no response till now.Every time the agents,after reading my full message,are transferring the chat to the Zomato page by telling,I will transfer your chat to another specialised agent,but then the chat is not directed to any agent,but getting back to Zomato's page.Pathetic response from Zomato's side.Intentional behaviour to just ignore the concerned issue.",1
I odered from the Zomato app. They provide very bad service as they declined my order without any concern. They are not ready to talk with me and also they didn't refund my money instantly.,1
Worst customer support. Only templates send by Zomato is solution for issue raised. No proper food delivery. Always fault in food delivered. Never going to use zomato again and will ensure that people known to me also don't use. Heavy cost we pay including tax and delivery charge but no support received for the amount we pay.,1
I have had such a patgetic service from zomato. I ordered special fry piece biryani and got delivered chicken fried rice and chicken fry which was not good at all. I am allergic to egg so i didnt eat the chicken fried rice at all. I had to throw the food away as i am a visitor in tirupati.,1
"If food is total waste that you have ordered, Then don't think about the refund. Total waste of money. I have faced this several times,but this time I am not going to suffer anymore. Just uninstalled the app forever. Thanks zomato for horrible experience that I had with you. I wish could give zero rating or -5 rating.",1
"If I have the option to choose no star, I would. Worst Customer Service. They charge you and say there is a technical issue and made you wait for a refund for 7days! This happened twice so, please work on giving extra mile to your customers.",1
"Cannot cancel orders, have to contact customer support for it which may lead to delays and penalties. Unlike swiggy which allows cancellation immediately without penalty if cancellation done within the first minute, zomato has no such mechanism.",1
"Was happy earlier. Now a days they cant keep up with the delivery time they offer. Too late to deliver orders. And when look for options after waiting too long, their dummy chat boat will make you fool.",1
"By mistake once I ordered food from Theque. So, I had to cancel it because I didn't wanted the food at that time. When I faced this situation then there was no option of cancellation after ordering also. For I did it, from the App Management they removed the COD option from my app. Whenever I want to order food I have to prepay but if I don't have an bank account then how will I order. This behaviour literally disappointing me. I think I should stop using Zomato for some reasons.",1
Best 👍. Always I get offers and save money with every order. Steal deal!,5
"Very nice, easy to order and get good Qwality food. plz remove the delivery charges",5
Prices are sometimes too high and quantity and quality is ok ok that time,4
App issue taking service is horrible Has transferred ne to 4 assistors ...this app is a disaster...,1
This app provides us good quality food and also gives us so many offer on all the orders,5
Very bad service of zomato day by day.... I am getting more disappointed after every order..... Each time some mistake happens... Sometimes order is wrong.. Or items are missing... Or instructions are not followed... Or there is hair in the food... Since past 3 months i am having the WORST experience with zomato.... 0 stars for zomato 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻,1
One of the best apps for food delivery. Never had any problem. Customer support response is also fast and appreciable.,5
"Zomato is delivering to my neighbour but not me. For almost one year, my 2 phones and my wife's phone has same issue that 'we are not taking orders online. We will be back soon'. Few days back when I saw Zomato delivering to my neighbourhood, I came to know that problem is with my orders/location/account/whatever. I am regularly getting delivery from swiggy for months but not from Zomato.",2
"half of the times it shows some restaurants not accepting order online, but immediately after ordering from another restaurant, the same restaurants start accepting online orders. This is a zomato bug and needs to be fixed ASAP.",1
Nice job ..but delivery timmings is too much even also in night timmings ..but over all good job ....in specially thus days ...thank you ...,5
Very bad service.Wrong order items delivery. I ordered something and they delivered other thing.,1
"Other than occassional service hiccups & some bad restaurant partners, Zomato is a great food-delivery service, especially in Kolkata. They are the heroes of the COVID lockdown days. A little cut in delivery charge, especially for high value orders will be appreciated.",4
"Happend second time with me... Multiple items missing in orders. Then restaurant didn't pick your call, Zomato offers refund less than what I paid for the order. Disgusting....",1
Had a very unpleasant experience while ordering the food. They stop the timer in between for food delivery. I have screenshots will be sharing soon on Twitter and all social media Handel's. Worst customer experience. And when I asked for cancelation they refused stating order is on the way. And then I called the zomato delivery guy he said order will be taking some more time as it has not been prepared.,1
I have been charged excess amount and while explaining the issue to support team they have wasted one hour of mine and did nothing Their support team is just pathetic,1
No use of having pro membership purchased no extra discount not even reducing delivery charges really sucks,1
Very expensive. Zomato adds their price in addition to the restaurant price plus adds delivery charges. Also the surge charge is additional. Taxes are extra. Instead we can call the restaurant and order food or from their own inhouse apps.,1
"Most underrated app this is. No open text fields to chat with the rep for help on the orders. Unnecessary surge charges on minimum orders due to demand. I would like to give 1⭐ star but decided on rating 2 as this guys are at least open to deliver food. Try and delegate staff to interact with customers if yiu really care of. You guys are unbelievable. Will refer any of ppl I know or will prefer this app, either. Pathetic experience.",2
"Horrible experience with zomato. They have no customer support and they harass their customers coz once we create the order ,we can't cancel. Riders call and ask you to make other arrangements and when I get customer support,they say they will not refund. Pathetic customer service and will definitely share this experience will my friends and tell them to be careful with zomato.",1
"I had ordered from Zomato and 1 item was short, I reported it on the help. They gave the option of refund on original method in 6 to 7 days or instant Zomato credit. I chose instant Zomato credit and then it shows this credit is only valid for 30 days. What is the point of refunding if you have 30 limit to utilise it. I am keeping my money in your custody and then you say if you don't use it in 30 days, then the money is mine. This is a example of textbook fraud.",1
"Even though having pro-membership, treatment is ordinary. Chat support is horrible. one agent will diver you to other and other to another.. they will keep playing till you fade up and give up.. If you order sabzi and chapati and if chapati does not get delivered, zomato will give you refund of chapati only and they will ask to order chapati again and charge delivery charges again. Zomato will ask you to have only sabzi without chapati (breads).. pathetic policies and pathetic customer support.",1
"I think Zomato is charging absurd amount as delivery charges. Plus, I have noticed that its quality of delivery has reduced in the last 3 months. Reducing rating from 5 to 3.",3
The chat support is WORST!! There was an item missing from my order and I messaged in the chat support. All they sent was the same message over and over again like a bot and they stopped messaging after that. I still didn't get my money back. Do something about this Zomato.,1
Very very fast service and they take care their customer's....i totally satisfied...keep up the good work ## Zomato 😊😊,5
"I had got Coupon of 60% off on Zomato App on Phone Pay. Tried availing it on the order above 159(One of the condition) but the offer was not applied. Tried one more time,this time it said that offer cannot be applied anymore. Tried contacting Customer care but none of them were available and my chat was closed without my Consent.",1
Good timing on delivery and covid time very safe and clean work,5
Pathetic Service. Chat team not answering my quarries they are just transferring chat to another agent continuously. After placing order restaurant call me and they told due to some problem they are unable to deliver your order for next 2 hrs... Why don't u updates on ur app these problem.... They cancel my order but did not receive any confirmation msg.,3
I am enjoying my meal in 4 different states as I am traveling. All the cities has awesome coverage.,5
"Zomato is a good service but it has exceptionally bad delivery people who are not trained in using maps or having an idea of the city they work in, this really creates a hassle. Otherwise as an app it is quite goof and helpful.",3
Zomato delivery guys keeps procrastinating the delivery probably because they carry multiple orders. I have no issues with zomato handing over multiple orders to a single person at the same time but at least this should be transparent if the order is arriving in 20 min or 1 hr.. dont misguide the customers..,1
Very fast delivery and food that delivers are very delicious.... Pizza was so so yummy... Love zomato.... 😍,5
Fast service and good packaging and safety thank you Delivery Boy and Zomato,5
Very nice app for online food ordering. The only concern is that if food don't come as per your expectation or of inferior quality you have no proper remedy for that.,4
Worst service queries not solved and support team was not hear your problem only say wait wait wait,1
"The app is very slow to apply order need to improve the app This is still taking so much time to open app to place the orerd this very pathetic & worst food delivery app ther is no toll free no to make the complaint, I started placing order from 7:30 pm but still taking so much time to place rhe order, even though changed the NW settings from the mobile.",1
Poor custom support when it comes to complains regarding items missing or order not followed. No action was taken and was made to waste time on an unproductive customer care chat that lasted for about 30 mins ..,1
The rates of dishes mentioned on Zomato are always higher than actual rates of the hotel despite charging for delivery. Also compared to swiggy the rates of items are higher. Always compare and call up the hotels to find out if they are delivering.,3
"Been using the apps over the years. Seen a lot of good changes, seamless usage. Good experience with the interface as well as the customer service ! But 1 star less because of a misplaced order (which was later replaced seamlessly). Please check the parcel once before delivery.",4
"I personally can rely on this app whenever hungry. Good services & Restaurants connected with the app. Application is user friendly for every age groups . It works fast than expected & As a responsibility it fulfills all needs for Food options. Thank you Zomato for being their for Us. Saying that, Zomato has most disciplined Delivery Agents who does their duties within Time .",5
It is a best app but nowdays become the worst .they dont accept cash above 490 and once the order is cancelled by mistaken also zomato removes the cash on delivery option which is horrible...disgusting.. Though i have ordered a lot of things..zomato dosent see that they stick to their policies customer satisfaction is no more important to zomato...,1
It was good and convenient for ordering the food that I love. It is fantastic if there is a feature for adding extra items to cart after ordering till the delivery boy took the order from the restaurant. 😃😃😃,4
"The restaurants should give more priority towards customers health and hygiene. I ordered a biriyani and I got a rubber band inside. In this present situation all people are concerned about their health. So importance of personal health and hygiene comes in first priority. We order food online, so that we will get a change from same food and also to get some rest from daily busy life. If the restaurants are not taking care of such important aspects we will be forced to stop ordering.",2
"Worst app & service ever.. They will also offer Pro membership in return of some money but you won't get anything for your membership.. They will make you embarrassed @ hotels when you dine in additionally when you complaint about this to customer care, your call/ chat will be disconnected to make you realize that, you aren't a customer but a beggar/fool",1
"It is a really good and efficient app as they have all types of cuisines and over a thousand restaurants and I really have no issue with them. The one thing I don't like is the ""if you don't get your order within this time then ur food is free"" thing..No its actually not for free they just give you a coupon for the amount your order costed and you have to use it within 7 days...like if u want the whole free dilema it's just not possible and no they don't give it for free.",4
The worst app.. Food not delivered to us and the payment got deducted and the customer service is very bad. They do not provide the drivers number nor the customer care has any details of the order. To raise issue we need to chat with the executives and they are pathetic. I in my life will never order from zomato..,1
"Very happy with the coupons, service and the customer care. I had Zomato long before the deliveey services have started, it used to be like a guide to choose restaurents to dine.. Moreover i am satifed since then. There surely are some minor issues, like while booking the estimated time shows a value, say an hour but still after 1 hour it still shows some time remaining, i.e. the timer is not genuine when running late due to what ever issue.. it can be corrected",4
"I have been using Zomato for over an year, but from past three months I have been facing payment failures constantly. I couldn't get any refund for the money they have deducted from my Zomato credits. I lost nearly Rs.4000. don't use Zomato, they are looting money from the customer's. I spoke to their customer service and even write mails regarding my money. Still their response is very poor. I suggest Swiggy, it's way better than Zomato.",1
Its ridiculous.. i ordered at 7 pm evening nd didnt recieved my order it kept showing my order is late and it vil reach within 18 minutes.. delivery boy didnt take my calls and switched off his phone. I waited for my order for long 3 hours. There is no customer helpline no and no option to cancel d order if it doesnt reach on time.. where do i report my issues. After everything at 1 am next day i recieved a mail that my order was paid.,1
The worst restaurant application ever! My food stays in the restaurant for more than 1 hr. And 40 min without any driver to pick it up!! And customer service are so bad!,1
"Worst when it comes to assistance, 90% of the time whatever i order, there's something or the other wrong in it. Like if i would order chicken something then either it will come to be of veg or paneer, or just nothing! So why do u guys showoff fake service only? When at last u don't give a damn! I tell u why i say this coz there was no assistance from other side to help me with the queries, it asked to write a feedback that's it! Our money grows on trees no,so we have to eat whatever they give!",1
It's delivery is fast and they provide a very good service,5
Its has improved soo much. I was soo excited and surprised to see that Zomato gave me the option for use my ADCB Touch points to pay my bill in just one click....good job guys...i have become your pro member and inshallah will keep renewing it every 3 months. Let me know if you have some good membership deal for 1 year,5
Zomato experience is always seamless. You keep returning for more and more 😉,5
Earlier I had issues with the customer experience but I must say now they are working great.,4
There should be a system where a person can't order food from another city to another city. This is a bug zomato have to solve as soon as possible. Otherwise I am quite satisfied with the service and discount offers I get here,4
"Worst app ever!!! Awful Experience with Zomato !! Login by OTP is not working for 15 days now. Also No offers or Promo codes are applicable now on Zomato. On top of this, Cash on delivery is not available on Zomato for more than 3 weeks !! I wanted to rate Zomato 0/5 stars but unfortunately this option is not available on Play store.",1
"The service quality has been degrading day by day. I am frustrated with the frequent issues that I have to face with Zomato. Thing we're much better before but somehow with more restaurants coming on to Zomato, the quality has taken a back seat.",1
"Despite coupon code they've charged for delivery. Customer support team takes lot of time to respond and the charges are high atleast by 5% compared to market ratio. The person who calls doesn't have solution not can make decisions and they never consider making customer happy. Escalated twice or thrice and they just say thank you. Items were missing in my previous order and when I flagged it up, I was at loss and wasted time by escalating.",1
"My experience with Zomato, till now is very satisfactory and absolutely nothing to complain about.",5
Today I order Lunch pack extra plain Raita along with it. I didn't recive my complete order. I paid extra for plain Raita. And when I m trying to contact support or order issue for refund. After clicking it on it Ijust just getting out pop out directly. It's request kindly see my last order and and refund it. It's happen to many times plz see to it.,1
Very poor delivery time current order showed time as 2 more minutes. But all of a sudden the valet is delivering somewhere else. Now it shows 7 more minutes. But i doubt the distance. Zomato unable to keep the promise of deliver time even there is no traffic congestion or road blockages,1
"Not Provided the Costumer care number for Directly spoke, Only chat options is available with the computer, Delayed service many times. In-Spite of lots of complaints no one call you from Zomato Side.",1
1. The order was booked under on time delivery scheme but my valet was not even in the 50 metres of my radius. I was continuously asking him to come in my direction but he was not able to find the right way. Atlast i sent my brother to take the parcel till then the valet met my brother on the road. The time of 2.53 pm was crossed and i received my order on around 2.59 pm as per zomato notification. 2. Not able to update the app 3. Refund policy is vry bad It should be upon d taste quality also,1
"Horrible app.. Nowadays frequently whenever I want to order something it shows ""Sorry, no restaurants deliver to your current location at this time"".. Then why we install the app if it's not capable of delever the food when we wanted it badly",1
Aap should stop unfair and misleading activities for the benefits of the customers and partners. App shows that the delivery valet has reached the restaurant. When you call the valet he is actually far away from restaurant and delivering earlier orders. This results in friction between customer band valet and also between restaurant. This is highly objectionable. When customer care number is reached the bots reply vaguely and ask to contact valet and restaurants.,1
"They don't verify quality of restaurants. Half of their merchants don't even have proper restaurant, some prepare food in a shelter/shed/ godown and deliver food.",1
Going towards end of era.... Not giving importance to its customers. They are mixing veg and non veg items everytime. Also customer care services are very poor. They are not responding to queries and in between conversation they are vanished like bubbels and we are waiting for replies.,1
"Their first contact of customer service is pathetic. But after struggling for hours at late night. I even left my belive in them but in the morning when i woke up. I saw the refund notification. It was not all about the refund, it was about the clean, safe and hygiene policy of yours in which you failed. Rating 4 for the struggle i faced with your cc. And don't dare to remove my uploaded review ever. I always keep snapshot of the review i give to anyone.",4
"In swiggy and zomato app i just want to order something and tried difference between these two company with same hotel, same menu, same quantity and result was - Swiggy Cost : 238/- (No offer was there) Zomato : 300/- (No offer was there) If you not trust me then see comparison yourself",1
The order is never on time I observed that a single delivery boy is taking multiple orders and it is always running late,1
Thank you Zomato for satisfying our hunger for good food during this pandemic. Hats off to the valet partners who risking their lives to deliver us the food. Would enjoy it even more if we get more Jain food options.,5
Delivery contact sucks to core they don't have proper delivery method even the customer care people don't respond properly this was experienced by me more then once,1
"Usually high waiting time. Tried in diffent cities but it is happening everywhere. If u compare a same restaurant in Zomato and other food delivery app, U will come to know the huge difference in delivery time. Not a fan of Zomato..",1
Great. Fast delivery. Very fast refund.i appreciate them very much. I am happy with Zomato.,5
Unable to order as dlvy charges and taxes are too much. PL look into this.,2
Pathetic service and even more pathetic customer care. They are in the business just for the money. Quality and customer satisfaction are not in their dictionary. I wrote an email to the email address that's mentioned in the comments from Zomato. Guess what everyone in the customer service has predefined answer with no solution whatsoever.,1
There was an issue with the ordered food. I am trying to approach through mail but there was no response from zomato. It was second time repeated the same. So waste of ordering in zomato. If they don't mind customer's problem then waste pf ordering.,1
It was better before.Now it asks us to order more than what we want.What we want to order and how much we need is our wish but it's asking us to order food in such a way that the charge should match a threshold price otherwise orders are not getting accepted and this is so horrible. You should respect one's choice and needs.,3
"I love this app but I have one suggestion which I would love if you consider, please do not put time limit on food delivery because due to time constraints delivery person driver very rashly since they have to deliver on time and people get scared specially cyclists like me of their harsh driving.",4
"excellent service super to get the order Yum yum yum yum sweets and cake's and food. Love it, . Thank you zomato for the yummy food",5
Zomato has lost its zeal in delivering food ontime. It's much better with other applications. Here you just need to wait in queue for longer times and a simple sorry message popps up. Customer service is also very very poor.,1
Items are missed many times and no refund is received.,1
After Covid they only GET money and don't deliver service. Their support team don't know why delivery is not assigned to your order for 1 hour and try to assign for another 30 mins and after 2 hours still no delivery and they DONT reimburse the huge amount you pay. Because they don't have a refund policy any more. You pay for things you never receive.,1
We received a message from our bank that an amount of 866.01 has been deducted from the account by zomato whereas we have not placed any order on the date of the transaction. Please return our money because this is not the first time this has happened and we cannot ignore this error any further.,1
Please don't download the app. They don't give value to their customers Multiple times we felt the issue post ordering the food we select one location but delivery people goes to other place saying that on their phone other location is displaying And then we get our so late than expected delivery time,1
"Restaurants delay a lot. Even though there is on-time option for cashback, every delay means the food that comes is not fresh and never hot. Tea, samosa, KFC, pizza, idli, poori...nothing is hot. Valets have rude behavior, they hand over wrong items very often. I personally have poor experience.",1
Zomato Valet services are the worst services. Swiggy is far better than Zomato to provide good deals and quality services. App also needs a lot of amendments. It show wrong live location and fails to provide accurate rider location too. Needs more improvements.,1
Even after a receiving the pictures and reason for the useless food. They didnt provide refund. For me they simply said that the food is usual restaurant styles can't do refund. We just threw the food outside. Swiggy always provide customer satisfaction service. They verify it properly not like zomato. Not recommended,1
Order dilevery is always on time and as far as food quality is aways on top and who standard is followed....Bon appetite,5
The food item was wrongly delivered and zomato took 45 mins to not able to replace and finally i had to force them to refund.,1
Pathetic customer service. Chat page never loading when you have issue with order,1
Easy to use but very few hotels and restaurants are available. And Limited choices of places from where we can order.... and the hotel which doesn't deliver trough Zomato deliver in private order... so no use but ok.. in emergency. Would recommend swiggy instead,3
"Bad experience --- I couldn't apply 1st order coupon ""WELCOME"" due to technical issues and then ordered with full payment without any discount. And customer care is just apologizing and there is no compensation or coupon code provided for next order. 1st impression is bad impression.. wasted and uninstalled",1
"In my life this is worst app. No delivery on time or not acceptable. This app always say that we come soon So,plz don't support this app",1
"most trusted food delivery app... and best too.. but not anymore affordable in 2021, they hike the food prices of the restaurants ( at least 10% to 20% price difference between online and offline of the same restaurant's) plus they sometimes add taxes on food. So for my side I have to downgrade from 5star to 4star.",4
"Swiggy has been very successful, but the Zomato app has been very interactive and picking up well.",5
I hate their support system. I can't chat or write any problem directly to customer representatives. Only automate bot chat which not helpful. Many times I get cheated for my order. But no help. Most worst support service & no resolution for incorrect items and bad quality food.,3
Very bad service. Order was cancelled within any reason after payment was done.,1
Zomato helping ma a lot during this pandemic. Zomato service and Zomato delivery agents much needed this 5* rating. Thanks Zomato,5
FREE DELIVERY BIG SCAM : OPTION free delivery if order gets delay late : They have to do free delivery and money should be refunded. But once the order gets delay: They call you and say seller not accepting order so order will be cancelled and money will be refunded.They wasted time and no food no money. Ban Ban cheating scam...,1
App is fine but most of the time offers/coupon does not work. If you want to raise this concern with customer care you can't because they will only allow you to raise the concern for the orders you have raised already,2
Superb app ...very easy to order .and best offers ...thanku zomato ...,5
Superb app to get the meal as you like to eat anytime anywhere.,5
"While booking rates are changed, it talks about your control over partner restaurant.",3
App is nice and your delivery boy very gentle with well manner.,5
Before Diwali one shop doing good but after Diwali stupid thing started. I ordered 4-5 times and all times restaurant make troubles. When I see reviews and people have same issue. Quality is gone. That jerk is ruined whole zomato platform. Restaurant greed people for good review. This is written in one review as well. Zomato will not take action. So this zomato is now become garbage app.,1
Very bad service.. ordered 2 hr before but there is no response from Zomato even after confronting with support chat and even worse Zomato wallet is not picking calls though I called him atleast 10 times,1
Zomato is always nice but the way they are charging for taxes and extra charges its not got its kind of an modern Savkari,5
"its good 60 percent of time, rest 40 percent you dont get food as expected. Many times items are missing and they throw money back on your face while u wish to dine fine.",1
Very passable service. More than often the valet goes missing with the food and zomato has no ways to contact them. All they offer is some menial amount of coupon to cover for the order. Lack any respect or courtesy towards the customers.,1
Why is this so slow? Took a solid 3 minutes to go from choosing the dishes to even open the payment portal.. and another solid 4 minutes before the payment is confirmed on the app after I get the SMS from the bank.. just irritatingly slow.. services are good but the app response gets on your nerves..,2
"Zomato is not opening , tried to reinstall as well but same issue persists. Error message: ""something went wrong "". Have been facing this since one week Please assist. 1. Internet is 100 MPBS so no issues there 2. Rest of phone apps are working normally",1
"Even though I haven't granted any permission, Zomato app reads OTP received over SMS while setting up for the first time use. Thus violating security and privacy of smartphone. For technical info, my phone is running Android 11.",1
"Before registering any restaurant, please verify their hygiene,quality & others issue. It should continue as surprised check also. In absence of same credibility may go down wards. There are some restaurants in your list are horrible.",4
"App is slow, and crashes frequently. Also, a very important feature that should be added, us being able to schedule delivery. Edit- now one cannot rate a restaurant or food unless they attach a photo! That's a stupid idea",3
It gave nice experience but some dishes are not available in delivery to house,3
Being a pro member we didn't find much benefits like its competitors. We are charged delivery fee even though enrolled for pro membership. Also very limited pro restaurants. Offers not good. Congested user experience in navigating the mobile app.,2
Bad because far away restaurant you can't order but I like that because theere are so many offers you can save your money👍 So there is also one thing mising like there is no live tracking like dominos please upgrade the tracking system and there if have one more option like if I search biryani and restaurants come but if I search and most rated birayni on top and 2 most odered 3 most cheap if I search biryani,3
"No one knows what kind of delivery boys they have. Their delivery boys are rude, violent to especially woman customers, unpredictable. We do not want to endanger our safety or our women's safety using such apps. App is slow and delivery boys often land up at wrong addresses despite location given in detail. Not all outlets are listed or can be ordered here. Better to order from local outlets directly than use apps of such companies. It also sends too many ads, messages",1
Charges surge price but delivery is still late compared to normal times,1
The app is nice and i got a good discount because of which i am giving it a three star but my first experience with food and delivery was the worst🤢🤢 the food was burnt...i hope it does not happen the next time.,3
"Zomato is showing message ""This restaurant is not delivering at your location"" for most of the restaurant. But at the same time Swiggy is accepting orders for same restaurants and delivering also to the same location. What's wrong with Zomato......",2
"First they take the order and payment is made then you say that item is not available and cancel the order. Very bad experience... They also cancel the order at their whims & fancy, citing unavoidable reasons. Pathetic Service. More of it.... The same thing happened today also... On 14th of Feb.... I ordered for my family and paid..... But they again canceled my order..... Worst experience with ZOMATO.... The support executive assigned was. TANYA who was worst in customer service..... WORST Exp",1
"One of the best and leading applications for food delivery's, everyday there is a new and exiciting restaurant for me to order food from , one of the best thing of zomato is the Deal of the day offers (DOTD) gives me alot of discount in my favourite resturants. It was one the first food delivery application in uae , And it is still the best.",5
Some items are missing and food was not cooked properly we are very much disappointed,1
"When you install this app for first time , it gives you many offers for a month or two but after that they stop giving you offers . They will show that your particular shop is closed even it is actually open.",2
Your app is dead slow.. u guys don't know what causes the app dead slow.. It's frustrating,1
Just make sure they are no bugs in payment process and add customer service in case of emergency. overall loved the app interface but still make sure they are no bugs and glitches and make liter version of the app so everyone can use the app😋,4
"It's a good experience after a long time, but still the delivery takes too long.",4
"Customer service is very poor. I discussed with customer executive several times to inform that in my payment option page, credit card payment is disable. Executive is continuously saying only one sentence that ""we do not block anytjing. Please discuss with you bank"". They are unable to understand that it is not with one aingle bank. Whole credit card payment option is disable. Today discussed with executive Ashi. They do not share email id also, so that I can share sxreen shot. Very pathetic.",1
I love Zomato's customer support. The customer service is very supportive and the best thing is that they follow up any kind of delay in the delivery very seriously. Apart from this the user interface of the app is quite good. SO GREAT 👍🏻😊,5
I ordered at 9:28 and recieved at 11:10..after lot of follow ups on phone ...will never order on Zomato...it was my first and last time as well..if you can't service then at least dont accept the orders ...I was happy with other apps earlier,1
The food price is higher than actual and the delivery fee is just too high. And the zomato pro membership is just a gimmick nothing special for pro. There should be some discount in delivery for pro members if not then why it is called pro!!,1
Zomato doesn't have enough drivers and takes orders that can't be delivered on time. It has happened twice with us in 2 days. They waste an hour of yours in delaying the order past the actual delivery time and then give a begging of Dhs 10 in the form of promo code to show what a fun they made of you. The delivery boys punch an order as delivered and actually deliver 10 mins later.,1
U can't cancel the order once you punched...not after a second..u need to contact customer support for that also and the cancellation amount will be entire bill....u can't change the rating....for anything to everything u need to customer support.,1
Worst customer service it's more then 1 hr the agent keep on asking me to wait. Worst application with no customer care number. Third class experience.,1
"Zomato is unethically over charging for online orders. I used to love the app earlier, I don't mind being charged more if I'm told that I'm being charged extra. But hiding it from customers is totally not acceptable. The customer support just diverts saying the restaurants hike the price, but Zomato does not take any steps to avoid this.",2
"I'm directly rating 5 star cause the delivery guy was so polite in speaking. Really appreciated. So I'm just editing this . Yesterday was my first ORDER today when i went to order i realised you don't give much offers , what much!? No offers at all . Not happy",5
Unable to add any instructions even within 30 seconds of order. None of the contact numbers passed on for the restaurants work... facing lot of issues on the app. The chat window often posts issues to get opened.,1
It is very bad app as well as when I ordered my food then the time was showing 6 minutes and it was not getting over it still there then the for over but they were showing only 6 minutes and my food was not getting to me and the hotel was awesome not so far from my house at it take total 1 hour to come at my home and give me the food and there's no changes like giving 143 for with the like is a zomato started last time,1
"Worst service. if ur phone is not reachable. Then they will nither deliver nor refund ur amount. Only call is the way to.inform about delivery . No sms , no mails, no alternate number . Don't order from here. You may suffer from this condition.",1
The delivery takes long time. It is almost an hour now haven't received my order from a nearby outlet. A big no to this app. Not at all customer centric food application. Please everyone don' t use this app.,1
"At least it's better than other delivery apps in its offers and services. Although it has many restaurants with low quality of food, delivery part has no such problems. It would be much better if the creators had free delivery.",5
Poor chat service They never solved any problem Dispite they creat problem Worst service and I not shy to share chat screenshot of the chats,1
"I ordered a meal from the app, now these people are very very smart.. firstly I apologize I was at mistake that I put a wrong address in the order but within next second I got aware that I have ordered it wrong address and tried seeking help to either cancel or change the delivery option ... then I selected the support section for same and they asked me the reason to cancel the order and I selected that I choose wrong delivery address then there was a executive assigned to me and no one chatted",1
"Not satisfied with its service, very careless regarding orders and it does not care whether order has been placed or not but deducts your money from your bank account too quickly and takes a long time to refund the deducted amount.",1
I m really happy with Zomato services. Good food and safe delivery. Thanks zomato.,5
"Late delivery and depressingly useless customer service. Expect delays and get only ""truly deeply sorry for your experience"" as their solution. And their response time is also super slow for customer service.",1
"Absolutely smooth and user friendly interface with in depth clarity about the food items and various restaurants in terms of quality, quantity and availability. Proper health and sanitary updates through live tracking and a well organised delivery structure with more or less accurate time management.",5
Awesome food very tasty 😋😋 and good delivery and cash on delivery available good delivery boys and girls talking very good appreciate to me,5
Everything was perfect the prices were reasonable the delivery boy was good he was wearing a proper mask and was sanitize he was maintaining 6 feet distance and that is what I accept from a delivery boy everything was perfect and I would recommend download the app and buy anything I I got to know so many places where I can find the best food thank you is Zomato,5
The service is good but I will suggest something which is very useful to all see when we add one item from one restaurant and same time we want to order from other restaurants so final price should be the total of it n not separate billings coz it gets our bill more,4
Ease of use and best delivery service. Long way to go. Keep it up.,5
Simply amazing experience. Booked my first order during heavy rains and amazed how fast the delivery was made by the guy. The quality was also kept in mind as the food was freshly prepared and packaging was nice. I recommend this to anyone who is looking to get a quick home delivery.,5
Restaurant delivery wrong item and also item missing but Zomato guy's doing nothing. The chat options are worst. Several times same question and same reply. Add cooking instructions the same. Good for nothing. Zomato executive thinking customer are fools. Very bad experience..,1
"Zomato gave me an 60% discount on my first order that's a kind thing about them hoping for more offers like that, Thankyou Zomato.!!",4
"Delivery time 41 minutes is too much it should be 20 25 minutes, because time is 💰.",4
It can b possible if order delivered at wrong location or any one can eat my order in middle of delivery so how can be I responsible for that. This thing happened with me my order is not delivered to me and they are showing order cancelled and not refunded my money also. Completely disappointed with this company...... Will not use any more and will suggest in my friend circle not use this company....,1
"Horrible experience! Food is ready, the assigned Zomato valet has also collected the order, but he is not allowed to deliver it to me since he has been asked to collect two orders at a time! My food is ready since more than 30 mins now, it's chicken roll hence cannot be consumed later if not delivered in time. Zomato is ready to compromise with the food but not assign a separate valet for another order!",1
"I've downloaded this app 3 times in last 3 weeks to order food on weekends, but it doesn't sends me otp on my mail id for login, so have to order from swiggy everytime. That's why deleting this app again. Please try to fix this issue, email is correct but I don't get any otp for login.",1
"I got duped on my first order, the delivery boy went to a wrong location and cancelled the order...Zomato chat support is a nightmare, it's been over 30 minutes and all I hear from the support person is ""stay connected"".",1
Worst delivery service. Their systems take too long to assign a driver and if they are not able to find one they blame the restaurant! Get your business sorted - talabat and careem are way better. Last time I use your app.,1
"Now , i cant open grocery option and thats why i have changed from 4 stars to 2 stars",2
The UI is not user friendly. The menu doesn't give the food description. And strangely it shows the category of food which can be mistaken for the description. Will avoid using this app unless the restaurant is not listed on Swiggy.,1
Terrible delivery.. I order for dinner and expected time to delivery was 9 pm and order was late by more than 2 hour.,1
Very fast and convenient. Too good to place your favourites!,5
The app is very good it's delivery is very fast I m satisfied with this app ☺☺🥰🥰,5
Good experience with Zomato Food is on time. Delivery guys are very professional.,5
I ordered noodles and a side dish and when I opened the package the noodles were burnt. Told Zomato representative but they can only refund the noodle amount deducting coupon code value. There is no replacement system in Zomato. Now if I order another noodle it will cost me more since I ordered multiple items that time for which I got coupons and only one delivery and packaging charges were added. Replacement system should be there as it was restaurant fault to give me burnt noodles.,2
"Zomato's hidden costs have been steadily increasing. Very soon, over 50% of the cost of the food will be Hidden Costs of Random Taxes, Packaging, and lots of unaccounted costs etc. The Final Cost Breakdown is Shameful.",3
Very good genuine price and meny offers and Zomato delivery boys are humble and polite,4
I come from a strictly vegetarian family. Ordered through this app and we got a non veg meal delivered to our house instead. Contacted your staff but they seemed very casual about it !!,1
Amazing food vendors choices as compared to swiggy and other food ordering apps.,5
Zomato is charging more amount. Suppose 2idli rate is rs.25 in restaurant but zomotao is showing rs.35 and zomato will add delivery charges + gst + parcel charges so it will become around rs.130+..,1
"Late denivery, first it was showing me for 20 min again it was extended to 45 min, thia is not the first time. I observed multiple time, and even no response for resolving the issue. Please make sure to provide the delivery on time.",1
You guys put up so many ads telling you deliver on time if not we will refund the amount. I had received the order late when I had to report it on the app it is not giving me the option!? Such bad service.,1
Really third class customer service. Not able to take decision and blemming us for restaurant mistake ... very third class service. Swiggy much better they treat cx excellent,1
Excellent service and prompt delivery also getting exciting offers,5
Such a long wait to get the food. 90 min to get your food. Die with hunger,1
Very good apps..fast booking...faster delivery...polite delivey boys...keep it up..,4
"Unbeatable when it comes to offers, service and convenience! ❤️",5
The fact that some of the restaurants dont deliver but it shows they do.. after the order is placed and payment is made.. restaurant calls and says they cant or wont deliver. By the money is already deducted and when u chat with them for refund Zomato takes 4 to 7 days and thats it.. believe me Deliveroo instantly refunds it and gives you complimentary discounts also.. so very F'in disappointed with Zomato services and customer assistance..,1
Very good dining experience and options available.,5
"At first Zomato Pro had great deals. I even supported them by buying membership during lockdown, but now the offers on Pro are practically useless unless you buy above a certain amount. We are also charged for delivery inspite of being members. I'm regretting taking Pro membership, will not do so again.",2
"Worst app, don't use this i got notification ""your delivery partner was unable to deliver order because he wasn't able to reach me on my phone"", bc why we are giving full address with house number you should reach directly there. After cancellation i charged for cancellation charges for full amount tried to teach with delivery partner aakash having phone number 70203 73005 he agreed to deliver with additional 100 rs payment after that also he didn't deliverd my order. Chutiya policies of yours.",1
Very easy to use and tracking all restaurants available Best app,5
I'm a user of Zomato since many years but last 6 months my experience is very bad with Zomato. Sometimes Charges deducted twice refund is not received. and many times it happens to me that I ordered some cake but received another one. And if asked to replace it they denied. They said that you were given an option to select the different designs but I have not selected the option of different designs but selected the item which is displayed on the picture. Cheaters.,1
"The service levels have gone down, I have installed Swiggy, Swiggy is better am now deleting Zomato. Best of luck Zomato",1
Customer support is very worst they didn't even response to my queries. If we can meet any issues regarding food quality here no one is there for resolving the issue. I chat with the support agent he doesn't care about the customer concern simply sending the default messages and left.,1
"Lately zomato is acting lame, whenever you place your concern it says ""we are experiencing high volume and write an email"" for my displeasure multiple times you expect me to write you an email? And even if you write an email they would turn a deaf ear on you. If the zomato management is reading this you might as well fix it or else i might have to put it on social media regarding your incompetency. Extremely disappointed. My ticket number is ##7574293#",1
"I pin my location which is displayed correctly on the map, but the location name is different. I had it saved also, still the same issue. Hence the delivery gets delayed and I have to call the delivery agent frequently for updates.",1
"I used the ""Repeat order"" feature of Zomato but the order i get is not exactly same and when i asked for the refund they refunded for the item which came different. Instead of Gravy Manchurian and Fried rice , they gave me Dry Manchurian and Fried rice. Because of this my whole order get spoiled, and they are refunding only for Manchurian. Please explain, Is this correct? Why customer will suffer for your mistake.",1
"It is all good, fast delivery, good service, but they do not have the option of cash on delivery above 350 rupees, which is a little depressing for people who do not have the option of online payment. All other services are good",3
"It's a great app, really meets your expectations, would have given this a 5 star but the notifications they are just too annoying, like too too annoying. Else everything is nice.",3
"I thought it could be better on every time I ordered but cheated every time. Food quantity is not at all match with direct restaurant order, don't know what's wrong with Zomato orders but the price is same.",1
"Order delivered wrong, case solved with a sorry and asked to understand as it an exception",1
"beware of horrible dumbo chatbots & irresponsive customer service, incase of any food delivery issues..no answerabilty , ur money is lost... Mostly prices are marked up & inflated by 30-45%, plus huge delivery , surge , distance & packaging charges..better prefer directly ordering from restaurant, & u will get a much better deal & at actual price..",1
"Order not delivered but says delivered. Tech support in app not working. So summary, lost 500 Rs :(",1
User friendly app. Prompt service. Covid norms followed well.,5
Was happy with zomato now they are going down orders are not properly checked and in one case a valet runs away with my food and customer service is like you received the food...wt the hell later after 20-30 mins they intiate refund and when i placed an order again same thing repeats,3
I want to order regularly from zomato but cant do ordering because of very high delivery partner fee. Zomato is charging Rs 34 - 40 as delivery fee for a restaurant which is only 0.5 km from my house. So why should i order from zomato. Well thanks for Reply but thats not the solution for my question. Rs 34 delivery fee + Taxes is not worth for a restaurant nearing 200- 300 mtrs from my location. A person can call restaurant for free delivery up to Rs 150 order for 0.5 km range. Why i should use zomato.,1
After last update live update stopped showing have to open support everytime to know about order status,1
I have been a customer to this app from past many years and the customer support has never treated me in a good way I had taken a order and I got it with a very bad condition however had it and had a chat with one of the agent and they informed will refund the chagres but till date I haven't received any refund or anything and moreover I had a chat again by following up a guy called Sourav he just replied in such a manner as if I ate food in his money very much bad experience I never excepted,1
Too much charges for delivery and packing. Abt 50% of the food charge. Sometimes Hotel wants us to order not lesser than 250. They do not want customers ordering for single food. Not satisfied with the service.,1
"App sucks to the core, the developer had only one job and he totally messed it up. Hotels are most of the time not loading, always getting empty page. Had to refresh 10 times to get the atleast 1 hotel in the list or had to close and open multiple times. This sucks. You guys really suck.",1
"I can't use your stupid zomato credits as it will always be a payment gateway error. Just refund my money please. It's been happening since November 2020. You guys keep giving me credits then I try to use and it will take partial amount from my card and payment error happens and the credits can never be used. Don't send your generic email template as response, know the history of the complaint and give me a final solution.",1
"Thanks for Express delivery,but U NEED TO BE VERY SURE&SENSIBLE prior to ordering as the problem is ur order CON'S: CAN'T be CANCEL or NO REFUND . COD Is selected as a payment method,delivery guy should have change with him,No change is an excuse they make PRO'S:Nice and express delivery within a mentioned time,Good to see the punctuality. Reasonable delivery charges",4
The worst thing of this app.to me is there is almost no discount I got yet.There is unique-unique payment option in the time of payment when-after I completed the orders.This is very dissapointing from Zomato! You guys should look at this.Otherwise it's to be compelled to me to order the next time from any other known app.Thank you...,4
This app is not giving the option to use cash on delivery and it's so frustrating.. whenever i try to order something there is always cash on delivery is not available. Why is that so?? Please fix this or what can i say..,1
"Canceled my order after 1hr 30 mins saying they can't deliver. That too after I called thwm for status. Such a careless attitude. No action on the restaurant and no compensation to the customers. Same story repeats again. And ya, don't add generic reply, You can retrive my order details and check.",1
"Current version of app is wrost. There is no option in bottom of screen to view/track your current or past orders, to do so you have to click on your profile first. The bottom options of app are filled with pro membership ads and donations where there should be an option to view orders. Are you kidding me?",1
"Almost all the times , they cut sorry figure , and late delivery is only consistency at Zomoto India.",1
Heavy cheating on zomato. The prices are increased too much and then offers are given so that people order. Unnecessary we need to order more food to meet minimum order value. The delivery charges are increased from 30 to Rs 50. Overcharging will just loose customers. Stop using the situation to make profits.,1
"This food delivery app has everything that a good delivery app should have. The 'food quote bytes' should stay a bit longer to read, offers layout can be experimented with other than the horizontal layout and add uniform feedback option as well cuz very few delivery guys wear them.",5
Good app for ordering food fast with delivery. better than careem and deliveroo any day,5
"Do not use this app fake price ( Do not show the real price) restaurant Charges ( KFC, Dominos and Other most Of Restaurant do not charge this kind of charges but zomato does).",1
Services are good.. All restaurants are available here.. But little extra tax to pay!,4
"Everything was going good with zomato until last month . Since then 4 orders were late, and one delivered to wrong address. Not sure what is happening but it's bad and zomato need to fix whatever is going wrong with them.",1
Sit back and relax. Order will get in time. Excellent customer support💪.,5
It is good app it is good online Food Delivery app .it Delivers Fast and I love the app .Thank you Zomato,5
"Customer service is very bad. They never listen to your complaints or try to give any proper solution. They charge extra onthe price of the food and again take distance fee, delivery fee, service tax and all and take a huge amount of amount, which is unfair.",1
"very bad experience with the support team they canceled my order, my address was correct but they picked wrong location I didn't know how. the order was paid that's why they canceled my order if it would be cash on Delivery they would definitely come to delivered the order, I have request alot but they cut the call and cancelled the order I'm gone delete my account very bad experience with the zomato....!!!",5
"Never buy their ""pro"" membership if you are alone it's useless apart from overpricing the food items they ask you to order minimum 300rs or even more worth food to get discount. It's really annoying to buy so much of food. These cheap tricks by Zomato is annoying.",1
Not serious about their customers. Service is something not their cup of tea. I ordered food at 11.09pm and it has not been delivered till 12.30am and best part is they are not atall sorry about it. Though the food has to be delivered in 30 mins.,1
Very good ambience and courteous staff. The pizzas are fantastic and so is the pasta. The place is very neat and clean. My family being vegetarian and the staff helped us pick the right order and ensured the preference as per taste.,5
"Zomato indeeed a good app, the unicorn, but loosing its unqiueness. Just a food supplier app and very poor suggestions are advised. I am scared to try any new suggestion due to back to back bad experiences. Facing quality crisis.",1
There is no one responsible to attend to customers requests / complaints on the app.. One cannot even call the restaurant as the phone numbers are wrong. The cancelation policy is also very pathetic The Messages / replies are all cut n paste reply messages..,1
The service is pathetic... I had to call to Zomato and McDonald's repeatedly to confirm on that it took me 45 mins to sort it out and finally I came to know it is cancelled. It was sheer waste of time and also we were starving.,1
The experience has been ridiculous and disgusting with zomato.I ordered Paneer wrap and choc brownie from Mcdonalds via zomato but chicken wrap n soft drink was deliverd.I cud understand the chicken after tasting it as it was served to me in a plate after unpacking and then i asked for the packing and there it was....chicken wrap.I m vegetarian but because of zomato i tasted chicken which hurt my religious sentiments badly.Thereafter i raised issue on app via chat but no action for last 1 hour,1
Costlier than other apps. Should provide an option like swiggy super which saves a lot of money. Zomato pro is of no use for one guy as it is required to order a minimum of 300...500..600 but in swiggy super delivery fee is zero irrespective of order amount which saves 30 to 80 rupees every time.,2
Not at all good. Zomato chat is of no use.Better share some contact number where customers an connect,1
Have been using Zomato since last 1 year and have never faced any issue regarding delivery or be it anything. People who feel like it's worse can go to the restaurants themselves as Zomato isn't their slave. Whatever happened recently was just not at all your delivery guy's fault as I believe he was just doing his duty. It's been a really great experience using your service and hope this continues in the future too.,5
"Good App and have most of the restaurant listed. Customer service is also pretty good. Once I ordered Mutton curry but hotel sent chicken curry. I chatted with customer service,sent them photos and they immediately issued refund.. Deserve to get 5 star's for the exceptional customer service and amazing offers. One feedback,make us easy to see the review for food ordered by other customers so that we know will it be worth buying and need little improvement in your search engine.",5
Some of the discount coupouns wont work and the orders from restaurant are delayed then the time specified,1
Very good appt ... Problem solving for any order related issue is awesome ....,4
Feel cheated now-a-days when I am charged 75Rs as Delivery and 'Packing' charges in a 400Rs. Order. That too when the restaurant is just 4kms away. Isn't that unfair?,3
"Terrible experience, with over priced food and even so I wasn't able to place a order after trying multiple times and being debited twice. It was just done in a single click in Swiggy FYI.",1
"Worst experience, u ppl chat by msgs and waste time then say order is out for delivery and no refund , wrong address was selected i call within 5 min but u ppl kept asking silly questions and wasted 20 min then say its out for delivery so no refund. Pathetic.",1
The payment from Paytm was taken automatically without any confirmation from my side. This needs a check and review.,3
I think Zomato time runs differently wherever we see it will show 10 mins of delivery.,1
Very bad service!!!! i give an instruction for my location but not even follow!!!!! never use this app anymore!!!!,1
Zomato has very bad customer service. All they know is to speak or type rehearsed scripts. They take a big amount as service fee for using the app and also make money from the restaurants they service but customer service is zero. Have had several issues with them from time to time. No supervisor accountability as well.,1
"The best food delivery app in India. Loved the experience of order and delivery. If possible, you should reduce delivery charges for students because they are huge in number in universities and outside University area. So, you take less profit margin from them atleast which will give you good increase in number of orders. Because at the end, sasta khaana milega toh students daily order karenge. Think about it. 365 days permanent orders from loyal customers can increase your business alot.",4
"Now a day the offers and charges are horrible. 500 meter resutant Charing a distance fee. Nearest hotel with surge charge. Having a seperate menu for zomato order with higher price. Cheating customer in name of delivery, Taxes , surge charge, distance Fee.",1
User friendly great options... I would suggest pls start using Sodexo as pmt options that gives wide range to pay and is pocket friendly as well... Doing great job...,5
"This review is for promoting binging in your recent advertising. Everytime I see your ad, I will report it. You need to fire the person who allowed an ad to use the word binge as some normal and encouraged act.",1
"The old UI was so good, why do you insist on messing everything up? Who thought the new UI was a good idea? It's so horrible, can't fogure out where the photos are, where the menu is, what is this nonsense",1
"Worst service from a couple of days. Zomato has removed online chat section, so we can't talk to agents. This is so disappointing. I have received wrong food, and i have mailed about this 10 times to both pro@zomato and zomato customer care. No action has been taken. My Ticket ID is 7345468. How long do you need to contact me? Your customer care section is not responding to me. I cannot even talk to agents. This is worst service i have ever had. Shameless",1
Everything is fine but your most of the pblm is Timing. You guys always too late then your expected time... Then to hide your mistakes u people hold the timer so that u all can get some extra time for preparations,5
Everything is fine with this expect from the fact that zomato is the time scam you'll see. I have been watching the time of my delivery and it's been 5 mins and it's still showing 11 mins from 5 mins constant. And then you state that the delivery was in time. If you won't change the time it will show on time only. What is this scam? Can you please literally change this thing or make the time proper.,4
"When you open zomato app, if the internet signal is not good enough to connect, zomato displays a picture of graveyard. It's done in bad taste by the developers. Other food apps have a decent approach. But zomato choosed an offensive approach. I wonder that who would want to see graveyard when trying to buy food. It's very cheap and nasty approach of zomato. I complained this to zomato several times. They didn't take any action. I guess, zomato is fond of graveyard.",1
"Cannot contact delivery boy, waited for 3 hours for my order, called delivery boy 100 times, he neither picked the call nor delivered food But in the app it shows it is delivered , to whom, Pathetic customer care, u cannot call them and thier chat is off. Horrible experience. Uninstalling app, DUNZO is far better than u guys.",1
"Excellent service, delivery is arrived with in time",5
Not working But Experience not is nit accepted slow working Verry bad experience in my phone. But swiggy is working good in my phone how is it possible I Don't get ...??,1
"Splendid app , its an absolute master piece and during covid it has been very useful",5
User Friendly App. Delivery time is good. Provide different offers. Pro is also good. Smooth payment. Restaurant listing is also good with delivery menu. Pick up your order is also good to have. Poilte delivery guys. Awesome experience.,5
It is very good. we are enjoying it. Everything is given within time. Really I am loving it but sometime there is a problem in that offers as sometimes it shows something and the very next time it shows something else....... But ya its good,4
"It's getting worse day by day,they are now just focusing on money rather than services which they were offering sometime in the past, levying extra charges which on total gets as high as ₹90-₹100 ,atlast I want to tell you to improve your services,if you can.",1
"Minimum delivery time is 1hr. The pick up time for food is 45mins. Food Rates are too high when compared to direct purchase from hotel. Parcel quantity is too low, as for online order, quantity is provided less.",1
"The support system is very poor. I received a spoiled food and I tried to Coney the same to the Zomato support. They ask me to send a picture of the same, I did the same. But after that I didn't received any response from them.",1
Good service but sometimes ordered food is not being delivered,3
Wast of time and money. Plate iddly at varalakshmi tephens 35/- only. But zomato collect 89.50/- too expensive. I never use this app bye,1
Totally bad experience... Order jain food and received regular one inspite of mentioning the same. Further customer care executive asking me to treat order as an exception and let them serve me better in future... Totally slow and disappointing service provided. They even didn't called me and further providing no call services which leads to loss of money and time as wel.,1
It's a good app for use gives many offers and envolves all restaurants at last excellent service,5
"Everything is great 👍 I would've given the app 5* if not for two things. Firstly there should be an option for a paid or premium delivery for restaurants 20-25 km away, charge any thing (like I would be willing to pay 200-300, just to get delivery from my favorite restaurants ,). And secondly cod option should be raised to atleast rs1000 if not 1.5k",4
"With regards to service, I am happy with Zomato. But it is some notorious restaurant and their people, who just take customers for granted and ruin their experience. Can't say I haven't been a victim of such restaurant, however Zomato's customer service is always there to save your day. Thank you Zomato 😊.",4
I order at 7:45 and and at 8:32 rider marked delivered . And take food to his home. So it was a so bad experience they waste 2 hour in chat and not satisfied with it . They rate my time and Evening 125 rs rediculous servise.,1
App is crashing every time I open it since the last update. I haven't been able place orders for the past week because of this. My pro membership is getting wasted because of this. Refund my money.,1
"Worst very worst, always stupid ads in youtube. You people can't make us to buy food by showing these ads many times. There should be a positive impact. I am uninstalling these app. You people are spoiling your own business by showing ur ads this way.",1
"Very great app and food deliveries are on tym may be fast but overall experience with this app is good even customer care are helpful, on time refunds, employees are humble and always got my food delivered on tym @zomato should lower extra charges. And just a recommendation I think this delivery people's should be paid more. Thank you",5
Nice app for food delivery. During lockdown it's service amazing.,4
I had a lot of delicious food from Zomato a lot of times . Sometimes we may be dissapointed but they are doing their best . But the support team and delivery team are the best . If anything goes wrong than mostly the fault is the restuarants . I mean Zomato does not prepare food right ? They just take the order and deliver it us . I love Zomato . It always satisfies my cravings and whenever I am hungry . Hope everyone feels the same way . Respect delivery boys and be kind to them . # love dsp,5
"Delivery charge, taxes, packaging charges and additional high rate of food item as per restaurant menu and then missing /wrong orders. Service getting pathetic day by day. Have to go for other options for online food delivery now.",1
Worst location mapping issue every time location identification wrong..swiggy is 100% location identification..improve ur location mapping..everytime horrible to speak with rider..and guide to reach the location.. Very bad experience every time..,1
"My order was prepaid and after zomato canceled my order...they didn't refund it...in app they are showing its refunded but i didnt get the money....its been a week...they old me to wait for 5 days....and today when i was about to raise my complain again...they removed the ""support"" option from my app. SWIGGY IS MUCH BETTER THAN ZOMATO",5
Not one experience has been seamless. Sometimes the food comes delivered badlym at other times despite choosing an outlet close by it comes from far off. Result is always a delay. Really sad !,2
"It was good, fast delivery with keeping all safety precautions in mind.",5
"Excellent food, food delivered before delivery time by delivery boy great service #had good experience with Zomato 👍",5
I found cockroaches from the order and attached screen shots but no action from zooma or from Chandan restaurant....,1
"Did not delivered yet and it's showing delivered. Da updated no is switched off, after 45 mints DA called me and asked me share the live location on whatsApp. Food is totally waste and cold. I m not satisfied with service. I want my refund.. customer care no is not reachable",3
The food is always delivered hot and at time. The delivery boys take nice care of hygiene.,5
"Already price of restaurent are much more higher than initial and then delivery charged implied ,,,such a worst service no offer giveb to cust ..day by day ur service getting worst .. I think some new food del conpany should be start by someone or else swiggy would be better ....than zomato .. Who the hell will order minimum of 300 rs order for 1 person r u guyZz are fool or stupid one who create day by day loss to company ,,, fact but true..",1
"My pro membership is not working properly. Whenever I used to order food , my pro membership doesn't utilize.",1
Zomato service has worsened. They assigned multiple orders to delivery valent and it delay the order delivery and you end up eating cold food even after paying delivery charges. Online chat representative not available for any feedback for live order. Very bad experience.,1
App is too good n easy to use...But the issue m getting is m unable to give ratings to the zomato valet..It is only taking food review...,3
I order selected dish but send me other dish. I inform zomato and restaurant but no any positive response. I suggest to customers not use zomato use any other food delivery app.,1
the chat is a chatbot and there is no option to cancel a duplicate order.,1
It would be better if you guys provide free delivery on order ₹99. We don't want extra offers. Also keep the menu prices same as dine in menu's. Hope zomato works on this. This is very much needed.,1
Worst app to order food!!!!Zomato is scamming people. I order a lot from Zomato and they charge me rs 40 to 60 for delivery from a place that is like 10 min distance on a bike . I used to think that it's normal but one day I noticed that my friend using same coupon code was getting the food for like 40 to 50 rs cheaper than me from same place and same delivery address . Why are you scamming people like this Zomato .,1
One of the useless app trying to place order but showing something went wrong try again later. It take one hour to place order and then one hour to deliver the food... Worst experience,1
The customer chat service is very poor ....I've been chatting with them all evening and they aren't even responding,2
"The worst service ever , after waiting 2-3 hours it's showing order delivered but I did't received the order , online support take minimum 1 hour to assist you , and just a sorry for everything, if someone made a order he need food not apologies and promo discount code... no words to explain feelings 🤬🤬🤬",1
"The riders are clueless as to what to do and what not to do. Inspite of reminding every now and then, they still don't have the understanding to not to ring the doorbell during odd/ hours. There might be someone sick inside or whatever. Request Zomato to train their employees a-wee-bit better. Thanks.",1
Very bad experience... And food packaging is not in manner... Even i ordered something and i received something different... Very irresponsible,1
Very fast delievery app and discout all year is also a good reason to order food,5
Everything fine ..but if u make it available for middle class people.. try to decrease delivery charges it will be more good..,5
First impression is best impression but Zomato proved that in lockdown they provide bad food with bad taste quality...first time i have ordered and faced the issue...if there are negative rating then i will give but we don't have,1
having Great experience since 2018 and recommend to many friends very reliable platform .....,5
"So much taxes and bla bla charges are added recently and on top of it for supporting valet. Ideally as they are working for Zomato, you should be compensating them properly and not burdening customers with this. 😠😡🤬 Too clever to take all profits from the shops and pushing customers to tip the valets. 😡 Update : Most of the good restaurants have switched to the other delivery aggregator and most of the time restaurants are not available for delivery these days. No use of buying PRO!! 😞😞",1
The customer service is very poor if we have any issues means they won't reply back the will that too much time and they don't understand our position with the order and they don't read full conversation. they do on their own assumption,1
"Leaving Zomato for unprofessional and irresponsible behaviour. No appropriate action irrespective to whatsoever issue. Special appeal to all the vegetarians out there stop relying on Zomato, otherwise you will end up eating non-veg.",1
Worst so far because zomatos refund policy is very bad and this app is very clever in terms of timing.. How much ever time it might take for the order to come the time still shows the same.. Very bad customer service. They never refund my money in case of food being bad.,1
Zomato serves to be a great service in ordering and delivering food. One thing that lacks here is the return or repayment policy. It has happened many a tomes that i recieved wrong order. But there's no way to return and get the correct order back. Zomato should work on this,5
"I would deduct one star because we haven't been delivered exact same thing at least once in last five times, something always goes wrong with packaging or food quantity. Otherwise it is best.",4
Very bad at management restaurants are taking more then 1 hour to prepare a order but Zomato doesn't take any action against restaurant's .,1
"Pizza arrived after 2 hours. Dont use this app for food, they have very poor customer support for delivery follow up or issues. Get your food online direct from the establishments that have proper fleet for deliveries.",1
Very good food delivery app. It has probably saved a lot of lives as well as restaurant business by delivering food during these tough Covid times. My complete respect to the delivery boys.They face a lot of hardships to deliver the food to us on time.,5
The food got cold by the time it was delivered. You should strictly stick to 45 minutes delivery time. You took 75 minutes to deliver the food and hence the rating. Never ever gonna order from you guys again.,1
The problem is the person has to remain hungry for and hour nor 2 before the food gets delivered and the food would come cold .. it happened so with my recent orders. The food was ordered from a location which is merely 2 mins away but they delivered the order in next 1 hour .. I got late for work and had brunch instead of breakfast,1
"This is my go-to place. Can go anyday and still enjoy each and every minute spent out there. Food, drinks, service and staff - in one word EXCELLENT. I think,.I have tried almost everything here and each and every item in the menu is simply too good.",5
"fall from grace....pro sucks, delivery from rigga to muraqqabat is AED 7. r u delivering in a limo? EDIT: Copy past response not even addressing the problems. Shows how bad it is. Perfectly summarises the app's state.",1
"The charges are already more comparing to menu card of same restaurant. On top, Zomato is charging additional service charges, delivery charges and later forcing to pay tips as well. Is Zomato not giving salaries to their employees. If yes, then why forcing tips and if no, then why service charges ? Best part is, if the order gets delayed, their watch stopped working.",1
Very good application and fast and safe delivery,5
Horrible very embarrassing experience. Please check with restaurant AND delivery boy on the time of delivery. Information given is wrong and misleading. I had great difficulty in handling 15 guests kept waiting for over 1hr.30mins. Not reliable at all.,1
"Even though I didn't placed order, as I only added to cart, the order has been placed, and delivered, there is a loop hole in app",1
"Zomato is better than Swiggy in terms of customer friendly and with minimal delivery time. Most good thing I find in Zomato is if the order got delayed, they immediately work in out and give additional offers for the customers and made them happy. Customers getting a feel they Zamota take care of their customers",5
Cool n smooth service quality. Deserves more than 5 stars.,5
Too many taxes and hefty delivery charges. On top of that packaging charges. The coupons doesn't make sense coz we any way end up paying more due to the taxes and delivery charges and packaging charges.,1
Very bad experience they are never up to the mark when it comes to delivery . Always show 1 hours to deliver then also they become late I think you should work on fast and garunteed on time delivery like Domino's does then you can grow much better if your customer is hungry and you're delivering him after 1 hour then what's the meaning of your service he/she can go to nearby places to eat something so do think about that 👍👍.,2
"I'm having a good experience using Zomato... They were having good customer service team compared to those at Swiggy who won't even properly respond after posting a grievance. When it comes to Zomato, they're responding properly and attending the grievance in a proper way which makes me happy even if I have a bitter experience with the restaurant",5
"Customer support do one thing only : Apologize !!, Never been able to recive any timely/support on any of the reported issues Prefer to order directly from the the Resturant than use this useless service 1 star is too much, whish less rating was available",1
"Always have been great experience, even if sometime I have faced issues with quality or delivery bcoz of reastaurant, Zomato has always made sure that I'm never left unsatisfied, great customer service, superb App.",4
Zomato is doing great 👍.... Everytime I have got resolution... professional executive staff 👍👍100stars to Zomato and the delivery agents,5
maintain same price as mentioned in restaurant menu. Taking more time than given expected time frame. Service fees are high. Not giving offers. Previously Zomato offer great discount.but now reduced.,2
Delivery executives are sometimes drunk and wont come to deliver your order and customer service will refuse to cancel your order and refund your money. Moreover they also hike up prices of items and then levy unreasonable amount of extra charges as well. Extremely shady. Only order from Zomato when I have no other options.,1
Swiggy is cheaper and better. Fed up with late delivery. This was my last order.,1
Well made. Love the live-tracking of delivery.,5
It is very good app and very safe with Covid-19 situation this is very good app for food eating in home they are giving food on the time,5
Becoming miserable. Zomato does not have a customer care number. Had an experience where I received a wrong order and all I could do was chat with a bot which was repeating the same things again and again. I am even unable to find the mail id to send the complain. Very poor customer service. Update: I sent mail with all my concerns to the above mail ID.. but still no reply from them... Worst response. Update2: I have not received a reply/ticket ID. The chatbot doesn't help in this regard either.,1
"Useless. Walk to your restaurant and eat there or get the food yourself. asked for a ketchup at a restaurant for extra 5rs. didn't receive it. got 5rs refunded. I had to go out to get my own ketchup. If I had to do that, I can very well get my own food. why do you exist here?",1
"Giving one star because every time you try to order something, first they proceed and after that show you need to add more food worth 100,200 etc. Why ?? You can charge only for delivery. If there's one person why need extra food. Getting worst everyday.",1
delivery person cancelled my order and refund was not issued after 10 days of wait and chat person was not able to answer queries and place me on hold without any answer.. ridiculous service do not ever order from Zomato.. service is not at all good but give us hassle.,1
Nice app to place order and very accurate about remaining timing to deliver,5
"I love Zomato ....everytime when I had some issue, Zomato customer support help me. They took care of my issue in every possible way and I am satisfied with their help and support. They really care for their customers that's the reason I always give preference to Zomato while ordering food online. Thank you.",5
"Beautiful restaurant with an excellent view.... awesome staff....Dance floor is awesome,good for photoshoot...rooftopview👌🔥.... entire setup is prefect.... awesome staff....The over all experience was just perfect... Enjoy with family and Friends...",5
Worst app Uninstalled because it disturbs a lot while logging in. Whenever I'm logging in using OTP then unnecessarily asking for email OTP. also no OTP was sent on email till. Totally bogus developers. Still no improvement. No resolution yet.,1
"App is working good, I use it regularly and never faced any problem.",5
Average. Sometimes there is excessive delay and delivery charges. Also the prices shown in the app are higher than the actual prices in the restaurants.,3
Worst service they don't follow their delivery timelines. They cancelled order after 40 mins saying bike issue...silly reasons....delivery company shud not say this...,1
"Was having issue with missing delivery, customer support was Horrible in resolving",1
The customer service is really bad. I got a wrong order and I complained about it. I sent around 3 photos and the chat support said it was difficult to validate the image. I tried to take many and used the zomato app to click the photo for live image. But I recieved really bad responses.,1
Now a days very bad experience. Charging too much delivery charges. So this is time to change our mindset for ordering on App. My suggestions to all reader minimize ordering through app.,2
This is very good app and very helpful to purchase any food items,5
Worst app I had ordered the food and I had received a insect on that food Zomato didn't helped me in that case they don't care about their customers they just need money after that they don't care about their customers,1
"I ordered chicken biryani. Chicken quality very poor,pieces was very short and very less quantity. Rice quality nice and testy but oily.",1
"There is no extra facility you will get even if you are a pro member. Don't waste your money by subscribing for pro. Swiggy is far better. I will cancel my pro membership. I am updating this review on 24.02.2021..... I have ordered 1.2 kg biriyani with 2 pcs chicken. I received around 800gm biriyani and 1 pc chicken. I am regretting for using Zomato now. ......... After posting this review, I got an email from them and explained the problem I faced. I haven't received anything from their end",1
Worst UI ever. You might as well drop bunch of button all over the screen.,1
"Good application and service, although ""not so great"" category. Needs improvement in user experiences. It would be cool if it comes with a dark theme.",3
Good and fast service. Better than other food delivery apps,5
I ordered 1st time and its delay for 20 min.. even I am not happy with that portion size and quality...,1
Has amazing offers and discounts going on throughout !,5
"Delivery estimates are misleading. Delivery time off by 1hrs. Valets do not respond to your calls. In city limits they are out of range, if the delivery is delayed.",2
Bug in the Promo code area. when tried to apply promo code for domino's the message displays ok ok twice Promo codes are not valid for domino's orders ok ok,3
Worst app ever!! Most disrespectful customer service...the delivery driver delivers to the wrong address and then has the audacity to tell us to go around our neighbor's and check if any of them received our order...i was charged for this and zomato's response upon complaint is you will receive a refund in 7days...what a joke...they couldn't even get the driver to call and apologise for his rude behaviour...please dont encourage this app...they are the worst!! Cancelling my subscription also!!,1
"I wish there was a zero rating option. My amount is stuck with zomato since more than a month. They keep passing on responsibility & the same mail is copy pasted and sent without even checking the background or historical conversation. I have been writing to the team since 5th feb. Pathetic customer service, obnoxious taxes & delivery charges. JUST PATHETIC!!",1
"I am using this app more than 2yrs but now they changed the customer policies.Like delivery chaeges,minimum 100rs order,linked to unhygenic resturants,no customer concerns check...Simple 30rs food costing 80rs including 40rs tax..!!...Go and eat if possible...",1
"My previous rating to Zomato was 1 but now I wish to rate you guys as 5. Really awesome improvement and Zomato is far better than swiggy in all ways. Problem with swiggy is they make the delivery guys to deliver more orders at a time which is difficult for both delivery guy and customer have to wait for long time. Whereas swiggy just keep increasing the ETA. For the past 6 orders, I felt the same. Whereas Zomato doesn't do that often as swiggy and also the customer service is much better. Kudos.",5
Now days valet having multiple orders. So thats why it will take longer time and food get cold. Pathetic services,1
"Its a genuine app for food loves..variety of foods are available in one platform according to your choice, also food and charges are fine with good home delivery service..",4
This is very good app.but their is one promble they didn't provide cash on delivery,3
"Hi zomoto, App is good and easy to access a our favourite food, i need small improvement in map because if i click a map its not come full screen ,it was in compact size.if i double tap a map should come full screen its feel good and much better.",4
The app is good with regards to food delivery. But there should be an open chat system where customers can put forward their grievances. The set questions in the chat box do not address my payment related query.,4
My app keeps stopping and I have send so many feedbacks but it's still the same nevertheless the prices are hiked purposely so much that even after any coupon code it's still highers than the price at which it is sold in the actual resturant. Very disappointed,1
Great delivery but the restaurant chain doesn't match their standards...,4
Why there is no option for 'I have not received my order'. There surely is for 'I have received my order'. Its known fact that they want you to go throught the long route.,1
"A very bad experience with Zomato. The box for the meal is delivered fully open with some of the meal portion missing. The ridiculous behaviour from customer service representative was to ask me for accepting the same. And, shamelessly putting blame on restaurant.",1
Pathetic... They don't even bother to answer your concerns.. food is never delivered on time always have to wait .. the delivery guy will not answer call. Not writing comment after one time experience I have faced this issue many times .. better to uninstall the app,1
It is very convenient way to order food. The delivery staff are well mannered... The only point I have to mention is the additional charges for the delivery is sometimes as much as the order itself,4
Timely food delivery . Delivery boy is following all covid appropriate behaviour.,5
Very poor delivery service. I was waiting for food since one hour. You should know that you have to deliver the order within 30 min. This is ridiculous. I hope my feedback will help others. Bad service.,1
Had a perfect Sunday lunch after a quite a long time. From the City of Madurai to the comfort of our house. Take away from Madurai saradha mess located in Anna Nagar made our weekend great. Unlike huge restaurants which charge a great fortune for nothing 😏 they have a very reasonable pricing. . . . . Items bought: 1. Chettinad chicken curry 2. Chicken chukka 3. Mutton chukka 4. Coir fish curry 5. Pomfret curry 6. Sardines fry . . . . All the dishes tasted soo homely without any artificia,4
all good ..but the only problem is that there is large difference between the rate list at restaurent and the rate list on zomato ..it seems costly by ordering through zomato,3
Orderd icecream from creamstone and it got delivered but it icecream was melted i i contacted to Zomato but the answer they gave was not satisfactory. this was my first order in Zomato and worst experience so please don't order in zomato even though i mailed to zamato customer support i am not getting any reply from zomato customer support.my ticket id was 7901166,1
Most times will commit 30 minutes to deliver and the order will arrive after an hour. Will try to fulfill 2/3 deliveries (when only one is possible) and save costs. Money matters more than honouring commitments to customers.,1
Executive and call centre always tell lie regarding the delivery boy temperature and services. Not following any discipline of covid measures.,1
"Really love the menu, specially amazing packing and food taste very delicious and upto mark. Love the flavors and like all the items which I have tried. Love the Yakhni Dum Ghost Biryani very tasty and yummy. Love the Murgh Makhani texture and taste. Love the sweets Lacha Rabdi very yummy and delicious. All the items were well packed and very well presented.",5
"Worst app ever, charges twice on the same order and even cancels order immediately as soon as online payment is done. There is no proper provision for refund policy as it is pending for ages.",1
"I see only a handful restaurants on zomato for delivery. And it's not because of the restaurants, swiggy shows more than 10 times the restaurants as shown on zomato. Much disappointment.",1
"The only issue I feel is to not able to schedule the orders, other wise everything is extremely good",5
"Very nice app. Useful app, it delivers food in a very short period of time when compared to remaining food apps.And even almost there are so many so many hotels in Zomato.Its a nice app but the rates are costly when compared to the actual price at the hotel that is why I have given 4 stars otherwise you may get 5stars. So please see that. And there are so many notifications.",4
"There is a big in your app. Everyone you refresh, you will get different status of restaurants (open/closed). Please look into this as soon as possible. Also add Dark Mode.",1
"It is an amazing app, I actually love the service they give, if there is a problem with your order they help us and make it clear and also if we had a problem with the food it will be reviewed through zomato chat and will take care of it",5
Very good application there always a promo code and my order experience is also very good i am using zomato since 3 years and I never get disappointed regarding to there service. And whenever my food comes in bad condition or something is missing then they refund my money and help me out. Amazing service . I just wana to say WOW 👏,5
"I ordered the food but they give less and open food. No packaging is there. I wanted to give 0 star but it's not possible so I had to give 1. Now I got why they are giving offer, just to fool us as they take out icecream etc before we recieve.",1
Zomato customer care I have no words to describe. Neither they r helpful nor ale to solve a problem its like ur taking to a machine. Also Zomato adds any restaurant in he network even without doing a check on hem and lets the customer suffer for it.,1
It was nice ordering with zomato and the food deliver on time...👍,5
"Given order from Kabuliwala on 15.04.2021.I had make the advance payment of amount Rs.1925.30.My 6 years old little child ,my old mother and my wife was eagerly waiting for the foods ( Biriyani and Mutton Chaap) to celebrate that day.But we hadn't received our delivery and the delivery person was very rude and continuously telling lie and he cheted us .We hadn't received our delivery, I lost my money and already make complaint to Zomato .They said that will do the necessary actions.",1
Their service is not at all good nowadays.... I dnt knw why the hell they behaving like this.... First of all they have not send me my refund even after 3 days of order cancelation.... N d very next order i ordered was missing some items.... They have not gave me the compensation of that order..... I have tried so hard to tell them.... They just gave me an email id n told me to send complaint on email.... But not at all responding to my mail....,1
"Donno why all Food delivery apps charging extra amount from menu card amount, despite charging Service and handling charges. I ll happily Service and handling charges, but why should I pay extra amount than which is mentioned in the menu card? Hoping for the reply.",1
"Good service by the zomato person and on time ,all the food wr neatly packed",5
Its over 45 minutes when i placed my order bht still restaurant not accepting order... Its horrible.. Very bad service..... I think worst.. Really,1
Sometimes foods are tasty and sometimes it is not... In maximum cases prices are not acceptable...these are very high. I request to reduce prices of foods.,3
Could be a way better in terms of delivery charges and additional taxes,4
App is very user friendly and delivery time acceptable.,4
Not at all satified with the service try to.improve the serivce or its better to close the app is what I feel,1
"The first thing is COD is not available... I know it's for safety purpose but since long time no availability for cash on delivery is available, I live alone in my home and I was not feeling well so I thought that I should order something but when my order was ready and at last When I have to add payment method It showed that cash on delivery is not available...due to some reason I can't pay online bit I was very disappointed.....",1
I have ordered alot from zomato but sometimes my order is incomplete and when I chat they always use to apologise only no action been taken same time and they react like they don't care yes maybe that's right because it's my food not them and most of the times the food is cold if I message customer service they don't respond it's the worst experience because u take our money before u deliver so u need to prior us not making us fool like this.,2
Very bad service. Can't even provide a driver to to deliver the order and then they will not do anything until you complain. The food comes too cold and old already.. Not really useful app and very bad customer service.. Always will and always will be..,1
It is good app lots of discounts and fast delivery. It is good I loved it❤️,5
"Before ordering Initial delivery time is 30mins, after ordering delivery time is 40mins. Food delivered after 1hr, that for 1km distance. Due to clubbing of delivery routes. Even there is no option to cancel the order. Never order pizza's from ZOMATO app.",1
"Pathetic service, I am ordering from Zomato as pro member every alternate day and experienced almost always late delivery, customer service executive are not capable to understand and solve your problems, every time they apologize for their worst service and force you to consider all incidents as isolated incident, when they can't answer they ask you to write a feedback or may repeatedly ask you to eloborate your query without understanding it.and finally you end up with no solution",1
"Went with great expectations. The food is overpriced, as compared to the quantity as well as quality and did not like the experience. they didn't have many Kerala basic dishes like idiyappam, puttu, coconut water, ghee roast was not as per the normal preparation. The waiters were not able to tell about the type of preparation or any recommendations. Waiters hesitant and slow to respond.Total let down",1
Used to be great but now they have absolved all their duties and responsibilities. You order through Zomato pay to Zomato but anything goes wrong with your order they won't bother anymore. Would say sorry in a friendly chat and you are left to yourself to deal with a wrong order.,1
Horrible service experiences in recent past.. have included horrible restaurants whom even their support team is not able to contact forget about customers contacting them...never thought such splendid start will reach in such pathetic condition for Zomato...make the changes or downfall is near if not started already...,1
"Making fool to customers, increased price on Zomato app and after that giving discount. One dish on Zomato app is inr 130 and if you order from restaurant then price is 80. I checked price of other restaurants, same issue was there. Seriously shameful. Now, delivery charges is also too high...",1
Total disappointment. Its better to hand pick your orders rather than paying almost 30-35% more on your food bill. Not at all worthy and the coupons are just a consolation. I will never prefer online ordering from Zomato to anyone. Uninstalling....,2
"No exciting offer , no great discounts , highly additional charges after adding food in cart , this makes more likely to pick up food from the restaurant. I'm disappointed with your application services.",1
"Very bad experience I had with them. Full order was not provided, spillage was there in the curry, broken packet, once received whole food packet fall on the street, they are saying it's not there issue sorry, I'm sorry to order with you...",1
"I ordered the food but the delivery man did not deliver, and I was waiting so much but still he didn't come to deliver my food and his mobile number out of service. This was the very bad movement for me that i have ever faced. And I slept with out getting the food just because of the delivery man Fault, Zomato has not a good service.",1
"One of the apps Best avoidable except when nothing is available their arrogance needs to be taught a lesson who cheated customers with Gold membership & from 1+1 free dish they have now reduced it to 15/20 % off and they say this is it accept it or forget it , and even when suggested to waive off delivery charges which is now 57 Rs for 1.5 kms maybe they deliver in a Mercedes",1
"Extremely poor customer service. Also wrote an email to the ID provided. No resolution. Here is the ticket ID : 7447349 Earlier, these idiots said, please share me your ticket ID, we will look at it with highest priority. But no convincing solution.",1
I don't know what is the problem.i have been using Zomato since years but suddenly it says not delivering to your address.i don't understand!,5
I wasnt able to place an order over 750 for pay on delivery on one device and the same thing occured on the other except the limit was only 350 rupees. So my first experience wih Zomato was upseting. I am utterly dissapointed by this feature. Horrible !,1
"Horrible, take ages to complete a transaction. Swiggy is way better!",1
"Updating review post 5 years of online ordering. Been a loyal zomato customer for almost 4+ years. Zomato delivery experience has been worst since few years. Once you order, you are trapped. You won't be able to reach customer support, delivery guy will refuse to deliver without the extra money outside zomato, he'll neither cancel the order not deliver. God bless zomato.",1
As compared to swiggy i like the service of zomato as swiggy delivery boys dont deliver to the door step faced lots of issue with swiggy hence have switched to zomato and is enjoying the hassle free service.,5
A very nice App also the delivery is too fast at least in mumbai,5
This app is really wonderfull and very helpfull. It also provides certain offers which helps us to save money to a great extend and maximum times we get order within time or before time limit its a wonderfull and fentabulous app and it should remain immortal for years works like this only Thank you.,5
They will not help you when you have any problems . I had a issue with my order and I asked for the help but I didn't get the revert from Zomato .,1
"Always reliable! Whenever I want to order in food, I check others for comparison but in the end, I'd still go back to Zomato. I hope they would give out discount reward vouchers via email to certain customers who truly supports this app.",5
Awesome App . As I work in rotational shifts. Sometimes I don't have time to cook and this app provides food even late nights also . That is really great.,4
"Today while ordering, there was some technical glitch. Money deducted from account. Customer support chat initiated. Information received from CS "" It will take 5 to 7 days for refund"". Don't use this app. Update - 6th March payment failed. 8th March received intimation of ""refund initiated"", expected completion date given by Zomato, 15th March 2021. 9 day? Are you JOKING or snowballing interest on failed payments???",1
I ordered my first order from the app and didn't receive any offers but All my friends recived offers on their first order that's why I gave 2 stars,2
Why pricing of zomato menu and restaurant direct menu is different. Please be transparent. With dual pricing somewhere you are cheating customers and on top of increased priced menu restaurants charge us delivery charge. An explanation required from Zomatos Managment. Still waiting for any response from. Zomato team.,3
They don't check and verify the restaurants just add any restaurant to there menu if they give commission.. order at your own risk,1
Zomato app improved with tracking and estimated delivery time showing.,4
All over it's good but need to train about service delivery boy if customer facing any issues with ordering then they can assist rtr then call to customer care as its take so much time writing a msg and get reply from customer care,4
They generally sell costly and then give discount...Also after giving the discount it is costlier than the restaurant... Check pizza hut cost directly online...and them check zomata cost of pizza hut... Try checking pasta veg or non veg...huge difference in rates....,1
The experience is good but sadly Zomato is charging nowadays at a very high rates coz of which I tend to uninstall this app,2
"You should make a survey of food,test, hygiene etc by your own. Then only allow the food delivery on your flatform. Regarding the delivery boys, few of them ask the address from 2 km away. How do expect to guide, even if the correct location is addressed.",3
"I ordered two sandwiches almost an hour ago, the order was supposed to be delivered within 40 mins now its been a hour the order has gone from On the way to preparing, The rider told he has two orders in queue once I get the second order I will deliver yours, My order is ready since last half n hour... Pathetic service.. The rider is taking in a rude way and I spoke to Chintala I guy from the Order support he was a dumbass was not able to help me.. I guess SSC pass student on chat support...",1
"The app is kind of a fraudulent one, the arriving time changes in an irregular manner like a while ago it was showing 7 minutes to arrive and now it's showing 9 minutes to arrive, so that the estimated time is never ending. #Scam",1
"It's great to have my order at zomato as it gives me huge list of restaurant to taste food at the most reasonable good value. all my orders have discount that isn't possible to grasp otherwise . also i'm impressed with the way these people deliver it to us , at the very safety of our house , we get immense pleasure while enjoying food of different restraunts . also the quality of food we get is highly appreciable lastly , it saves my time and money sync , and we get to enjoy the meal at rest .",5
"1st time ,,I ordered today and relieved fast and taste was superb ..thank u Zomato as lockdown in pune but no matters ,,Zomato here",4
"I've ordered Food today from Sharjah through a Dubai Based restaurant ""Shadab"". And even before ordering confirmed from the restaurant if they're delivering to Sharjah. They did confirmed that orders above AED 50/- can be delivered. Zomato did charged my card, and later they've requested cancellation, and upon shouting on the Zomato rep, I get the answer that my card shall be refunded within 5 to 7 business days!! PATHETIC EXPERIENCE 1/10.",1
"Worst experience . Once I ordered cake and after getting order we realized that cake was rotten and it is expensive. So immediately we had contacted with customer support with proof we had sent every detail, but they didn't refund.",1
"I am giving 3 stars because delivery boys are not in uniform maximum time when they reach me with my food,,, i seen them in unhygienic normal clothes and some time with uniform also...but food is well packed that is plus point but still zomato need to improve so much in hygiene in india.",3
The app is very good. You can choose a variety of foods and u even get crazy discounts by using coupon codes . 😜.u can also track down your food .in over all the app is great 👍,5
Worst delivery exp. Order late by more than 1 hr. No response from.restaurant. zomato customer support also not able to contact restaurant. Asked for cancellation but they refused and said on cancellation no refund will be done. Horrible expirence. once more time very bad expirence today. zomoto do not even bother to reply.,1
Very high delivery charges...zomato prices are mismatch the resturant menu...,1
Very good delivery right at time very quick response. I converted now into summa semma zomato.🥰,5
The behaviour of delivery person was very nice and delivery was on time..liked it..,5
Worst customer support and my chat function is now working when i reported no action also major issue there was a order which i did not place and ordered for some different location when reached zomato no actiom i lost 2800rs. So do not use zomato and go for swiggy which is better in all the means,1
In case of my emergency why would the app deny cash on delivery... ???For which I had to order in a very delayed process... We need to add card and pin n all which took as a long time. .bcos there was no cash on delivery,3
"You order food, delivery time is shown and then delivery guy have 2, 3, 4 orders and you get your food cold, 30 minutes late. Increase delivery guys working per hour during dinner time or dont show your delivery times. Seriosuly bad service.",1
fast delivery and very good option to select the food,5
Very easy to use and comes in handy. The delivery executives are v polite and the overall service is exceptionally well as well.,5
I am facing problem since months whenever I am opening zomato application. It keep on loading till I get to see the home page. Tried Uninstalling and installed again still facing the same issue where I need to wait for minutes to open the app,2
"Sir app was really nice but food order review space was only 50 letters that was not enough for review please provide the 500 letters space, some resturents are provide items some are not good some are good. if you are not provide space I am saying all that are bad........",3
Very bad app. Food was always in spoiled condition and the order was late for about 1 and a half hour. Such a time wasting and money sucking app. And even after using helping section they won't help by giving such a rubbish excuse..such a worst app.,1
"Bad experience with this application, Zomato should understand the importance customer, When you accepting order don't behave like a delivery platform only shoud take concern about restaurants. I have order briyani from briyani by kilo no response from the restaurant, no order received , it take 2 hours to understand Zomato . Please behave like a good businesses Don't behave like a my duty is Delivery Still have patience After not receiving order and all this blunders.",1
"When You are paying the delivery charges and taxes. Its better to go to the restaurant directly and get the food. The quantity is always very less than what you get at the restaurants. The discounts are a gimmick, as the quantity is reduced by the restaurant as per the amount paid by you. The Zomato Customer Care says they have no control over the restaurant over the quantity and the restaurant says what will they earn if they will give full quantity and Commission to Zomato.",1
"Restaurants' details and food quantity details are not available. Duplicate restaurants are there with the same name of renowned restaurants. Too much surge charge, delivery charge and taxes.",1
"The app is poorly built. The search results, specifically if searching for a cuisine, never show correct information. Listed restaurant almost always do not serve the dish searched!",3
"The customer service is terrible except the pro team. Zomato prefers to issue refunds in the form of a coupon so that at the end of the day, the money is theirs and you can't use any other offer. They manipulate ratings and remove reviews that I assume restaurants ""complain"" about. The service is deplorable. I've been asked to make a ""one time exception"" 7.5/10 times. All in all- Shady af Business Zomato PRO is a scam. The discounts only apply above a threshold that's kinda ridiculous. NOPE",1
Super service ever keep it up keep going the best food delivery ever,5
zomato service is very fast with good attitude staff. like order taker and delivery boy.. thanks Zomato..,4
"My overall experience was excellent but I need to uninstall your app because I don't want to give business to the company who don't care about their employees. Like since last 5 days,one Instagram model put allegation on your hardworking employee. Please listen to both side of story then take actions. I know your riders, they are very calm and compose. That Instagram model did it for public sympathy. She gain 15000 plus followers on Instagram. Sorry zomato but you lost your one more customer.",1
Taking time to locate the restaurant or an item. Search option is not so efficient. Needs improvement!,4
"Honest advice, just use Talabat. Their service is way better. My order is always late through zomato (same restaurant) but on time through talabat. Today an order got automatically cancelled without any reason. Restaurant say it's from Zomato's side.",1
Awesome 👍 I loved it.. it's a best app to order in this covid situation.. thank you Zomato. Good service 👍,5
"So basically if your order goes wrong in some manner they offer you a token money like 50-100 bucks as a compensation. For me this is equivalent to giving a kid wanting a toy, a sweet to shut him up. I mean if you messed up the order have to guts to return the full amount or none. Your 75 bucks wont fix my 700 rupees order, will it?",1
"I was about to give you the 5 stars.. But not done the same because continuous improvement is also very necessary.. 😉 This app is too good, easy to operate and also got the best offers time to time.. Keep doing great.. Thank you Zomato 😃😃",4
Live tracking and current order unable to track easily..,4
Each every time I order they are showing the wrong delivery time they show 20 min or 25 min but it always take half an hour more even sometime it take a complete 1 hour . This is not the right thing. This is completely unacceptable.,1
Your app is shown all the hotels list. After placing the order it's appear not delivery in your area. It's really irritating. But other related app shown only delivery hotel list.,1
"Had a great experience using Zomato. Doorstep delivery, safe and genuine. App is easy to use with simple interactive interface.",5
So many interruption in payment methods please recovery that and why it is necessary necessary to pay online not offline please every time we can't pay online we have to pay sometime offline 2 There is a problem in your in your security that after cancellation any food cannot get cash on delivery they said only pay online but we can't pay online in that case what we can do with don't have any option please solve this,2
"The app is great till the time restaurant and delivery guys work in unison. However problem starts when you have a trouble with delivery guy or with your order. Zomato doesn't take any responsibility whatsoever, restaurant may help you out.....but Zomato definitely won't.",3
Very easy to use! Swift delivery! Except when ordering in Dubai area,3
For a few months very selective items are diplayed in the app. Items we used to purchase are not being shown for reason unknown to me. Even repeat orders are getting inactive.,1
Zomato is my Favorite app for food delivery service is good and also the best discounts👍,5
Wrong order. Instructions not passed on to the restaurant. Order was 35 mins late. Tracking does not work . Had to pick up the order myself after waiting outside the restaurant for 20 mins . Classic Zomato Service . Such a DISGRACE . Where can I rate in negative stars ?,1
Zomato is although good but the price of food items are quite high aftr adding them to your cart.. Cost adds up to a lot including delivry charges and gst.. I would rather prefer dining out which is quite cheaper than ordering on zomato.,2
"The app is alright but the customer service and zomato valets are awful. First a zomato valet sends me lewd whatsapp messages. When I report this to zomato, the guy just sends sorry mistake. And zomato doesn't take any relevant action. Other times that I order, despite correct location and route being shown on the app, the delivery executives don't have a clue how to reach the location. Today the valet didn't deliver the order and zomato just canceled the order without my consent. 😞 not done.",1
"Great app with all the possible discount coupons available every time we place any irder big or small. Reasonable prices for every food item. Easy to access with many important features for tracking order, food handling, msg/calling restraurant and/or delivery etc",5
Best app for delivery and always accurate but bit expensive!,5
Great app for food ordering. Fast delivery too.,5
"I have ordered my food and the order is not complete, one item was missing and when i complained about it i haven't got any reply from them. I have paid for the entire food and now zomato is not even replying to my query. WORST EXPERIENCE.",1
Service is fine and complaint resolved immediately.,5
"Pathetic on delivery schedule, has happened umpteen times now where order takes not just few minutes but almost an hour extra to dleiver v/s initial committed time schedule.... Add to that price charged is way more than restaurant prevailing rates... Pathetic is the word",1
"Its getting slower, saving-costs by clubbing multiple orders and yet costlier. I see no reason why anyone would pay 50 odd delivery charges and wait for others order to be delivered. Using zomato for backup ONLY now.",1
As I have got a coupon through phonepe which has been provided by the Zomato and when I am using the coupon its been showing that coupon cannot be used anymore to register complaint there is no content number no mail it's only feedback which is not even responsible I need this issue to be solved...,1
"Food was not in standard packaging, food was not hot felt like sent from a cold storage.... really not felt that standard of VEERJI MALAYI CHAAP really disappointed from VEERJI and Zomato as well..... In the view of few profits ZOMATO is lacking so many points! When it comes to food people don't like offers, discount any other stuff... instead they need fresh , hot and hugenic food remember one thing! ....",2
The app is worst. The app show us different price which is actually on the restaurant. It shows a item of 105 actually on restaurant for 237 + additional taxes upto 35 which the restaurant takes only 9. Such fakeness should be stopped. It wastes a person's money,1
Ample options and ample discounts but none work! Food takes forever to reach and discounts only show up pre billing. So one ends up paying more to get cold food. Not worth it.,1
"Great App 👍 Ordered food many times from Zomato and it delivers food on time with live status checking of food and delivery. Yhe quality of The food is also Great 😋😋. Sometimes when my mom is not in a mood of cooking ,I always order food from here. So Grateful with this app. Thanks Zomato. Regards, Debejjyo Roy Chowdhury",5
It used to give good offers at the start but right now they are just looting us for each dish they are taking 20 or 10 rupees more and also delivery price 40 rupees per delivery .which makes you pay more 60 rupees. Now the app is not at all worth to order.,2
"I'm using Zomato since years, but it's becoming worst these days. We order something n we get something. Also it's very hard to complain in the chat support n they end up giving some coupon codes which s useless",1
The Zomota in Delhi and NCR has come up with good quality food options after the lockdown. But have increased delivery fee which is more on the pockets for the customers ordering regularly. Requesting them to review the delivery fee process for regular or almost daily customers. Overall I will give Zomato a five star ⭐ for the food outlets added after the lockdown. Thanks.,4
Customer service is very very bad...there is no customer care number and you will never get proper reply on their msg service.i ordered from Zomato the amount has been deducted from my card but order didn't got confirmed. When I tried to report this through theri msg service they couldn't help me out with this issue and stopped replying. Worst experience,1
Horrible service ..... they list anyone and everyone without any credentials and then when reported they have no answers other than robots speaking....they are stealing money ....wrong order delivery and reported to an agent called gaurika ...she asked me sent picture Nd I told her that out of 5 pastries 2 are duplicate and I can send those as my friends have started consuming the rest and she cam verify whether there was order for 2 pieces of the same or not???? To which she said she can't do,1
"The meal was good that I have been order yesterday on date 27 March 21 at vrudheshwar pure veg, Shivajinagar pune, the delivery boy gave me another order, I had to travel 10 km to collect my order, I was new to Pune, I didn't know the road, I had to search the hotel at 12 o'clock at night, very disappointed.. contact me soon for more information",1
"Great service and good app. A few bugs like restaurants with no online menu are being shown in online restaurant list, which is annoying. But rest is good.",4
Such a worst app because the delivery time given 28 min when it reaches 5 min it stopes counting time in my mobile clock it's 10 min over and till in app it shows arriving in 5min and afterwards delivering it shows delivered under 5 min such a scam and worst app,1
Excellent food ordering. Maybe it takes a little time...but quality of food is just awesome. The behaviour of delivery workers are quite polite. Nice app,5
Unable to change order within 5 sec False food pictures are there,1
Amazing app . I got my delivery at my door step wit zero contact delivery . what else one can ask for! 😄 Amazing service. The delivery boys hired here are very respectful towards customer n always follow all instructions given properly. Love you zomato. Thanks for making our lives better.,5
I ordered 2 days. Both the food was worse and when I complaint to the restorent owner about missing food he started shouting and was telling don't order food again from us. Even zomato has no calling suppo. I'll never come back to zomato. I have put that food. You can taste that if I am wrong.,1
ZOMATO customer service is very bad...they are fraud people's...don't use Zomato prefer some other apps.....if you complaint to Zomato about any order..in reply they will tell you that they will give you update and later won't message you ...no update nothing...they are fraud ....avoid using Zomato,1
"Great offers ,better than swiggy in terms of price and delivery charges",5
"Good service,but location problem,please upgrade zomato service, YouTube (Akon guys )",3
"Please add the following feature: Schedule an order: I want to order from a restaurant that starts delivery at 5:30 pm. Suppose, it's 4 pm right now. I want to schedule an advanced order such that when the restaurant opens at 5:30 pm, my order gets sent to the restaurant and I get the delivery somewhere around 6pm.",4
These guys are not fulfilling the orders on time. Taking almost double the time than the time they show while booking. I had to keep on wait as neither I can cancel or order from others as I would have waited already long time.,2
"Terrible customer service first they deliver something different then what i had ordered charged for much more and while asking for a reason or solution their agests just keep transferring you to different agent not caring what are you actually saying or caring for your time and issue, swiggy is much better im gonna unistall this app soon after i make them pay for what they did. Don't download this app if you want a quality service and people who actually care about their customers that is swig",1
"Every Zomato service is Really satisfyable but The Zomato management character is the worst I have ever seen... After complaining by a Women without even Look into those problem and without knowing the actual thing happened there,u removed one delivery guy who gave almost 2000 deliveries or something else number with 4.7 rating.is this the value u have given it to the guy who give best service to Zomato users??Offcourse the user complained problem is without knowing actual thing u removed him",1
Cheap tactics!!! Making late by giving multiple orders!! I used to order in zomato due to fast delivery but now it started multiple orders !!! Local food delivery apps are better nowadays!!!,1
Pathetic customer service. I had opted 'On time or free' option but did not get the delivery within time. When I ask about it they say I haven't selected the option at all. I had selected a Promo code and later they say no coupon code was selected!,1
Zomato doesn't show delivery time at the time of order placing now after order placed order delivery time showing more than 35min. I cancelled order immediately it still deduct my 75 rs. Zomato doesn't have any customer value #uninstallzomato and be happy. fraud app by fraud company now I can relate the frustrating happen at Zomato with recent case.,1
Very bad service and support I got. They don't have a call center for supporting the problems. And If your order damaged they will not replace your order. Just saying sorry.,1
Quick transportation by Zomato. The food was less than satisfactory but that's not Zomato's fault,4
"Worst Customer sevice. Sometimes you want to order a food from your favourite restaurant which is 5 to 6 km and app doesnt allow it. And last time I accidently ordered a food from restaurant chain outlet which is 15+km, instead of outlet 3 to 4 km from to my house, and app processed my order. I immediately contacted customer support and they declined by request. Instead of usual wait time for 20mins, I had to wait for 90 mins. Pathetic. Swiching over to Swiggy.",1
I have ordered food and as I wanted to change the payment method I have press the back button they have cancel my order giving the status that payment has been failed.truly disappointed,1
Good experience so far. Zomato has never let me down ever with the variety of options available. The most amazing fact is that their speed of delivery is always at par. Kudos!!,5
Good food delivery service. Just concerned about high delivery charges on weekends and so the order gets costly. Can anything be done? Please look into this.,4
"Pathetic customer service. Only manipation, no resolution , taking hours to reply.",1
Zomato is an fantabulous app.. Honestly it has no issues about food... They deliver our favorite food in minutes..,4
"Ordering experience was good but not the payment experience.. I had Paytm food wallet credits but the app asked for payment from Paytm general wallet and I had to add money from my bank account.. and then once I transacted, I found that the app has used my food wallet and the transfer from my bank account got parked in the general wallet separately.. I think it is a bug in the app",4
"Have been using Zomato for the past few months. The choice of restaurants in our area is good. The delivery people are also good, courteous. The app is easy to use.",5
This app was good before but now it's getting unnecessarily costly. For the same restaurant there is a wide gap between the prices if compared to swiggy which is really bad.,1
If there is anything less then 1 star i would have given to zomato. Never experienced anything much worse then this. I placed twice orders and both got rejecetd and zomato is blaming resturent and resturent vise versa... never will use this app again and will tell my friends as well,1
"Great App, love it! Whenever wanna order anything just open Zomato and press order, there are good discounts and promo codes now too! It has changed from how it was before and has improved a lot!! Overall my favourite delivery app!",4
"The experience with zomato is getting worse everytime. I don't know why they hire the dumbest delivery guy on the planet. The last time I ordered pizza, the delivery guy brought it in a backpack. Can you imagine the condition of the pizza? Everything on the pizza was spilled to one side and there was nothing left on it. Who in the world brings pizza in a backpack? I wish I could share the picture. Zomato if you are reading this, i am uninstalling the app. Not going to order anything again!",4
Very Bad Show. I ordered in food today. The motorcycle of the delivery boy got off road. No action by Zomato to deliver the ordered food. No one responded on online chat or contact number. Very Bad Show,4
Excellent service even to remote areas... Love this app,5
Very irresponsible service. Third time in a week i am experiencing the issue that my order is ready at the restaurant and no rider has been assigned from Zomato. Order is getting delivered 30 - 45 minutes over given time. The service has reduced drastically!,2
"Zomato's User interface is so good compared to other online food delivery services and since 'Uber Eats' has merged into 'Zomato', this makes the later more demanding and authentic for ordering food online. Zomatos discount offers are also attractive in comparison to others. Thank you Zom'...",4
Worest service never seen kind service if your pro membership customer also they will not provide service. One they took more than 1 hour and it's near 2.5 km from my home. They even not try to give solutions.they took my money they didn't provide order. I slept with empty stomach. Bad service zomato.,1
Very user friendly app...sorting results smoothly,5
"Swiggy is much better then this Zomato... this is too costly and overrated and when I placed order it shows timing of 30 minutes and later its showing 59 minutes. I purchased Zomato pro .. but they are playing very smart it ask you too add items worth rs. 200 and more for any coupon to apply nd you can't order anything in between or under 100 rs ... so my experience is very bad with this app nd I suggest everyone to go for swiggy instead of Zomato , swiggy have more options nd coupons .",1
"Although there is no problem in zomato, but often their valets are not available, due to which they cancel the order on their own.",1
Improves alot... Nice selection of restaurants and offers are good.,3
"Awesome delivered and safety, money refunds also doing best way",5
I will definately recomend this app due to my recent incident i got one product completely destroyed from Cafe Urban ( May be due to the mistake of rider) and was not having proof to share the image alsobut very happy with Zomato those guys have refunded my money. Very happy with their services. When i had bad experience that time i have given a bad review and have uninstalled the app but i guess re-installing will not let me regret. Really happy with their customer support and approach.K😊👍.,5
"We have to add the item by segment wise into multiple orders, for example if the order consists of juice, and eat able then we were giving order into two orders instead of that if you guys can provide the access to add all the items in one order it will be very help full for the customer",4
"They ended the Zomato Pro program and yet no refund was issued UPDATE: THEY STILL DIDN'T HAD THE REFUND PROCESSED AND THE SUPPORT IS USELESS. THIS APP SHOULD BE TAKEN DOWN. DO NOT EVER TRUST THIS APP, THEY DESERVE TO BE TAKEN DOWN",1
"What seems to have started out as an independent and unbiased restaurant app for both consumers and restaurant, has silently seen where there bread is buttered and has abandoned the consumer. I regularly write a review, as of late when the review is positive it is posted, however, a negative review is pulled within hours. Zomato clearly only protect the interests of restaurants and as such I will never trust the reviews, as they are filtering what suits them (Zomato).",1
"Once i ordered from kfc via zomato , I didnt got an item , so i tried to contact zomato but didnt get any response from them . After few days I ordered from zomato but same mishap again . This time i didnt get the dish i choose instead another item was delivered to me . I request zomato to look into the matter to avoid any such inconvenience in the future . Else wise the app is easy to use and delivery is fast .",3
"I waited almost 2 hours for my order and suddenly without my concent Zomato cancelled my order. The worst part was my address was of panchkula and assigned delivery boy was roaming in chandigarh. When I was trying to explain location he started using abusive language and he was not ready to listen anything I mentioned few nearby spots,he said that he reached there and when I reached that spot he was not there. I contacted Zomato agent and only thing I hear is sorry for the inconveniences caused.",1
Order was not delivered but showing as ordered delivered. When tried to call Valet Harish he is not picking the call. I don't know what happened with my food and to whom it was delivered. If there is any mistake in delivery then delivery guy has to pick my call. If not means he did intentionally some fraud.,1
Faltu offers.. taxes very high when restaurants dont even charge on the bill and delivery charges so high even for restaurants that are not even 1km away,1
Now a days prices increased too much and added few hotels where the tsste is worst than small roadside hotels. And on top of that the prices are too much and + extra charges. After paying all this you will get worst food which will directly go into dumpyard. very disappointed with zomato nowadays,1
"Customer service persons are moron or inactive, they are not there to resolve the issue... But to cteate differance between customer & zomato app. Thankyou for the extraordinary service, not going to order from your app again. 🖕BYE BYE CHOMATO",1
"They do not give proper customer support in case of order not delivered, items missing etc. Everytime you have to chat with robot which do not offer solution to your issue. And even after writing an email thrice to customer care they don't even try to contact you.",1
Very good service and variety of foods under one umbrella.,5
Super app on intuitiveness and use. Howevee recently there are hardly any discounts.. high rates of delivery night charge etc. . Which is ok but to add misery the delivery guy will usually attend atleast two other people which adds 25 to 30 mins to delivery from a restuarant that is 3 km away from my house..,3
The experience with customer service wass so much useless ...they didn't reolved the issue and solved the problem..instead stopped replying...worst experience...swiggy is better than you,1
"Previously, I rated this app 1 star due to bad refund policy but as of now, the problem seems completely resolved, and I'm loving this app more day by day. As per my personal experience, the only visible issue left for now is lack in the option for customer support on call, otherwise everything is just perfect.",5
"Zomato is doing good service. but u can't believe in every restaurants. Some of the restaurants are Good, some are okay, some are waste. Your experience in orders will guide u, which restaurants are worth ordering. keep an eye on ratings. They are 80% true",4
Charge extra money like delivery charges and costly menu of every restaurants...,2
ordered on 13Aug at that time it showed 30mins for delivery. when i didnt receive my order even after an hour i tried calling the wallet his mobile was switched off.when i contacted the support staff they were so irresponsible the answer that i am getting was sorry for the delay we are trying to get in touch with the wallet. Same thing happened to me on 21/03/2021...ordered but got the delivery after 1 and half hour and the support staff are so arrogant.,1
I have order placed Zomato but order not delivered in my house but showing Zomato application is delivery. Already I have payment 122 ruppes Very good service Zomato. Thank you,1
Worst service. Never keep up to their commitment. Every time they delay the delivery and they will add some promo codes as compensation which makes no sense. How will stomach understand that. I am not happy with their service any more and I am uninstalling it soon,1
Convinent app to order at anytime of the day or night the application is user friendly cheers,5
Every time order has been late... And Mostly some item was missing...,1
Very bad experience. The payment was made but they said that it's not received and my money was deducted. They never returned the money even after my Bank said that the payment was received by them. It's been 50 days and I am still mailing them,1
"After placing order, there is no means of direct contact number. Some silly person comes on chat line who asks us rather than reply. Now if they deduct the money from the wallet then we should forget about it.",1
"Poor service, i given order and they didn't assigned any valet, after given order approx 1 hr .. very bad service. I suggest do not order from zomato, threre lot of options & offer from another.",1
I am using Zomato for about 3 yrs now. And every promo code says its only for new users. Old users have no promos to use. And prices have also increased by lot. And if we are ordering regularly prices keep on increasing.,1
"Delicious 😋 food of ur choice at ur door step has made easy for common man at all situations,,,, Thanku",5
"Very good app , lat of food options, fast service ..",4
It has been very costly now a days in bangalore they are doubling the prices compared hotel menu card after offer we get 5/10 Rs reduction not more than that. Deleting the app,1
App works seamlessly & Order placing is super quick but needs to work on their delivery time....Even in the morning & afternoon also food doesn't gets delivered by the assured time!!!,3
Worst service and customer support. they reply after hours. Even if you are pro they took hours to reply. Customer care need improvement .Even if they refund u are always in loss as we have to pay delivery charge again even it is not our fault for quality and quantity related promblems.,1
Poor service from Zomato. Unable to ensure that the food ordered is delivered to the customer. My last two consecutive orders have been cancelled by Zomato. The worst is the customer service by their executives.,1
Delivery charge and other charges are higher than food charges. I had always hated Zomato for this. There is a problem going on in our local area so swiggy delivery is not happening that's y opting this.,1
Worst service ever.. I made an order of Rs. 475 a month ago and due to some technical glitch the payment got failed. My money got deducted from bank and transferred to Zomato's ICICI. I've reported this issue to their team but there has been no refund till now. All they say is its been initiated and will reach your account in 4 to 5 days. Its been a month already... Why you guys don't offer any one to one customer support? Pathetic!,1
"Worst food delivery app ever,this is the second my time same restaurant missed my oreder first was custard and today rabdi, and when I report to Zomato they give me 50 rs promo code which is not at all useful because again when I'll order they will charge me 60 rs delivery charge + taxes, what's the use? Basically I'll be paying for more than 2 items for getting 1, and then they will ask to send your problems on email to which they never reply, just pathetic looting customers nothing else.",1
Zomato delivery is always on time. Or before time it's reached.,5
Order delivered late but no cashback instead of on time or free service,1
"Menu options has only veg and egg, why am I not getting the options for non-veg menu , does your AI only capture previous orders and show only veg menu... This is ridiculous showing only veg options while am non- veg and veg , I want to have all the available options",1
"Best food delivery app. Nice UI/UX, responsive customer support and definitely have the first mover advantage in this area. Need to tackle price variation, what the restaurant charges on their app and what it charges offline.",5
Worst experience..if you will not receive call two three times..they will cancel.your order and no refund will be given according to company policy....never order from this app..especially prepaid order...no call support system....,1
"It's always feels awesome to get such a lovely service from Zomato. The delivery partners was so polite and gentle. Even in this scorching sun and riding through this bad conditioned road, he managed to deliver the order perfectly within the time. Just one word ""GREAT"".",5
Fu.....ing app to user friendly It doesn't have the cancel option after the order missing placed order,1
"Just a bad overall experience. The app load time is too long, and it takes a long time to even search anything.",1
Today after using Zomato for almost 2years I am quitting this app as I have faced multiple disappointment from Zomato. I have placed the order on Zomato and after waiting for my order for more that 90 mins when I call them they are saying due to technical issue we can't proceed you order. And I have faced this issue 2 times since last 10 days. When I first started using the Zomato it had a amazing service but as the app gain popularity and more consumer it's became negligent towards its custom,1
Service getting worse for sure. Waited for a delivery for 1 hour over promised time and thats after the help of their customer service already. Food obviously arrived cold since the problem is they didnt have enough riders to accommodate orders.,1
"WORST SITE FOR ORDERING FOOD They do not have coordination among them.. I had and experience once i had ordered food and prepaid it but when the delievery man came he refuse to deliever the order and then asked for the money , this way they taken double amount for single order.. After complaining so much i havent received my money back... WORST EXPERIENCE WORST SITE",1
Your comment section and adding photos section is not getting updated. Guess it's a bug,2
Love the Zomato App..Easy to Use & On Point. Zomato offers great discounts on food and provides Super Fast Delivery Experience! Also love how they keep updating every little aspect of the orders & valet getting our food! Keep up the good work! Great Customer Experience ☺️😃,5
Very bad experience very very very wrost app I faced problem 2nd time in a week. And now I do not place order ever from this app.,5
"Sometimes, it first shows you a discounted price (even without promo code) on an item and as soon as you click on Pay Now, it charges you the original price which was earlier shown with a strikethrough. Pretty annoying...",3
"Worst aap ever now, you can't access chat support ...how could they get down like swiggy",1
They are so insensitive when comes to customers issues ..I ordered so much from past few days and I regret as the food was very bad... But they have removed the option of connect to an agent where I can't even put forth my issues.. I'm uninstalling this app.. Highly disappointed to the core with their bad service.. And switching to swiggy.. Swiggy is so much better,1
Good food quality and fast delivery and very honest in payment and wear mask also with social distancing,5
"It's an app to delivery food, we can't give bad comment to the app, the delivery has done by 40 mins",5
Disgusting experience. Gives stale order. Never on time. And no response on any query. What is the need of customer support when they are not responding. Terrible experience... 0 rating,1
Very bad experience of getting food delay and getting cold food which wasn't edible bcz Zomato assigned another order to delivery guy so my food was prepared but that guy waited for an hour than came to me for delivery. Was constantly chatting on support portal but they were pathetic to support customer. Really bad experience. Better to go self and collect food rather spending unnecessary to this careless service provider.,1
The delivery service is great and reliable!,5
Received wrong order and now they are not refunding nor replacing. Just transfering the chat to new team. No proper response received,1
"Food quality mostly very poor. Like I ordered Biryani and Chicken-chap combo..today. Stale chicken, very oily and tasteless preparation. I had to throw away the full chicken chap, not suitable for consumption. Delivery has been good.",2
"No details of the delivery agent, takes 2 hours to get your food delivered, plus during the time for cancelation. They will charge you the cancellation charges too!",1
Dont use this app or any such food agregator app too often but i'm amused by the ease of convience this app gives. Codes at its best for the best. Thank you Team Zomato😇,5
It used to be good. But now they charge around 100rs just for delivery and taxes.,1
Too much difference between restaurant prices and Zomato prices! Funny thing I was ording food worth 40rs from 1km thought 10/20 rs will be delivery charges! Guess what! Food worth 40Rs & delivery charges 60+1(covid bla bla)😂 these guys are on another level 😂time to try other Apps!,1
Delivery was faster Food taste and quality excellent Served almost 3 adults,5
"The only big issue I have is with the customer service. When there's a problem with the order, it is impossibly difficult to get the ""chat support"" to help you with your order.",3
Some restro that are available for online delivery are shown to not available for particular areas which doesnt come in restricted area when i contact them to confirm they reply they are delivering in our areas poor app service,1
The prices that my friend and I see in app has lot of difference . For me a dal khichdi is 149 where as my friend sees for 109. 40 rs diff for single item. In my whole life I paid 50% higher than my friend when I compared. This is called a loot. Both of us are pro members on top . Waah what a loot,1
"I think Zomato is tied with all unauthorised restaurants, recently I didn't receive the bill for my order..the rating of the restuarant was above 4..but the quality of packing is very bad and quantity is also very less for the price..not at all worthy.",1
"My payment was failed last Sunday, but iwas not received my money as they said it will credited back in 3-5 days",1
poor customer support 2 years and even worse now...if by chance you have to get refund..that's the end of story!! Very very ineffective customer support!! I am changing the review to 3** for the food and comfort and effort given by Zomato...however i would still suggest Zomato seriously look at customer support!! I would have exchanged at least 10 mails but surprisingly none of executives even read the grievance properly!! Finally one Tapesh understood and resolved in minutes! Mailed to this id!,3
"This app made food delivery very east, Very easy to use.",5
Horrible. Customer care no. never responds. Trying to get a copy of my bill. It tool entire day but still could not get. No number reponds available on google also. Worst worst worst.,1
The map was incorrect. There needs to be an option for us to modify delivery location. However the delivery was fine as I was able to call and guide the delivery man,4
Out of first 4 orders 2 were damn late and today i have recieved my order after 1 hr 30 mins late by almost 45 min (no rush no traffic due to night curfew at 10) .during the followup executive's only saying we regret ur inconvenience and we are sorry and keep sending bot templates ....i dont want anything free but when i already paid full amount and got cold food after hours of follow up this makes me angry really angry ...that was my last order with zomato thanks n bye.DO NOT USE ZOMATO,1
Very bad customer service. Did not get my delivery and order status was updated to delivered. You really need to have a customer call centre as your chat support isnt as effective.,1
I had a complaint regarding my order and in the middle of the chat the support executive not respondee to my problems and left in btw.. end chat option also not come bcz of which I couldn't restart my chat..very disappointed with your chat support,1
Charging delivery fees and other taxes are very high. This charges should be low otherwise it is not feasible to order if these charges are very high. Then local area food stores are better option.,1
"Worst experience, time keeps on changing according to their own comfort . everytime need to reach out to support for help. No on time delivery, day by day becoming worst .worst experience . I am bearing from long time , but now uninstalling this worst app.",1
"Pathetic service Zomato makes no effort to hold their delivery partners accountable for late deliveries. Even after multiple issues, they are absolutely unbothered about fixing it. Always sticking a food promo code and closing the issue.",1
no support they are only interested in orders no support after delivery no response and finally we belive your problem is resolved. I have deleted the application though I hold gold membership,1
"This app is great, you can order food even in lockdown.........",5
Delivery charges and taxes seems on a higher side now.,4
"Zomato charged me twice for my order. The customer service was rude in responding to my query. They even cut the conversation in the middle and went offline. I was charged for the transaction as my bank account is overseas. They never credit back the transaction fees. The customer service always try to cover them up, Put the blame on others, no empathy. The most annoying part is they keep responding with their scrips and cut the conversation in the middle.",1
The food taxes are high and restaurants are also charging a transport charges..,2
Its not showing promocodes while I am trying to use it. It is showing as promocodes are not applicable for this order for all restaurants. I have mailed a number of times about it but no responce from their side. That is why I deleted my Zomato account. Just dont waste money for this app.,1
Very good app experience. Food delivery has been very professional and timely. Packaging n accuracy of delivery time is spot on. I would highly recommend zomato,5
"Nice, delivering faster than others, overall very good service",4
"They won't even reply on time not to mention buggy app, think they don't care about customer service anymore. Would've given zero stars if possible. They won't even reply anymore",1
Very bad customer service I have placed order Rs174 and Zomato apply Delivery charge Rs 53 then also apply delivery surge Rs 40 on After noon time At 2 Pm and say that its5 peak time you are mad peak time Start on evening when everyone order food for diner. And. Customer service was very bad I have ordered many food at Zomato but I face issuewith 2 order .I have very disappointed with Zomato.,1
"During this pandemic time and my crisis situation, zomato deliveries have contributed in delivering food on time and risking of getting on door to door so people can have food. 5 stars for their service.",5
Worst experience with customer care agent name komal..she is not taking any responsibility of non availability of item and putting back on customer.Haldiram does this many time and still doesnt close the window of non availability and after 30 minutes they call and say they dont have so i have to wait for another 30 mts.very unprofessional and unhelpful.doesnt deserve to be in that place.A BIG ZERO..,1
i had ordered chicken dum biriyani... The taste was amazing.. delivery on time... Mouth watering food.. packaging was nice.. must recommended,5
Great tp see most delivery guys understand and speak marathi (local language). Well Done Team Zomato 👍,5
"Most of the times get messages like this restaurant doesnot deliver to your location, currently not accepting order, then what is the use of this app to order online. If restaurant doesn't deliver why it's showing in the app, show only restaurants which deliver.",2
Very good app with many offers and prices were comparatively low,5
Only veg items no non veg in all menu what may the reason I can't understand..,1
Late orders are not being discounted at all !!! Customer callback requests turned down too !!,1
"Unable to login with Facebook for the last 2 months. My account is linked with that. Contacted support, they replied with no proper justification.",1
Quick and easy interface and Good offers...,5
No use of Membership... Charging applied post that also.. Spoke to Agent Tuhina.. such a wonderful support cancelled border and with same breath within 5 min I have decided to cancel my Zomato membership also...lost one loyal old customer.... No use of so many promotion if don't have qualified agents how to speak to customers....,1
I ordered some food but it had a dispute... And inspite of it they did give payment to my wallet and add a coupon to my Zomato app.. But at that time I don't want to order food from Zomato but I experienced a very bad impact on my life.. and at that time I bound to order food from Zomato. Is it great behave???,1
Can allow better understanding on what items can be customised to Vaishnav and Jain dietary requirements,4
Experiencing good option from variety of outlets.,3
Waste App for online food delivery...I ordered 5 days before from restaurant but the delivery didn't gaved my order and in app for me it showed already delivered...after that I sawed the delivery boy number is also not there to call him where he was...again I went I zomato app and I'm trying to talk with Zomato agent..but no one was responding...in that it was showing now it's to busy...and in this app they will not provide any Customer number also...that's why don't order anything from this,1
Expected timings can be made more precise. Sometimes the map doesn't work properly. 4 star because of these two drawbacks..otherwise very much satisfied.,4
"They are sending whatever food they like. For garvy they send soup, for chicken noodle there is no chicken. If we complain about this they state they are not responsible for ingredients. If there is no chicken in chicken noodles, I doubt what are the ingredients.",1
"Currently there are huge delays on delivering the orders..the restaurants that are 15mins away from our place also takes almost 2 hrs to deliver the food...have been experiencing this since January end. Apart from this problem, everything is good.",4
"Very very good app , we can know more about the hotels , cost of food , with this app This app is also usefull in emergency situations... During this covid time the riders are strictly following the covid precautions like wearing masks , sanitizing hands , checking temperature , etc...😊☺️😊👍👍👍",5
Can't apply coupon / promo code as the payment is deducted everytime without even promoting or showing order summary. Very bad app.. Poor customer service.. Tried chatting with the customer support but they didn't help at all.. I faced the issue thrice.,1
"I like it service, fast delivery and good service",5
I love the time delivery option and it's always on time...,4
"Awesome app, and complaints handled very efficiently",5
It's good but not as fast as swiggy... and also it doesn't even care to pack food properly in this covid era ...its pathetic After using it more than a week I can say this company deserves 5 star but in minus . . Worth -5 star,1
looks like you guys made a deal with the restaurants to send the leftover food from the customers table who visit the restaurant. that's how you and the restaurants are making money. May be you not be able to check the quality of the food but the delivery guys have an option to check if the food is hot or not. the delivery on time but the food is delivered cold. it's food so you must delivery it hot particularly the biryanis.you can't eat biryani if it's cold. May be you can but seriously I cant,1
"Zomato app is easy to use, has my favorite restaurant listed & discount offerings are good too. However the delivery charges pinch a lot.",5
"Wow the app was so slow, it gave me enough time to actually think about my life. I have decided to give my children more time instead of running behind money. Thank you ZOMATO for giving us this slow app, it changed my life.",2
"I wonder how this app has 4 star rating,it isn't worth 1 star. Have Wrost experience till I used, even before covid pendamic.Their price, delivery men, customer service etc. all below 1 star rating.",1
Your Food Price=159 Delivery Charge=36 Taxes & Charges=47 Total cost= 159+36+47=242 Apply coupon 50% OFF 242/2=121 & This is the final price of your food. You can get this food at your nearest place in 70-80 ruppes {under 100₹},1
"No benefit s of a pro member they will give you on your first order but after that they put some conditions to add some more to your order which is very annoying .I think they don't care about so called "" we serve the best for customer"".",3
Need to do with delivery partners and also some hotels take too much time to prepare... Changing my review because it's second time with me.. Disappointed,2
"Very bad service ,do not use this app.THEY ARE SCAMMERS. They literally keep your order anywhere if phone is not reachable . I order food from zomato and my phone was unreachable(according to them , but we have good connectivity in our area). So they kept order on road at wrong address , took a pic and marked my order as delivered. The location of my house was correct on zomato but still order was not on location . Wth is this , it does not make any kind of sence.",1
"I have been using it for many years like most of us. Always found it convenient, quick and hassle free. Simply awesome. Keep it up!",5
Very nice app delivery is very fast and Delivery boy very good person,4
"Worst experience ever.. Even after pro membership, they don't give immediate delivery. Even after pickup in 10 to 15 mins max they made me wait for 45 mins to 1 hour.. They took another restaurant order n that restaurant guy say ur order is in long queue.. What's the use of taking pro membership.. They don't give free delivery like swiggy neither they give delivery immediately after pickup... Guys go for swiggy.. Don't go for ZOMATO ever. Delivery wS like from sanpada to Sanpada but still rubbis",1
They absolutely shafted me with their pro membership scam. They advertised the membership saying you will have more discounts and will have discounts on delivery but once you actually buy into the membership they say the order has to be above a price which you cannot afford. That's the first scam and the second scam is they literally have 2 good 4 star plus restaurants and the app says these rest cant provide servc to my location when the hotel is 4 kms away from my place. Disgusting.,1
So helpful at the time of remote places to order food for loved ones,5
customer helpline services will take more than 1 hr to resolve your issue and they will ask for photo after watching that still they will ask you to wait,1
After 3 orders my cash on delivery option is unavailable. Horrible app.,1
"In my second order I got preserved food and I threw it totally in dustbin and I claim for compensation but those chat support guys playing with us to refund the amount,i requested too many times but they didn't respond to me it's horrible services by zombies please use Swyggi app it's too good for any thing",1
Have had a very good and pleasant servicibility with zomato.. Hassle free door delivery.. I appreciate the fact that some riders do minimal calls n reach home right on time.. Hats off to the system and the app experience is really very smooth.. Rider mapping is super awesome.. Kudos to the team.,5
Help/Support doesn't have option to give error in Billing issues. My order was for Rs.203/-. Discount offer was 50% or ₹100 whichever is less. But discount given was ₹83.67 in place of ₹100/-.,1
"Worse experience.paid my order by Google pay.before delivery, I got delivered very late.since I've paid before.if I would have done cash on delivery,I would have received order very quickly...",1
I ordered for a simple idly which was delivered from a hotel 12 km away from my location and my idly cost was 85 and my delivery charge was 65. It was delivered in 45 minutes from the time of order doesn't makes sense for me y the siple idly was ordered from 12 km Why can't it be made quick n fast n resanoble fro customers ur making it complicated,2
Really inefficient delivery when opting the online payment service. They take their time...,2
"This is the most horrible experience. I ordered a red velvet cheese cake and it was damaged when it got delivered. And when I tried to contact the customer service, or the support center they were not even responding promptly and after a point they have stopped responding. Very bad experience",1
These guys are so irresponsible that they have sent me non veg food when i have ordered veg and when i am trying to complain about this they are not taking it seriously from last half an hour they are saying your chat will be transferred as soon as possible and i have screen shot of all the chat I can show the proof of irresponsible behavior of zomato at such big concern,1
Average app but it should give some more promo codes and should decrease the delivery charges...they do not give proper attention or solutions to problems if restuarents do deliver items properly or if items are missing in your order... Disappointed on this ..,3
"ZOMATO always a ahead....!!! Fastest delivery, very good discount 👌 zomato is better than swiggy",5
I am using this review as a platform to raise concerns over the recent incident.Requesting you to kindly take care of all delivery partners as they work hard diligently keeping a smile ondedicating their time and effort to bring a smile across customers....recent incident which included a ruffle occuring between the two parties should not become the sole operating reason to dismiss or terminate any delivery partner.I urge you to kindly look into the matter and last but not the least app is great,5
mouth watering crispy chicken in a very reasonable price.higly recommend.!!!,5
Worst app and worst service they don't reply you back if you have any complaint against the products neither they resolve and no method to contact with customer support executive. Swiggy service is much better they reply within 2 hours I suggest to download swiggy. Ticket id 7442398 most worst app don't download it I am warning you,1
"Unreasonable high delivery, surge and tax charges, making food ordering from this app useless. Also, the discrepancy between the pricing offline and online makes this platform untrustworthy.",1
The service was good earlier .. now they don't really take feedback from customers . And service is worst .. foods are always spilling ..refund amount takes days to come back .,2
Zomato support sucks. It is the most horrible experience I've ever had. They will just not respond if there is an issue and they need to refund and expect you to give up and stop bothering them. I reccomend swiggy over it by 10000 times.,1
"Good discount and services. But some of the restaurant not accepting order due to Zomato app problem (New sagar fast), need to be resolved from Zomato end",4
Worst experience. These people are cheating with customer by just cancelling the order and not refunding the amount by saying amount cant be refunded and charge it as cancellation charge. Dont use zomato.Go for others . Swiggy is much better than this and its customer support and policy are much better. If you want to loose your money then only go for it otherwise simply uninstall and advise others to do for the same.,1
Love this place ... awesome staff with suggesting good food and and they are always ready for customised food with no complaints...and the best part is prices are unbelievable ...u can't even compare with local bar and restaurant it's so affordable,5
The app glitches as my number was exposed to other customers and they were calling me for their order Also when I ordered subway that was delivered open...at covid times and customer care team we cannot do anything as per policy its not damaged and no compensation ...wow at this pandemic time zomato is delivering food open on torn cover ....and food all coming out of the package,1
Bug while paying Tip with Internet Banking. When I have already selected the payment mode as Internet Banking. still on Next it goes to the same saved payment methods and not able to go further to My bank payment website.,3
Delivery time is not updated accurately. Always changes as per wish.,1
Great Service. Resolve issues for customer satisfaction .,5
It's an okay app but I think the more instructions is not working or the delivery guys forget. They always ring the bell....🔔 when I told them not to!,2
This is one of the worst online food delivery service No customer service at all they have to refund my amount and every time they say a customer service agent will contact in 24 hours which is all lies Hope any one can help,1
Great app easy to order and great delivery👏👍👍,4
From last week there is no available restuarant on my location and this happened for the first time and it's been one week. How could this be possible that suddenly all restuarant got unavailable on my location,2
"I think after the current incident,zomato and other companies should stop giving cash on delivery option to their customers as some customers misuse this feature and also a delivery boy is a poor and common men and so food delivery time limit should be maximise so that customers cant abused the delivery boy and misuse this servive too.",5
Worst experience..Im reviewing this when my second order was cancelled.After waiting for 45 min I get a msg from customer care that my order is cancelled due to some technical issue..And this happened not once but twice..Their service has detoriated tremendously.uninstalling for sure!,1
I don't even want to give it a star.! Since this recent update it did not open even once.! I actually lost count of how many times I tried to open the app & it didn't open.!,1
"Received incorrect order on delivery but on raising the issue they say they will look into it! Swiggy has 100 times better support. Edit: issue was solved finally and I'm currently happy with the application, so updating the rating.",5
Zomato Pro is a scam. Their payment method had a technical error due to which I wasn't able to avail benifits. Even though they admitted to the technical fault they still are not ready to compensate or fix the mistake. Really disappointing experience and extremely poor customer care service. Strongly suggest not to take Zomato pro.,1
Worst service provider. Delivery partner takes multiple orders at a time which results delay in service. Worst customer support.,1
"worst , waste of money and time , even the delivery charge is much more than the order itself...really not even worth one star...👎 , Really disappointed.",1
"I use Zomato frequently. Zomato gives the option of reclaiming your money or giving it free if its late. I personally seeked a refund even 8 mins and they refunded as said. SAME TIME, it was mentioned in the disclaimer that ZOMATO DELIVERY BOYS ARE NOT PINALiSED FOR ThE DELAYS. I ONLY SAY . IF YOU WANT TO CLAIM REFUND. PLEASE SEEK IT FROM ZOMATO CUSTOMER CARE,don't fight with the delivery boys. They work hard day and night to help us get our orders when we are at home. Even in worst Pendemic",5
"you guys are not worth enough to order anything from your platform.. your agentd are not capable enough tk solve the issue, they are just transferring the chat from one person to another.service is not upto the mark",1
Very bad ... Here customer service also very bad they don't have manners how to talk with customers... If you cancel your order they don't refund... very bad my experience so according to me don't go with it.🥵🤢,1
Few feature changes in the application made specifically in the delivery part is beautiful. Although a lot needs to be changes in ui/users perspective and it was a good start.,4
I am happy with your services today...i had a bad experience fw months ago..but zomato again proved me wrong with their exceptional quality and services..that is why i deleted my reviews and started using again..Specially in this covid situation they r all working..so gr8 work guyz ..u r rocking company and i m very happy to become your valuable customer. Thanks to all d staff members ..specially delivery boys who r working for all of us..just a small request..fuyz plz give them good tips aswel,5
"Gives rapid delivery,!!tracks order accurately..thank you",5
"Pathetic service by Zomato, before placing the order it shows 30 minutes to deliver, once payment is done n order placed it shows 45 minutes to deliver , clearly waste of time n fraud. Also earlier I placed order, Zomato showd valet is at restaurant for order pickup ,n cancelled the order ,this process also esdyed my 30 minutes..if restaurant is not accepting the orders why to show in delivering list... N waste time.",2
Previously service was great. But recently service is worst. Nowadays i m facing issues in every order- either the order is delayed ( so delayed approx hours) or else have to cancel the order. Worst service. Worst....,1
Usless app forcing me to ordee above 300 then reduce the delivery charges. They do it to less known restaurants. Its pure evil and ugly.,2
"On time delivery, Professional approach by the executive overall very nice experience..,.",5
"Worst app to order, Use other apps like swiggy which are much better and have a class apart customer service. The Zomato agents don't follow instructions and they expect the user to pay for incorrect orders that zomato served in lockdown. The customer service agents are extremely unhelpful.",1
The application is out standing and satisfy the customer needs. The service are appreciating. Even if any complain is it solved immediately. Love it,5
Promo code not showing at the time of payment.... Firstly it is written that 50%off on orders... At the time of payment full amount has to pay with out any discount... Dishes price is too high at this platform...,1
"This app chooses the delivery address by itself based on location and won't allow you to cancel the order if it is to be delivered to our address of choice, Zomato should learn from other similar Apps.",1
Very bad experience in delivery taking more than 1:30hrs to deliver one order where in app it was showing 30mins. Pathetic service. It's better to go ahead with Swiggy. Much professional service. Don't order from Zomato.,1
"Shame on you guys. Check your price tags of all restaurants, you are charging more than double of the menu rates of the restaurants in whole tricity. You think, people will not get to know about this. I will not recommend this crooked app and website.",1
"It's very good,but the reason why I am giving four starts is some delivery hero's are making extra's.largly 90% delivery candidates are good,10% are worst.please check candidates patience and attitude before considering those 10% worst candidates. All over review excellent, thank to boys who are delivering in polite ,all the best for everyone. 👍👍👍👍🤴🏻🤴🏻🤴🏻",4
Very Bad as no customer service support as I wanted to cancel oder but unable It will be waste of money and Pizza. Its pathetic service...even in a second I was unable to cancel order and app is no option to ask confirm order. Plz refund my amount of last order from PIZZA hut,1
Price for food items are very costly than the actual price at the restaurant. Have to wait for long time to get the food delivered.,1
I would like to say one of the best app for food is Zomato and in addition to that if there is a pro membership then there will be a bunch and raining of offers with quality food strictly advise to download it and enjoy the benefits of it and also would like to appreciate Zomato for their assistance when order is delayed or cancelled then they will come up with Vochure which can be used in upcoming order finally install the app and enjoy the benifits,5
"Best place to have customized food... cozy and friendly environment.. books, projector and board games also available for customers.. Good place to spend time with the special one......",5
The food was great ! Both quality and quantity were perfect with respect to price. The food was worth spending on!Highly recommended!!,5
"Most good for nothing food delivery app... Had ordered a few times from here, which in turn was a big mistake.. nearly half the time delivery persons are met with accidents...I don't understand why...",1
App is good but I don't see any privilege added after purchasing Zomato Pro subscription. Also I believe tht the prices added to most of restaurant's menu is 20-30% high comparetively getting the same dish by visiting the restaurant in person.,3
On time or Free? Really?? I hav opted for this option after 45 min past my order was still at the restaurant. Then the '44min or free' disappeared and it showed u'll receive in 30min!. I mean Why to put that option?,5
It used to be great app once. But the recent heavy delivery charges is ruining it everything. I'm a pro user yet if this mindset continues will be using other parallel apps.,1
"The restaurants which do not deliver my location shouldn't be shown in my recommendation or search results. It's really pathetic experience to see that ""This Restaurant do not deliver"" post you select the items :(",2
"There is no cancel option when i was about to change my mind in ordering , also very slow processing to get a delivery driver it took me 2 hours, and I had already passed my lunch time break.",1
"Its staff are really like goons. Once they come to know that you are outsider they will start misbehaving. They will not come to exact location. Instead they will call you to the place they r waiting at. Shouting at their customers is very common. Sometimes they will use abusive language also. Details of the delivery guy are often mismatching.Sometimes they will eat ur meal, sometimes they will punch you on ur face.But Zomato will show there manipulated rating to defend them.Ubereats was better.",1
I personally feel zomato is better than swiggy..because it has more offers than swiggy..But the delivery charges are litle high compared to swiggy..And food prize is cheaper..so it balances..The customer support is really very good i zomato..If there is ny isse they wont hesitate to give refund.And its not a bot most of the type it will be real guy,5
"It's a good application , solution of hunger specially when I don't want to cook, Zomato never disappoint me. I would appreciate it's improving nature according to customer.",5
The rates are higher than the actual rates of the place + extra tax and gst + delivery charges. Better to directly order from the restaurant. Almost forgot the extra time they take for delivery,1
"Mostly on time, customer service needs improvement.",4
"I have ordered 2-3 times from Zomato and every time food was full of colour and it wasraw.zomato is making fool of people who trust this app along with bunch of restaurants!! Pathitic!! I specially want to mention Udupi restaurant,they sent food which was not fit for humans to consume.It all is happening under the very eyes of Zomato.No quality control No hygienic protocol followed.What is Zomato charging for,if it can't assure that its clients get clean n healthy meal! Shame to you guys!!",1
My experience this is very good and very fast delivery 🚚 my choise is best app,5
"The customer service is the worst!!....they don't even listen to what you say, they only speak what they want to. They can't help you when you encountered a problem with their service, i wonder why they are maintaining a customer support team when don't want to support or help customers. Totally fed up with the disgusting experience the app has given to me.",1
Pathetic delivery experience as they club 2 or more orders and by the time the order reaches you after 90 MINS the food gets cold and tasteless.,2
"This place is great! Atmosphere is chill and cool but the staff is also really friendly. They know what they’re doing and what they’re talking about, and you can tell making the customers happy is their main priority. Food is pretty good, some italian classics and some twists, and for their prices it’s 100% worth it",5
"I wanted to give half star but it's not available....... all the offer codes are invalid, they simply cheat the people by saying offers just to grab attention, but no coupon codes get applied. Worst app ever..... swiggy and rapido are better........",1
"Online delivery is always delivered late , even if it is short distance ,due to combining the other orders and delivery,they do delivery even by bicycle minimum half an hour for the delivery",1
I literally had the worst customer service experience of my life. I went 16 minutes on the chat without anybody even asking me what the problem is. Genuinely terrible and I strongly advise going to one of the competitors with better support. Terrible.,1
"Worst app, that tym was my third experience every time, my order were late and taked more than 1and half hours even 15minutes the distance, last time it takes 2 hour. Such a bad experience",1
Very poor service.. orders are delayed by an hour and no response from the customer care of zomato.. delay happened 2 times in 2 days.. order not even getting cancelled after so much delay.. worst experience..,1
"Pathetic app, I had added promo code but while making payment; promo code got removed. I contacted to chat support but to my surprise, support is also pathetic.",1
It is awesome app but there is a small problem which I have face .I have given an order after 3 to 4 minutes I taught to cancel it but I cannot cancel the order because I cannot see any cancellation mode in Zomato. try to cancel. I contact with the restaurant and I contact with the delivery boy but they don't know how to cancel it even I .so make it easy way for a person. like how you are taking order the same way you should take cancellation?,4
Most pathetic customer service...after 1 hr of chat I am told issue has been resolved but i am unable understand it !,1
"Im a regular customer of zomato.. And i was always happy about it's service.. But tdy when I wanted to order the food.. Usually they add 20rs more than the actual restaurant price.. Tdy the difference is 90rs..due to issue, zomato mgt be having loss but don't steal money from the people who are still using it.. I'm very disappointed.. 90rs food after all charges is 186rs?",3
Waste app. The service is worst. For every order there is an issue but they don't care.,1
Zomato is an awesome app when it comes to food delivery.... It gives many coupons to make your payment easy... It has many restraunt options from which we can choose.... Loved it!,5
The food whichever I have ordered would be very tasty and would reach in time not more than half an hour of placing the order. Very helpful app.,5
"The delay in delivery, absence of any support to call, wrong order delivery due to multiple deliveries by same person... leaving Zomato, as there seem to be no attempt to work on better delivery, just apologies on the chat support.",1
Delivery charges keep on increasing on every step. No accurate pricing at any step. Way to go for other app.,1
Best app just click on some buttons and your favourite food will be there in some time,5
"Was good initially. But right now, there is an abnormal increase in the MRP and the service charge as well, on this app. This is a scam of sorts.",1
Very very leate delivery. Fund paid already. Cancelled the order due to late delivery. 5 -7 working days for returning payment. Very inconvenient reply from customer support.,1
"Anytime there is any problem with my order and I raise a concern, Zomato customer service just says that there is nothing that they can do. They never take any responsibility and obviously the restaurant has already disposed off the bad food it wanted to and does not care anymore and Zomato is the medium that helps them to do so and cheats their customers. Other competitors have always taken the necessary action and made sure the request was fulfilled. Definitely would not recommend this app.",1
Pathetic customer care service. Takes hours and hours to give any resolution,1
"This is pathetic app, they always have issues with delivery. The charges are too high in compare to quality of services. I always had a bad experience with zomato",1
An option to tip the riders should be added after the delivery. Today I had a poor experience with a rider.,3
Very nice Service Me and my family was also very happy with the service,5
This is the best app for foodies. This app provides all the information related with location and delivery. The workers are punctual as they deliver the food on time,5
better app for food delivery & options... must appreciate the way U maintain tie up with food chains,5
"Service issue again , I had uninstalled Zomato after a issue Before one and half year , I had ordered one item and somehow order cancelled from restaurant or Zomato I don't know but I had not received any refund and food. At present again there is service issue. Time to uninstall for lifetime.",1
Horrible customer service. They always find excuses to not give refunds despite being their fault or the restaurant's. Valets are very fast and efficient however the customer service team is not willing to help.,2
"I am really happy with Zomato's service, ease of use, prompt delivery plus able to follow the delivery process in real time, however although I have added the tips along with the payment, I have been informed that sometimes the driver's have not been reimbursed",5
"Before delivery of the items, app is showing items are door step....",2
Zomato support was not good. They asked me to wait in chat and didnt reply and no measures to solve issue. Very bad,1
Not all items show on Zomato. I called a few restaurants like Mac Donalds and KFC to order some items that the restaurant actually had but did not show on Zomato,1
Pathetic Service...Food is ready but zomoto representative has not picked the order since last 30 min... No update on the App.. It shows will be delivered in 10 min for the last 30 min.... And it shows on time..... What the hell,1
Very helpful for us anytime anywhere delivery and most important friendly staff,5
Zomato staff is too good and very polite. Food is exactly same as shown in the app menu though some restaurants sucks. Overall it's a good app with minimum bugs and with a great interface.,5
Very good zomato ap is very helpfully low rate price foodies and quqly delivery at hotel thank you very much zomato,5
"You order something, you get something and when you check viola you had ordered the thing that has been delivered, happened with me 3 times hence cannot be a mistake on my end",1
"Rating option for Zomato Valet goes missing if I rate but forgot to submit (done) it, but Food Rating area is still accessible after some time. App developer s should work on that part.",5
"Useless delivery, huge issues , delays by more than 1 Hrs, GPS locations for delivery not updating, no call response by Delivery guy Nitin, huge delay and no technical response may attributes to the adulteration in ordered food. Only God knows what we r getting? Pls choose any other app",1
This is very amazing for order something. I like very much because no waiting is there after ordering a delivery is on the time.,5
Zomato in Kolkata is performing horribly recently. It always takes more than double the time shown. Most of the time it is the app that miscalculates the estimated time and misleads the customers. If one delivery takes 2hours please tell us. DON'T FOOL US.,1
"One of the worst app in food delevery domain, uber was far better than zomato bcz in uber users always gets more offers than zomato and this app has so many bugs, I am unable to use any promo code in my zomato account and when I am trying to login and order food using my mobile number app is showing this number is temporarily ban since last 3 months and when I m trying to connect with zomato team unable to get any reply after sending feedback and reporting the bug and writing email.",1
The zomato gold unlock button is not working with the latest version on android phones.,1
Zomato takes the same amount of time it takes you to go to a shop buy the vegetables and prepare the food. I think they should start a grocery store instead. Considering renaming it to 'slow'mato,1
From my opinion its the best app. It offers you so many discounts and best rates. I mean what do we want more than that. Using it from last 2-3 years,5
Zomato is THE best food delivery app in India! All other apps cannot even come closer to Zomato's customer service quality and creativity. The best part is the dynamic natire of this food delivery service. I've been fully loyal Zomato user — and plan to be so for years to come!,5
"Been using zomato ever since ubereats. Out of all the food delivery apps i used, zomato was a better experience, still using it. Would give it 5 stars for there service n delivery time. Overall happy with the zomato experience.",5
"Zomato has always been the one point destination for the whole family. The complete foodie delicacies on your screen in a second, and on your table in a jiffy. Cheers team Zomato. God bless.",5
One of the worst services ever. Faced multiple times very late delivery. Where you try to cancel after a order doesn't get delivered after 2 hours and the support person says you can't cancel your order.,1
Should be given 0 star this is third time facing issue input location with door number & delivery done some where 1km away. what is the meaning of home delivery and we can't cancel because we paid earlier na then we have take delivery is which ever location delivery man tell,1
"Please ensure orders are complete. Incomplete orders are not acceptable. Salads come without lettuce, cheeseburgers come without cheese and Zomato valets say they are not allowed to check the orders... Why then am I using Zomato?",3
Price too high compare to directly going to hotel and get the food... For example Rs. 160 rs food in hotel you people charging Rs. 200 + delivery charges... Instead of ordering to you.. If we are near.. We can go and get...,1
"Such a bad experience in Zomato Last nyt. In this app we could not cancelled our orders , even if cancel the order full money will also changed. Waste app worst.. they don't satisfies the customers. People's don't use this app. I have worst experienced in my Birthday nyt.",1
Delivery is almost aways on time..and the app is pretty easy to use,5
"I like the apps a lot, but only the thing is there should be an option for cancelling order with certain amount deduction or charged in next order",4
"Horrible service, delivery boy takes multiple deliveries, and the food that is delivered is so cold that it's better no to have, after taking delivery charges and margin from seller, can they be less greedy, correct yourself before it's late",1
"Services of zomato are very poor, i have ordered from McD and as per the offer on zomato they are offering one Mac Aloo burger free on the order above 149 but after placing order it didn't get added in my bill summary due to their system fault and i didnt receive my complimentary order. Zomato is not ready to take it as complaint because as per them it was our mistake and we forgot to add the same. I am highly disappointed with Zomato.",1
The worst app that's all I can say They don't give enough offers or discounts to regular customers and they always forget an item if you have ordered more than 3 food.,1
zomato app crashes all the time and restaurants menu has not got all the items that the restaurant provides and payment gateway errors are frequently occuring . swiggy is way better than zomato Edit : The issue has been resolved. Thank you.,5
Orders are getting delayed ...shows less time while ordering ..but time for orginal delivery takes longer...price rates are going huge...nothing difference in taking zomato pro...delivery fee...delivery surge...tax...and want to order large amounts...,1
"Support chat is not working, support section is totally worst,",1
My order was not processed but i got charged..customer svs cannot do anythg i need to order again even though i was charged..they say they processed my refund..but no reference or receipt of processing..they say to take their chat as proof...big joke..waiting for my refund to unsubscribe and delete the app...better call the resto directly..a little hassle having cash on self..but more secure when it will come to customer svcs and assistance...,1
"Bad service and worst customer support. Even though you are a super member of Zomato, they will charge you for delivery. Without delivery support of particular restaurant and they are making orders. Swiggy is much better than Zomato at all level.",2
"totally disappointed today,,,,wrong order to show in their system or parcelling fault,whatever,,,,,one says call zomato and the zomato says,,we will solve your querry shortly,,and it all ends with a 50% loss compromise ,,,",1
Worst app in the world. After order is delivered there is customer response for incorrect order to complaint .swiggy is best in chat with customer than zomato.so guys go ahead to order food in swiigy. I think Zomato will stay max 1 year on platform .after that Zomato will go down in their business due to unproper maintenance . there is no customer to talk and chat regarding problem of order and worst app .Swiggy is so good and in maintain high standards,1
Kindly check the nevigation details. It's been an hour and my food is not delivered yet. This is happening for the 3rd time. If the food gets deliver such way then it's okay to go out and dine rather using this app,1
Use less customer support they told you guys that all the responsibility and concern is of resturent or the customer . There is no responsibility of zomato in any thing and nothing is in there hands. The cooking instructions or suggestion box is useless because not even a single time they follow those instructions. The zomato is only for making profit. Truly Grateful for you service .,1
Just updated my rating from 3stars to 1star...because the app keeps crashing..kindly dont try to fit 100 of features into the app..it has got very heavy and unstable....or better provide a lite version...,1
Worst experience 2times I ordered food and both the time delivery boy not able to found the adress.. although restaurant form where I ordered food hardly 2.5km away from my house..,1
zomato app was good but the cash payment only not satisfied for me other then all ok.,5
"Amazing app , And perfect and punctuality at there workers .",5
Horrible experience with Zomato yesterday I place one order after doing online pay payment and put OTP amount has debited from my bank account and just after that restaurant has shown that right now we can not process the order. My order also not placed and amount debited I emailed to Zomato team and do live no one is ready to take any action don't know when I will get the amount back to my bank account.,1
No change of 500 even though Zomato knew its a cash payment. The poor delivery guy had to go out for change. Zomato should inform the delivery guy that it's a cash payment so he doesn't have trouble. And even client doesn't have trouble.,1
"Such a pathetic service this has turned in to. Their agents have no idea whats going on with the order. No follow-ups, cant tell you an exact delivery time. Leaving this app.",1
"If order's discount increases, then automatically the quantity of the food will be decreased with significant delay. I'll never order here again. Uninstalled. 😤",1
Zomato at its service range is a good choice to get any available food around my suggestion is please don't include restaurant which doesn't have three stars for there food service...most of them are serving not so good food to get a parcel...,5
This app is better then swiggy. The delivery options are great. Also the voice notes which helps the delivery executive. As well as great offers.,5
"App is very nice. Customer care, very rude if they want business should be polite. Most of the delivery boy are not so polite.. whatever they are showing in the add. In reality totally different dish.. they are not providing accessories like salad , onion, etc.. Ayodhya not giving tissue paper... Fork, spoon ..etc",2
"I had applied zomato coupen before ordering, Zomato did not take it and charged me the full amount without any discount. I tried to cancel the order, but there was only this option ""i forgot to mention promo code"" and I have to give it even if I didn't wisj to. But zomato rejected my request saying we cannot cancel it food will be wasted, I must pay for it. This is complete fraud. First of all there was no proper option, nobody to listen what exactly happened and then decide. Very disappointed!!",1
This app is amazing and easy to place order and fast delivery but extra charge is very high and I think it's very helpful app for students and more.,4
"good service, reasonable price and discount",5
Great app for online ordering and quick service giving to their customers🙌😍😍,4
I couldn't collect the order at my doorstep. I had to walk 150 metres to collect the order. I gave the complete address than also this happened . Otherwise the experience was good with Zomato.,4
"don't order from them they will take your money, will not deliver your order, then put you on hold with the support for one hour and they will not let you cancel an order that 1 hour and 30 minutes late to keep your money,",1
"the food is good but packing is pathetic, not expected this from Hotel Tushar Elegant. Branding Value is zero. Also the valet is delivering food on a cycle. Zomato is not providing their valets with bikes and zomato packaging as done earlier or shown in ads. very bad experience.",1
"great food and ambience especially terrace top...They have a great variety in there menu, you can fing wround the world cusine served here..They have hand crafted beer one should try must it is best in town",5
"Really ,very very happy about the smart app ( zomato ) It working fast and nice app 👌👌👌",5
Despite of telling clearly in the instructions that not to use mushrooms in my meal. It was done. Neither any assistance was provided to me nor replacement or refund was issued. Pathetic service was provided Zomato.,1
Am reducing one star because some times many restaurants are not showing available to deliver on my area although they have showed their status as positive before one day or even before 1 to 2 hours backs.... Otherwise everything rest is good....,4
"Whether any offer is applied or not user can't understand, inspite of offer selection on portal while billing. It's very bad experience...",1
"ALWAYS PROMPT- ANY ORDERING MISTAKE GETS CORRECTED IN THE NEXT/SUBSEQUENT ORDERING- SUPERB EXPERIENCE- ONLY A FEW RESTAURENTS CHARGE MORE BUT NO COMPROMISE ON FOOD QUALITY. AAVIN PRODUCTS LIKE CHOCOLATES/SWEETIE are an added advantage. Unsersigned's hearty congradulations and salutations to Zomato Gold.Jai Hind. BHARATH MATA KE JAI, JAI KISAN, ""THAYE - TAMIZHE"".......... - CAPTAIN M ANEESAHMED",5
Had a pathetic experience with Zomato. I had order food from burger King which was supposed to be delivered at 9pm but arrived at 10.30 pm with the delivery man having no knowledge of the location.he arrived in cycle fluctuating the time every now n den.zomato offered me 200 rs complementary coupon my and wasting my 500 rs..and they expect me to order again to redeem 200 .. I have prepaid the amount else wouldn't have accept the order... kindly don't prepay dem as they ll take undue advantage,1
It's easy for you'll to charge a cancellation fee for an order just placed and request cancellation within a minute however I see you'll do not bother to compensate when the food is not prepared on time or the valet is yet to pick up the order....,1
i ordered my food which get delivered after 1:30 hour. n that too wasnt in condition to have. the tone of representative was very rude. Changing my review from 1 star to 5 star. Overall zomato is good,5
"Superb delivery, max safety, excellent experience after a long time 👍",5
Zomato is a fine food delivery destination easy to use ...thankyou,1
"This is the best online app for ordering food, I never faced difficult in anything. Like you just have to select the food you want and they deliver in time.",5
"Ok why are we asked to ""place this much worth of food because there is high demand etc"" to place order?? Remove this option kindly it is so unnecessary and it makes me annoyed.",1
"Worst food app, they asked for 45 min delivery but till now more than 1 hour is completed.... Also called multiple time to the rider bit his phone is busy...so not expect this food before 2 Hour or more than that",1
Very good app to order foood..I got my subway delivered in my hospital room during my covid treatment..today was my discharge from hospital..,5
"Very slow delivery I tried ordering for burger king twice in the past few months and it's been very late both the times, I'm literally waiting for my order right now it's already been an hour and a half since I placed the order.",1
Very good food app with offers and discounts. Good staffs with timely delivery. I like zomato much. Thanks a lot.,5
Worst app n service....it takes address by recomended location n the executives who come for delivery ....the phones are always busy n company never allows or gives Customer care numbers....the messages are auto generated....worst aoo...i lost money n also never good food delivered n also executive cooly said its cancelled....other Apps are better dont use this👎👎👎,1
I prompted app to send OTP more than 10 times no result. Perhaps some other form of verification (like through email) would be nice to add there if zomato have technical issues,1
"After updated all offers gone. Earlier minimum order was ₹129 for all offers, Now it shows ₹500 minimum order for offer. No 50% offers now only 20&30% offers.Very bad tactics. I uninstalled. Installed Swiggy app.",1
"I have been using this app for 1year and now deleting it now, worst ever service and very poor of choice, price are too High when I try to order, but person next to me orders same food by less amount. Such a cheater service they are providing",1
Writing this review for my bad experience on my order.I have ordered the food and delivery man got it on my location. He tried to call me my phone was ringing from his side but due to network problem my phone didn't rang on my side. So after 5 min cancelled my order. Customer support chat said that refund cannot be given as it's wastage of food. After this delivery boy ate the order. This is bad things eating from someone else's money they should have returned the order to hotelandverybadservice,1
"Wanted to edit an order withing 10 seconds of placing it , but couldnt do it and had to pay cancellation fee for that. They should atleast consider doing it for 2 min. Span",1
Zometo is very good with its services and offer . But most important is the food we are getting . I think that the quality of food restaurant providing to online user is 3rd grade . I have never received a wow from online deliveries.,1
easy to use and can find anything here .,4
"First order, came late n cold. Also pasta which was initially placed however it was not available and had to compromise for garlic bread which was not cooked properly inside. Disappointed.",1
"Unethical practice. Charging people more than 35 rupees in the name of surge charges if they order less. That too during morning hours where very less people order. Also you have increased the rate of each itemand then you show heavy discount on them. It's very ridiculous that Just because you deliver the food so that we don't have to go out doesn't give you right to charge out of your mind amount. I suggest you stop looting people, or else people will move to your competitors.",1
Your service is too slow and pathetic got a wrong order on 14th March 21 and you guys haven't done anything till now. Don't waste your money in this app this is worst platform I have ever seen no customer support is here no response from this app worst food delivery app. It's been four days now and I haven't received a response from their end till date. They are fooling people. Charging much money and sending the incorrect items.,1
App crashes when I put item in cart..new update has resulted in this,5
Good and prompt service with cooperative delivery partner's.,5
"Best app for ordering food online. Zomato continues to delight with its service quality, delivery and innovation within the app to capture the feedback on all aspects of food, service, taste, quality. Kudos to the Zomato team for paying attention to details. Keep up the good work and more power to your business for more growth.",5
ZOMATO is just for receiving money.. If there's any issue with the order then we just receive a message that you can call the restaurant directly and the best part is the call never gets through. We cannot even talk to ZOMATO executives only chat on the name of support.,1
"1. They increase the amount of order with abnormal price. 2. No customer care, forexample once u get wrong order, u just chat with a bot and they will tell wait 24-48 hours. How can hungry person wait that much?",1
The app has undergone significant improvement and update since last time. Lightning fast delivery with lots of discounts and excellent food quality. Very good and I am very satisfied with this app. Also I like the feature which displays the current body temperature of the delivery guy.,5
Medium scrambled egg continues to be inconsistent. Managers service is less than professional- forgetting to provide feedback. I feel taken advantage of.,1
"Yet to order from Zomato. Had very great experience here eating Egg Rice, Egg Masala and Egg roll. Very economic, higiene and quick service.",5
Food taste is good and list of restaurants are also good but coming to Delivery charges are too high. With that delivery charges we can buy one more item. Just for 3km they are charging 50 rupees of delivery charge,3
It's such a worst app they charge us extra for orders as menu price is different from the actual hotel rate .. but they never deliver the food the app sucks big time and there customer service is even worst. Zomato is white collar beggers ...,1
This very simple order to food . So I will give five stars,5
Cant rate less than 1 star they are not responsible for the food you have ordered it might reach you on time or it might not get delivered at all. So good luck with it.,1
"Worst experience since last 3 weeks. We order food by observing ratings of restaurants on this aap but since last 3 weeks my experience would be worst. So, We have decided to start using swiggy from today itself.",1
"Once upon a time we want parcel food from restaurants we need to go and visit the restaurant,but nowadays zomato is there for everyone so no traffic, no time waste,no fuel waste,etc.....happy",5
I waited for more than 1 hour and when I received my order it was cold like beer. After research I got to know that Zomato assigned 2 different orders placed at different time to the same Valet. Fix it or you'll lose all your customers.,1
"Zomato has lowered it's quality. I am using zomato for 4 years, but from last one month they have caused lots of inconvenience. Food spillage, food missing, low quality food. And I have proof. I am gonna uninstall it and use something else",2
"ordered two chicken biryani and had successfully done the payment, even got the sms from sbi, still the app said ""transaction failed, payment was incomplete"". fix your app and confirm my delivery as soon as possible otherwise i'll be forced to move to the consumers court.",1
(NOT RECOMMENDED app)iWhat's the purpose of Pro/Gold any membership when you have to pay DELIVERY CHARGE which used to be FREE with membership as it was earlier. Most of the time delivery asset don't carry hotbag at least for pizza I do prefer but I'm disappointed as I've given my money for service I do not get ever . There is nothing I can say which is a real benefit of PRO.i literally feel wasted my money to purchase Pro in other family devices and regretting.,1
"Great food ,great menu and excellent offers only on Zomato.",5
"Pathetic customer service. Dominos missed delivering some items. Zomato refused to give back credits for it. Useless customer service. If you have the option, please use Swiggy or other platforms !!!!!",1
Had to call the restaurant for items not listed. Very un-friendly app. Can do much better.,2
Better app for minimal deliveries with cash on delivery option.,5
"Everything is superb but the punctuality it sucks.....i ordered the food it gave me 55 minutes of time for delivering the food and aftr fifteen minutes when I again checked, it's showing the same time and it sucks..... I'm waiting for my food....☹️and u r teasing me by showing tht time....",4
"This was my first order from Zomato and i personally recommend try once.Awesome food, Great packing, on time delivery.however I order late night still got on time and every thing was on expectations.",5
Worst food delivery app Today only I have faced 2 times quality and quantity of food. ...worst quality they r providing tasteless food waste os money nd time don't use this app,1
"This app shows lesser delivery time before and then always always increase it imidiately after placing order it's just a tactic to intrap customers once order is place what can one do but to wait,atleast swiggy tells corrct time more it may be",1
It provide good service. Delivery is on time. most of the restaurant’s are tied up with Zomato which will increase the service quality.,5
Takes too much time to just assign a delivery agent. Impossible to reach out to anyone for support and no phone number has been provided for any instant queries or instant resolution for an issue,2
Awesome app for food orders. With good discount coupons,4
I ordered something from one restaurant and I costed me 300 ruupees and I don't understand... Why not even a single customer support is not working... And when ever I am trying to call I line seems always busy this is the worst experience I ever have ...and huge waste of amount...,1
"I think Zomato is food delivery platform, so they have to make sure food is delivered is proper condition. I have ordered pizzas today and they were delivered completely smashed. When I asked for refund they denied.",1
I'm first time used this app Worst experience I'm not recommend this app delivery times is the very worst part when I start ordering the delivery time show is 31 min and food Delivered 1 an 1/2 hour and food is totally cold.,1
Zomato offers discouts which is good but the rate chart is high. If you are visiting the outlet you will get the same order for less amount which will be less from what zomato offers after all discounts.,1
"By mistake if the wrong delivery address is selected, then the agent doesn't have facility to change the address from backend even though distance is same or less for new address.",1
Most delivery times given on the app are inaccurate This makes the order process like a lottery Chat support only reply set answers without any effort to address the question,2
"I have been a pro member for very long time never have I got this sub par quality from any brand. The app doesn't even recognize me as a pro member even though it shows me I have pro membership. There's no on time or free delivery, no customer support, no perks of pro member. Never gonna renew this again in my life.",1
Nice experience it have all type of food i am not go any place food but in zomato ot like that i am roaming and eat all state food in our house with discount i tell to zomato that you imprpve that in 50 order you will give 1 food to our choice free thats it thx zomato nice taste so pls work on it that i am tell pls in but not in card you give all the to cash on delivey also if we dont know our card no. Supose so i have cash so there is a thing i manage it in cash so pls work on it thx zomato❤❤,5
The resturant taxes are very high ..and delivery charges are also high due to climatic conditions...but there is so such climatic conditions here.zomato has to focus on these things if they want to increase there app users,2
"Zomato to me is becoming too large to handle,over last few instances have clearly suffered with deliveries from Zomato including bad quality of food and overall experience...No one is ready to take even customer response seriously to improve experience...as it is happening time and again!!",3
Awesome food delivery app. I have never felt like wasting any minute opf time after ordering anything on Zomato. Its providing just an amazing service. Your order will always get delivered on proper time without any hustle. The favorite thing is they will recommend the best rated restaurants nearby and will provide you with the same items that you check on the app. It's just fricking amazing. Kudos to ZOMATO.,5
The delivery charges and not known external charges are very high...that make us not order again,1
"Very very bad experience with service, i was going to uninstall the app I was ordered food from Zomato, There is no food in restaurant but the restaurant accepted my order, I was asked to cancel my order But Zomato customer service executive was not cancelled my order finally food delevered after 1 hour after delivery i was started eating and food is half boiled and worst and i was reported to the customer service executive but there is no response",1
Too many extra charges and less discounts. Some restaurant is saying delivery available in my app while it shows not available for delivery in my flatmates app for same address!!,1
"previously I love ordering food from this app but after I purchased Zomato pro membership, may be due to some technical issues I am not able to apply any promo codes to my and it's not even showing a promo code. Zomato should look into this as this is a blunder issue I have ever met on Zomato",1
My always go to food delivery app.... Easy handling,5
"I order Idli from Sagar Ratna, in sagar ratna menu price is ₹125 but zomato shows ₹160 and delivrey charge extra. I'll never use zomato, anyone should not use that also.",1
I am tired! Tired using this buggy app. Tired waiting for 2 hours for my order because of some stupid glitch. Tired of shelling out money and not receiving anything and then having to run behind the customer care for refund. No more!! No more wasting my time and money on this app. Thank you Zomato!! Thanks a lot!,1
Many times when you order they put minimum order criteria which is quite high?? How can you order extra food then you can eat?? Wat sense does it make.. Very stupid strategy..,2
"I dont why but the delivery is very slow.. I waited nearly 1 and a half hour but no sign. The app too has some problem, I couldn't live track.",1
It's a very good app but it has a lot of taxes included..,2
Simply adds extra things like tipping donations options to co fuse and distract user while paying. Don't understand why the heck we have to tip via app after paying delivery charges. If I have to tip I will tip him or her in person. Stupid options do one business and do it at best,1
Worst App...even after putting complete address delivery person went 2 -3 km away. Delivery person was also helpless as he did not receive any help from Zomato Team Leader... Zomato needs to improve address & delivery preferences. Will prefer Swiggy any time.,1
"Not Good, I purchased 3 months pro and changed the device and there is activation code needed and do not know where the code is and was unable avail the benefit and also there is no chat option available no complaint option",3
"Amazing experience, order delivered on exact time and food is so tasty and yum 😋",5
Getting better by time! I had so many horrific experience with Zomato till 2019 that I started using it minimum. Now it is definitely getting better and hope it continues this way.,4
Delivery charges are often more than the original price of the food 😑 hate this thing ..otherwise its a good app ...but high delivery charges sucks,2
Perfect. Can show more restaurants within 6-10km vicinity and maximum restaurants basis choice of Dish. It will be good if we can also display ratings of Restaurants from some reliable source outside of Zomato.,5
Awesome food delivery app. No one can compete with Zomato. But guys please reduce your taxes and delivery fee. Delivery fee was charged 50+ just for an 150 order amount.Thats disappointing.,3
Zomato customer service is tooo worst. How can we raise a complaint when we have problem with delivered food?.. Recently placed an order in Zomato and the item received is a Stale food nd the customer support was too worst so that they won't interact with us to address a complaint.,1
Simple and easy to handle app with exciting offers,5
"They couldn't deliver an order in 2 hrs, swiggy did it in 20 mins. Also their customer care provide the false information about the status.",1
Now a days the reviews and ratings they show are of no help i think so and their pro membership is of no use they say for pro members 25% discount. But there is condition in it the discount is applicable only for orders above 300. They should also clearly say that.,1
Seriously didn't expect this to Zomato I was waiting for my order like a fool! And after 40 mins it cancelled my order and say we didn't find any delivery boy despite of being a 'pro member' this thing happened to me.,1
i m not satisfied every time i order but hotel staff is not providing me a good and fullfill order. Zomato is not good i waste my time with them he says delivered in 35 min but it tooks 1 hours to deliver this and many more times there driver is also gone. Joke is that they also don't no where is driver and they transfer delivery to another driver.,1
Compare with another app... this app is so good. Price of the food is cheaper than other app. The delivery of food on time. I like the delivery boys attitude. They are very humble and the serve the food on time and at the door step 👍👍👍👍👍👍,5
Very bad experience with zomato. We received the order 1 and half hour late with wrong quantity and poor quality of food. We were supposed to receive free order and the agent denied it after wasting our time.,1
Comparative to Rajahmundry locality Zomoto is very good. I didn't faced any problem till date. But Reply on Roumers regarding food/Corona effect to be advertised properly.,4
"A lot of difference in prices when compared to restarunt prices with app prices , if restaurant price is 70rs app showing as 120rs , why is this happening?",1
Very bad app.no customer support Gets hang all the time Please update it. I have recive 1 item missing in my order I try to complain but customer support not working.how we suppose to contact zomato if we dint get what we order.app was to bad.,4
Wonderful app for ordering food and dining out. Starting to order after a year. The app is very smooth to use.,5
Server error while updating photograph for food quality and quantity complaint,4
Very bad. Accidentally I made an order with Zomato and they made me to wait one hour then they said there was an unexpected issue. And the customer care lady was so arrogant while speaking. I am giving one star only because of the customer care lady. Such a pathetic service,1
ZOMATO WAS perhaps the better food app with huge options to choose from uncountable restuarants & good joints BEFORE COVID. The delivery boys now are WORST. I've one valuable suggestion to ZOMATO authority ...Taste food yourself first & then register the food joints ... At least we can save ourselves from having stale & rotten food .....,1
"Very worst experience I had today with zomato. My order is placed and to confirm my order I called to delivery boy and he is very rude in the call. And saying I did not received the order, why are you asking me... Zomato don't encourage these types of activities.. I think customers experience matters a lot for you.",1
"I am santhosh. And I am ordered a biryani pack( chicken dum biryani and chicken 65 biryani). And the chicken dum biryani is very bad in condition. The chicken pice is not cooked properly and it was raw, some kind of bad small is coming from my order. I am given a complaint of my order to zomato. It is responding and not even reply for problem it is so bad of this app. My friends for your batter option don't use this app. And the delivery boy are not good in communication.",1
It is the worst app i have used. I have order a food but their valet ask me to cancel this order bcz he can not make up to and i already made a payment. After i cancel this order they refund only half of the amount. They are just looting the customers.,4
"Very bad experience in breakfast section, taking more time than showing time in order. Hotel didn't listen Zomoto valet person.. hotels are not giving preference to zomoto app. Waste service from you. Take this is as a serious compliant.. and provide better service to customers.",2
Zomato as always has been good. amount on restaurants on the app is substantial. also the discounts n offers are most of the Times better than what the restaurant itself can offer.,4
Worst service Zomato even don't know how to respond to a customer And they don't have solutions for customer problems. What a great service... good keep going like that,1
"When a restaurant updates menu or adds new special dishes, please try to flash them. Ordered dinner on 4-March-21. Promised time was 47 minutes. Zomato agents refused to go to the restaurant. Followed with Zomato. One and half hour after placing order at around 10:15 Zomato cancelled the order. Very unprofessional Why order on zomato for such bad service and attitude. Didn't get food for the order. Zomato charges higher prices than on restaurant delivery menu. Doesn't give restaurant offers. Sad",1
"Let me tell you, Zomato may keep you hungry..this has happened with me many times..so I am done with Zomato....they have no command over their valets...the valets may deliver your food cold or they make take as much time as they want...no one can force them to do anything...and you can only chat with the customer care...and representatives are helpless..",1
They take too long time to just assign a delivery executive perhaps they should allow some rating options for their services on every order. Otherwise They have very bot like interactions with very delayed responses.,2
Poor performance for order placed today. Contact number given for delivery boy was of someone unknown for the number given. Delivery time also showing constantly 10 -12 mins for past about 30 mins.,1
"Very good app, helps to order food from almost all the restaurants near me. App interface is very user friendly and helps us to decide on what food we want. The small chat-like notifications are fun and reminds us that zomato cares for their customers.",5
"More than double charge on every item. no use of discount. Order directly from restaurant, every restaurant offers free delivery now a days. Don't use zomato.",1
"Very bad, the app doesn't open only please fix this as soon as possible",1
"New policy has been designed keeping in mind...how to loot the customer or the delivery person,....if there is Problem with the order...then too delivery executive is blamed and charged with...but happens to the restaurant.",1
"If we want to order 1 item of less than 100rs then it applies a lot of tax and makes it of 170rs. Its very costly to buy a cheap item on zomato. Already the prices of item are more than actual price of the same item on restaurant. And on that zomato applies multiple taxes.Suppose if an item is of 40rs on restaurant, then on zomato it will be of 60rs and on that zomato will apply multiple taxes and if we want to order that single item then it will cost around 120rs including all the nonsense tax",1
if you order briyani and Chicken 65 in same order They ask us to pay delivery charge for briyani separately and delivery charge for chicken 65 seperate 🤣🤣Very brilliant strategy,1
Food received was so spicy can't even eat. Quantity is also very less still I didn't get any refund. I keep on texting that connect to an agent but no action taken. Very dissapointed. The customer support provided with this app is very bad.,5
Location is pathetic. Never got a proper delivery without a series of to-and-fro calls with the delivery guys. Should work on tracking locations properly for a delivery agent like this.,1
"The app is well enough you guys need to work on reach...add an option like ""Do you have an oven? because the restaurant you selected is too far."" You guys could add the delivery charge!!!",5
"App is good, convenient, easy to use but i have seen zomato charging nearly double the price on food over some hotels though the delivery spot is minutes away..",3
Very poor delivery it takes more than one hour to deliver food. My home is just 4-5 km away from restaurant.,1
Worst Customer service even for a small issue I need to message and wait for 10+ minute and will get only one reply sorry for the inconvenience stupid app,1
Too poor chat support. They wast time not give solution. Zomato support and services system is not working properly not trust on it. Too boring and unuseful service,1
"Prices are too high and charges also high not worthy for it,its telling on time or free food but I was watching from 5 min its showing 45min, time is not moving at all , don't cheat the customer zomato..",2
And thier del account work flow... After clicking on del account one gets an intermediate screen for feedback.. best of luck if you can submit your feedback there as keypad would not just open.. techically challenged company i am using device with andriod os..,1
"I have stopped eating pizzas from any other place as rarely u get this quality and service. I recommend u to try their pizzas, it is a new set up but they have fresh bread and plenty of toppings. Chicken loaded and meat all around is my favourite.",5
"Very cheapest company ever.. hope uber eats closed, swiggy not performing, zomato think he is the leader. I am sure sooner u will close ur shutter..no compromise this is third time I was felt that I was charged extremely twice the price of product. Better to beg instead of doing this job. Don't say as a service.",1
Zomato is best in my area swiggy and dominoz not come but Zomato comes I love Zomato it deliver on time accurately and not cheat by the photo,5
Doesn't work well at checkout.... It's really slow,2
Very friendly. Specially liked the option of instructions related to food preparation .people with allergies will be benefited immensely.,5
Very bad customer care service. They also don't know whether the order is place or not. After only they help when customer put a complaint that oder is not received in last 2 hr then only they contacted. After also contacted they told you can cancel the order. Are baba aise hi krna hai to app close krva do plz cancel the order. Order cancel krne k liye krte hai kya.,1
Everything was perfect with my order delivery but delivery boy wasn't wearing uniform so for that 4 star..,4
Worst return policy....i had placed an order by mistakenly and then i instantly wanted to cancel the order... Zomato was saying your is already getting prepared..i mean how it is possible that within 30 seconds hotel started making my food and when i wanted them go cancel my order they was saying 80rs will be charged...what is the use of Zomato pro membership..grow up guys,1
"Worst app. They people don't value time and if a person with busy schedule expecting the food to get delivered on time, sorry but they people totally get failed . Not recommending at all.",1
Not able to give ratings for the delivery persons in the latest update.,3
"zomato is increasing prices of food and delivery charges are very higher, some times they charge 70-80 rupees on a distance of 2 km. it seems they are monopoly in this sector, so they are taking the advantage by raising food prices day by day. also zomato pro is of no use. they hardly give discount.",1
Superb job by delivery boy and foods are very delicious and fantastic ...,4
"Everything is aswm , but i suggest the company to make a audit team to check the quality of food in every resturant in every week, Zomato is a very big company, so it is not impossible to make an audit tema. Because sometime the quality of the food from the restaurant are not good , i khow u give refunds to customer if that happens but customer orders food when customer is hungry. Regards Debajyoti",5
I love Zomato's customer support.... The customer service is very supportive and the best thing is that they follow up any kind of delay in the delivery very seriously. Apart from this the user interface of the app is quite good. SO GREAT 👍🏻,5
"lifesaver. Amazing user interface, lots of options and great deals. That's all we want from a food aggregator. Continue to enhance our user experience and add in more offers",5
"I have tried placing an order with one Madeena hotel Bannerghatta road but seems the discount is 20% whereas it's 40% with its other 3 outlets... Why is this the case? The discount should be the same in all the outlets, also the price is 20rs extra as compared to dine in prices",1
One of the worst apps wherein the live chat doesn't work and gets hanged frequently.,1
Helpful app for food lovers at reasonable price.,5
good but sometimes offer is not working receive via phone pe transaction..,4
no gud coordination between restaurants and zomate.. they charge for delivery but don't take it seriously...,1
It is a good app. But it takes order twice thrice...aap issue. Sometimes even if transaction rejected then too order gets confirmed but sometimes not....so i 2 stars only,2
Does not resolve issue sent to them over email. If they reply then only copy pasted draft they send. Not addressing the issue posed by the customer and just avoid it.,1
"I love Zomato but after the latest update it's constantly crashing, when ever i open the app it works for 5sec then suddenly crashes ,please fix this problem ASAP!!!",5
"Extremely bad service, don't ever use their services they don't even care about the feedback, most of the time food reach cold In very bad conditions, always late and don't even answer the messages and no one is able to help on phone",1
"Recently I ordered subs and beverages from Subway. I received the subs though the beverages were missing. Then I called subway and the delivery person both told to complain to zomato, I tried doing so on the app. Firstly the app doesn't let you call the customer care people and secondly while chatting with their complaints bot, it was not showing the beverages items to select in my order. Bill on the parcel had those items mentioned and I had paid for all 4 things. Very disappointed with this.",1
"poorest service in the world! first they delay the order unnecessarily, then they add a stupid refund without your approval!! absolutely pathetic experience!!!",1
There is 50 to 60% off on almost every restaurant but code is not visible so there is no benifit of downloding this app.Im very disappointed with this app zomato.,1
The one thing that needs to be corrected is in case the customer doesn't get food from Dominos the solution has to be immediate n not ask to wait for 2 days. I neither got food nor my money.,1
"The new update looks Very cunning. showing 50% off upto 100, but only show 10% off while adding promotion",1
This app is now becoming worst as they are taking so much delivery charges as well as they show promo code but that rate with promo code is higher than the actual resturant rate WORST APP,5
If order from zomato they never delivered food and delivered person also not pick the call and zomato person also not responding properly. I faced more than 3 times for same issue. Worst experience 😪. Pl use other platform to order food.,1
My chat feature never works. I get a blank page the moment I click on support/chat and zomato doesn't have a call feature. In short I don't have an option to get in touch with them. Can somebody help?,1
"Pathetic service from zomoto, they fool you with false promises. Their responses to chat is very late. They answer with some standard words, don't understand your concern. Restaurant Phone numbers given in their site mostly not work. They will not talk to restaurant people if needed. On a whole hopeless service..avoid it",1
Very quick services on delivery fooe but no customer care service support given properly,2
Worst experience i had with this zomato...no refund and no concellations ...to call resturants those numbers are also not working better use swiggy guys ....,1
"I ordered one food in zomato.that delivery is fast..the delivery takes just less than 30 min..I thank to zomato,and the polite and good delivery man,and his service and etc.,.,I think this app is more better than other food delivery apps..😊😊👍👍🤟🤟🤟🙂.one more thanks to zomato and that delivery man who delver that food to me..🙏🙏",5
Wrong address is updated by mistake. I wanted to cancel the order.But Zomato did do that. Instead they forced to accept the order on the same address. Bad support,1
Good service and fastest super fast and good delivery,5
I ordered a Dominoes pizza from Zomato. Since I did not get the delivery even after 1 hour of delivery I requested to cancel the order. My request was denied by support executive. I got the pizza after 1.5 hrs of ordering it and had to eat the cold pizza. This not only resulted in my loss of money but also tarnished the image of both the brands. If Zomato can not vouch for the services of Dominoes why do they endorse it on their app? I wanted the refund/cancellation from Zomato since I paid them,1
Worst facilities with worst valets with worst customer support. Vallet just takes your food cancelling your order own their own and what you get in return of your order is refund request is generate you will recieve the amount withing 5 to 7 days. That's not what I needed I needed the food on time.,1
I feel sometimes Promo codes are misleading because when there is a offer delivery chargers will be more! I don't understand that! That need to taken care of!,5
They purchased the amount without placing my order and I tried to call them more than 15 times with no answer and they didn't refund my money back. very bad service and if I can rate them with no even 1 star I will do that.,1
It is a very useful and a good app for food delivery and feeding many of homeless children 😍😍,5
"Required improvements as during pendamic( Covid19/Coronavirus) required to set some strict guidelines for seller, dont accept and send open food to customer.",3
No contact number and no proper response if we are facing problem by delivery boy. Delivery boy Sunil Uttekar from last one hour didn't delivered the order. And also kept his phone switched off for long time when it's assigned to him... Very disappointed ☹️,3
Sucks! I orderes yesterday they gave me half my product! I ordered today and i waited for 1 hour and they cancelled my order. By then it was too late to order anything else as the restaurants had all closed,1
"Whenever I order anything but using this app, the restaurant takes too much time in delivering the order. Today, more than 2 hours are passed, still food is being prepared at restaurant.",1
This is not regarding the app it's regarding there service. Please never order from Zomato. The customer service is the worst they don't solve the issue but they ask for extra evidence for the issue although you have provided picture for the bad food to them already. Never install it on your phone and please never order from it. They are the worst and wastage of time and money,1
Very bad app. Guys please don't use this app for any order. use swiggy it's better than zomato. No immediate customers service available...... First we have to chat with stupid bots to raise the issue. And after that they take to long time to respond in chat box. And they also not resolving your problem properly. If some food are missing or have spoilage issue they just replying sorry for inconvenience. That's it no matter what the issue they just replying like bots sorry for inconvenience.,1
Easy to navigate. keeps us updated on the status of the order. Only glitch in the app is that we cannot see where the delivery agent has reached in the map tracking,5
Very bad app for allergic people. Does not provide refund if food instructions are followed. I don't get why I am paying for food I can't eat. Just waiting for Amazon to launch their delivery service,1
Very user friendly app no complications easy to place order and avail discounts but Zomato should work on the delivery charges as per the distance and also the discounts given on the orders..,4
Fast delivery and help me to get food in critical situation. One of the most important service provided by the app and its developers and obviously the co-workers and delivery persions. Salute to them.,5
There is only one complaint from me....Please improve your navigation of zomato vehicle when the order is picked up. For around 15 minutes his location is near the restaurant and suddenly from nowhere he is near my house...Please solve this issue.,4
Good App to showing quality of foods & help people to find their delicious dish.,5
Waste app... didn't get any response from 4 hour's... wasted my money wasted time.. wasted food..,1
Now a days zomato became late order valueshould be 130 rup i think if they stop adds in you tube and give more discounts customers no need ads,2
Worst experience Whenever i order something Something goes wrong everytime So many times i ordered but i never got my food Uninstalling.,1
"All the orders till now are delivered on time, following all precautions.",5
Absolutely ridiculous service!!! Forwarded an issue to their escaltions team and ZERO assistance received!!! Have not placed a single order with Zomato or Talabat since and do not intend on doing so!!,1
Very pathetic app and service. I waited for 2 hours for my food order still it was not delivered. Useless app and service. I should have given you 0 stars..will switch to swiggy and food panda,1
Good Service and delivery in time.,5
Many more Time service is good but less they delivery charges 🤯,5
Very worst experience ever I've faced. I have placed an order from chicking. They mentioned it will be delivered by 45 min. But its delivered by very late. More than 2 hours late. Sometimes don't trust them,1
"I just order my food, my order is ready but there is no rider to deliever my order, & not a single person of company informesld me that.. So i hv to wait my order for next 45 min more..We use this app to save our time not to waste our time.. Worst service.. No resposibilty by this comapny..",1
New version is a lot better then the previous one.. previous one had a lot of glitches.. I'm quite happy with the new version and with the services too.,5
Pathetic Service. Swiggy is better. I compared many times. Always there is an issue,1
"The order gets changed, what you order will never come in exact quantity as of which you ordered for worst service with no consumer help policy. Making fools and then trying to show genuine concern as if they care. To all of us don't download the app if possible and if u r stuck in any situation then use it at least count as much as you can.",1
"Such a pathetic service, I ordered for chicken pizza but they delivered normal one👿😡 cheaters fist time I ordered in this app and horrible service it was, I paid 300 but delivered 60rs pizza how could you guys do this, frauders👿👿👿 never gonna use this app in my life and I'll tell my frnds not to use this horrible app. Cheaters",1
Best delivery app till date I always prefer zomato over swiggy Delivery is on time perfect Valets are polite and respectful even in lockdown they delivered my order at doorstep hatsoff to them. Zomato was of great help during lockdowns due to the cravings and also due to Ramzan fasts during iftari. I recommend it to my friends always.,5
App is totally Confusing..Old one was user friendly. Zomato is very costly compared to Swiggy.,1
"Very poor after sale service. I ordered food from this application, received on time but half of my food was spilled. I told my problem to executive but there is no response from the company.",1
Today my friend faced very bad experience after ordering with Zomato.. After placing order and doing continuous follow-up untill 2 hours the food wasn't delivered. This is very bad experience and i shall uninstall the app and make sure to switch to other apps for food delivery. Very bad experience.. PATHETIC SERVICE.. TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOUR.. NOT ACCEPTABLE AT ALL.. 😡😡😡,1
"Not so good. Offers are worst and facing issues with the payment most of the times. Swiggy is a bit better while compared with payments. Evaluate, if possible!",2
"I keep trying to upload reviews but it doesn't get uploaded, it shows in the notification that it's uploaded but cannot see on dineline. I've done everything i can. I reinstalled and cleared data and cache. Still its same!! Disgusting",1
Only thing which I observed personally is the delivery charges are too high. It should be minimal so that we could afford to place more orders,4
Don't get proper notifications from their side ever...they always ask you to get a bank statement and check it...yeah that's all I do the whole day...a simple refund message they can't give you..very poor customer care..not helpful at all,1
"App is good. But there's a glitch ! It takes address of last order ""by default"" for next every order. I think app should ask confirmation about address before placement of current order . ( Specially when Someone has multiple addresses in address book.)",4
"Not worthy of even 1 star, it has always disappointed me with quality of restraint they onboard. It is all about membership fees from them and when it comes to improvement, they always blame delivery guys who are at no fault and are trying to earn honest living . Zomato u are now on downward spiral and I will pray that you get thrashed to ground to pieces.",1
Good one for food delivery and easy to order,5
"Very bad suport. The order get cancelled, even the delivery boy is in the building, and I am there and support is so pathetic that it can't solved it. And I endup wasting an hour.",1
Prices are sometimes more expensive than actual price at restaurant. Delivery charge on top of it make things worse.... but overall good service. 👍,3
"Gold member delivery is absolute scam, quantity reduced when you apply Gold membership for 1:1 free... Small unhygienic kitchen or small dabawala are listed on higher price to show discount... Why don't Zomato actually post premise/restaurant/kitchen picture with menu scan copy with listing for transparency for food buyers... Now they are fooling customer in name of packaging of 35/- per order and 35/- delivery charges",1
Zomato..it's happening multiple times that I am going to get cold food...I was quite because I feel one should give time to improve...but seems like no improvement A cold food delivery app...😔,2
"With the new update, they recklessly screwed up 50% of the layout. Everything takes 10 seconds longer to find and feels so crowded.",3
"Just there...one suggestion though.. jus before payment in the offers zone, the one shown as recommended is one that is mostly not applicable",5
Now all the promo codes has been taken off...n prices compared to restaurants are too high...in some its double...which i have seen personally....waste to download n use...delivery charges 40 for tax 12 rs what the hell is this... Then what usefull home delivery.... N such an adding senselessly...,1
Was a pro user. Zomato just doesnt care anymore. Shows all wrong delivery times and never penalises the restaurants for sending worse possible food post covid times. We are just getting ripped off everytime we order. Swiggy seems to do the job much better.,1
The refund process gets delayed and problem is not solved quickly. Worst app. I would personally suggest people to not order food from zomato instead they should move to some other alternative options,1
The worst Live chat support. Utterly useless. No real time support is available. Disappointing to the level the company has gone down. From my favourite to my least liked. Kudos Zomato!,1
Quick delivery and budget menu is available..,5
"Discrepancy in menus pricing and simultaneously overpriced with tied up restaurents here @ Kolkata. Applicable taxes on food is very high though. Zomato management, need to reconsider and think it over likewise. Simultaneously, Zomato apps, GPS should be very lagged free and very accurate like Uber Inc. Thanks.",5
"This has happened 3-4 times in a row that zomato has failed to deliver food properly. Sometimes, food is spilled. Cake is smashed. Order particulars are missing",1
They say on time or free..I did not ask them to give free food..now if the food is free they ask you to claim ..but they don't mention that it's only be valid for 7 days or they take back your money 💰💰.. That means it's not free..... cheaters and frauds.i will from now on try swiggy.,1
Love it.... But some locations are not included... thats the sad part... Otherwise Happy with Timely delivery... Awesome offers.... Neat & clean packing... Good one team... Keep it up 👍👍👍,4
Worst. As customer executive are not responding. Even order got delayed for more than 90 mins. Very bad experience.,1
"Very bad policy of refunding as Zomato promo for wrong/rotten food order,when I am paying from my account then it should refund to that place only,why are you refunding as promo and that too with a condition that have to be used within 30 days,it's my money who are you to decide to use it in 30 days or 60 days or in a year....it's a very disgusting policy Zomato...deciding not to go with you next time better go for other delivery partner like swiggy",1
I tried to order food around 1k from zomato but it says order above 300 need to be paid online. Whats the difference? You're getting commision and the restaurant is making money at the same time. From best food ordering app to worst. Can't say I'm not disappointed with how you guys are updating your services.,1
Worst app. Money deducts but no service. If your restaurant partners can not accept orders why do you guys keep tsking oreders. Old tactics of showing business by holding money eithout providing money. Will you give me the interest of said period. Degenerated over the years..,1
Very bad experience as you charge too much on the name of delivery charge and delivery surge. Why two different names? Just take it once. If I ll have to order food 3 times a day what should I do? Better to start my bike use my fuel and get my food. Why should I use Zomato?,1
not bad service but one problem not a order cancelled option,3
"It is a good app with less delivery charges and I wanted to change the order placed I asked them whether I could change it but they said it can't be changed but then I called the restaurant. They helped me the order , next time just try if u(@zomato) could add an option to customize the order rest was good👍",4
A very refined app.. Food orders made easy! Though the promo codes don't seem to make any difference in the total amount.,4
"I went there with a bunch of friends to spend some good time as it had been very long that we met during to corona... Wanted a nice place with good seating area, ambience and most importantly yummy food... Tjis place is very good for all our need... We ordered crispy corn 🌽, 1947 veg platter for starters... Panneer patiala & Royal tomato 🍅curry with assorted Indian breads for our main course.. ordered veg pulav raitha for add on... Ended this yummy meal with chocolate sizzling brownie!!!",5
Great platform to search for best tastes and great prices....Would appreciate if zomato gives users privilege to rate and review restaurants and the information be provided in public domain. Thumbs Up to great service with easiest interface.....,5
Customer experience is good it's better than swiggy platform immediate and instant response and resolution Personally I suggest you to order through this platform rather than any other platform.,5
"Waste waste waste support work, in application if raised complain than only taking feedback and on mail only getting mail revert within 24 or 48 hours but no reply waste totally waste, I will never recommend to anyone, better to use another application.",1
The only problem is delivery charge is very high else best app👍,5
Pathetic food and rates are too high now....from last few months the prices are way to high on Zomato for all products and the offers are only for cheap restaurants....also they never take feedback seriously...they don't refund money to Customers and also don't pay to restaurants....no one can trust zomato,1
The support is really really bad. I am requesting all not to use this app to order anything as I am having issues with 4 orders in a row back to back. Their support team is a bunch of foolish who will not even listen to your issue and will give you nonsense resolutions,1
"I gave 1 star because when we change our address it won't change.and when we give real prize money to delivery boy they will ask more money and in the app we can see 60 off when we click on that there is no coupon is not available in the app.....why ....iam asking why,,,...",1
The biggest Cheats in the FMCG industry where we cannot connect to the supprot and we have to wait and pay advance and they will ultimately say write to us we will get back to you,1
"Better than similar application in many things, but one thing which is lacking that it doesn't provide free delievery. Not even to the zomato gold members.",4
It is not good at all. Chat support agent is not solving our issues and went idel in between the chat. We are very disspointed,1
Delivery time shown will be 15 minutes but actually the delivery will be done after 20 minutes. Late delivery every time I suppose to use experience the same problem..,3
Very bad the customer service experience is very bad they reply in a robotic way instead of solving the problem. They reply only few fix ways and don't reply you. At last they only regret about the customer bad experience.,1
I found my order within 30 minutes with all covid precautions during lockdown period. It's good,5
"After 1h40 minutes decided to cancel the order as it was still under preparation. Given that we are talking about fast food (Popeyes) not justified... Even if traffic in the restaurant is high if you predict order will be delayed you need to advise the customer. First experience with Zomato and unfurtunatly for you guys my last also. Customer service was effective in immediately canceling the order and offering a 28 aed coupon, but not even gonna redeem due to the bad first experience.",1
"Options are good, but, Zomato prices are high when compared to the restaurant menu prices (at almost 20% more). Will not use Zomato further because of the extra Zomato charges",1
"So good foods, and also good delivered all the time thanks..",5
It is a very fine app.... But the problem is that they aren't available with the good restaurants. In the start of their business in PTK they showed live tracking but now not,4
Better than any food app. Discount on every order and every single restaurant is available on Zomato. Very user friendly. Above all they always redress your complaint within minutes. Totally satisfied with Zomato..,5
Worst customer service ever. I have been trying to tell my issue and noone is responding or replying to my messages over chat. Never felt so disappointed with any customer service. If there could be rating in minus i would love to give that to your poor customer service,1
Could not log in due to app showing email address already attached and still no otp being received / wrong email address being attached....no other option available to create account....,1
Liked this aap. Especially during the pandemic period when we could not go out. We could easily order food here. I liked this app,4
"Placed an order. Restaurant accepted my order. And after waiting for more than 20 minutes, I got a message that my order was cancelled. Seriously the worst service you can get. Looting people.",1
Of lately Zomato has improved a lot. Service quality and order hasselws have reduced. Sadly I am not taking any membership cause we are all in lockdown!,4
Worst support care and offers. Promo is not working as showing in the app.,1
Placed a veg order but zomato delivered non veg item. My children were waiting for the item but unfortunately very bad experience with zomato. It was my first order and very ashamed. Very disappointed with the service. I would suggest every one not to trust ever on this ridiculous service or app,1
Worse experience with them . received food in 1 hr (they committed 30 min) then food oil spill everywhere in polythene I sended then image . They are not even on chat they keep hold for 30 min not even answering I will complaint oin consumer court,1
Very worst app better to keep quiet and stop doing business very worst support the food will be delivered fast as per their rules but the customer has been waiting for 2 hours no proper response from restaurant as well as support bloody app better to keep bangles instead of selling food,1
"Delivery within optimal time. The food used to be much better from New Kanti Kabab,and needs improvement . 17.07.2019.... no improvement. 14th.Feb,21....much better now.. However New Kathi Kebab does not take orders during the evening",5
It shows the cost *3 from restaurant normal rate and its shows offer which minus *1 or *2 cost but never takes normal price from restaurant For ordering food 0/10 For dining using Pro 8/10,1
It's a really good application.when you will get hungry you just select the item and without any doubt you can order it...and the food will come to your door step without any difficulties. I have been using this application since 3 year and it's really nice application,5
Such a disgusting service there is no one to answer the call or number as well the chat I's useless no rely from customer care The delivery guy tells reason that he is unable to deliver due to personal issue How do things go ahead waste of time waiting for food Giving offers is not a good service delivery as promised is good service,2
"Useless services. Have ruined my every order and every time they apologize instead upgrading themselves with trained staff and better services. I have wasted my energy, time and lot of money on this services. Please do not use this. Better go to restaurant and buy food directly.",1
"My delivery was 30 min late and they requested I wait another 30 min , this is ridiculous, they were not helpful at all, I will not use zomato again , there are other delivery apps available",1
"Worst Service Ever.............The Service tax & Delivery Charges are too High. Like, if you are ordering ₹100 Burger they will make if ₹60 as Service tax & another ₹60 as delivery charge and now you are ordering a tiny little burger for ₹220. What the hell !!!! 🤣🤣",1
Half the time the route selected by zomato is wrong to my home. Unfortunately the route is only displayed after the order and we can't correct that.,1
The new version of app was much better and helpful than the old one. I'm satisfied with the delivery and quality of the food and looking forward for many more such orders to place on zomato,5
Theyvare not responsible for any kind of delays and they are not giving reminders also to the resrauratant in case of delays ....better directly order,1
"Issue is tips given to valets. They work very hard and come to our houses even on bicycles. And we tip them. But greedy Zomato doesn't credit that amount to their account. Moreover, once u tip a valet for his excellent service, Zomato will add the same tip by default to next order if u r not careful enough. But even the second tip given by me didn't reach the valet. Shame on such crony capitalism. Atleast think about your own delivery staff burning in the Sun to make ends meet!",1
Delivery charges are high.. near to that shop also delivery charges is 27 rupees.. not good..and also it takes late delivery..40 minutes before I ordered food.. it takes too much time for delivery.. and also ZOMATO executives assigned 15 mins before for ordered delivery.. sometimes irritated to order..,3
"Very effortless, timely, well informed service",5
App is good. But the company doesnot have control over their services offered to customers when issue arises. Its just another third party consulting services with no control or rights on their services offered.,1
Easy to use....so much options for food choices....,5
"Instead of buying Zomato Pro, they still charge delivery fee. In case of extremely bad quality food which you cannot eat, they return 20% and want you to be happy with it. They have a lot to learn to earn Customer's trust.",1
"I ordered first time on Zomato, I did online payment but not received the food and delivery boy not picking the call 😡, I utterly disappointed with Zomato & will file complain against you",1
"Your app says that a restaurant delivers to my location. 30 mins later, after accepting payment, you call me to say the restaurant does not deliver to my location. This happens 90% of the time.",1
"This app is a lifesaver for a working woman like me who doesn't know very much about cooking..here delivery boys are so trained, professional and ofcourse polite..I used to use another app for food delivery but had to switch to Zomato for different kind of issues...till now I didn't get dissatisfied at all while using this app.",5
"Large network, more options, best deals and fastest delivery. Till the moment this was my experience, what else is expected. Happy with Zomato, keep up the good work.",5
"Service is much better but my suggestion to Zomato, they should add more shops in Narnaul. Now after corona lockdown, only one restaurant provide services in my area. worst experience.",1
"Good in all aspects... Good and professional service by their delivery boys in convinient way. Just good, offer's are at the best.. so big thumbs up, zomato never let down my need when i actually needed most..",5
"Wrongly rated restaurant. Restaurants are must not following preparation guidelines. Cheating to market discount/offer. Review/Rating is not eniugh, there should be some coding of certain popular restaurants, because there is many with same name and same area to confuse customers.",1
Good Experience till date & m happy with your Service.. Tysm for being available during this Pandamic Time..,5
Zomato does not help incase there are issues with food from firms like dominos even after ordering through them. They blatantly deny and we as customers have to run behind dominos for resolution. This is not why we pay premium prices to zomato. Absolutely cheap attitude from zomato.,1
"I made a prepaid order and was waiting for 2 hours after which i got a notification that the order has been cancelled by the restaurant, later on calling the restaurant they said the order has been dispatched and picked by a Zomato vallet, after contacting Zomato they said the valet that picked up the order is not picking up his phone, This has happened for the 2nd time and they offer a condolence in the form of a coupon which seems useless considering the service they provide Deleting the app",1
"Nice app. They need a filter ""non-veg"" the same way they have a filter for ""veg""",4
Ordering food is easy but the pro membership is useless. They add up extra amount in the form of delivery charges and taxes and give those amount as discount.,1
"Zomato DELIVER only APOLOGY and small discount or sometime full amount for missing items after ruining your party and keeping your guests hungry until you arrange food for them from some other restaurant by yourself not by Zomato. They say that our feedback help them to improve service but they refuse to redeliver the items which is a constant feedback from customers. They don't return delivery charges, taxes and packaging charges for those itmes.",1
Too much expensive. Why the hell you are not publishing original restaurant menu price ? Some restaurants higher rated but food quality and taste not at all good. Not deserved for single star.,1
Amazing application loving it delivery are always on time or before time if any chance got the unfresh food which is anyhow not a mistake of delivery person for this zomato always ready to refund back amount ....thanks Zomato,4
Awesome Taste and also delivery was very fast.,5
Good service. When u Hungary open zomato n order it doesn't matter it's day or night.,5
"I've tried to chat with the customer care but they just don't reply after sending ""hi"" and then they won't help you, worst customer care service I've ever seen.",1
The delivery charges has been increased for all hotel even for nearer hotel too which is too bad to choose Zomato. If atleast based on hotel distance delivery charges can be accepted by customer.,1
"Random cancellations seem to be becoming order of the day. Most classic excuse was ""we dont know who was suppsed to deliver your order so please place the order again."" Edit: Great improvement. I am revising the rating from 1 to 5 Star.",5
The promo code are not applicable on combo offer and that's not right and delivery charges are way high then expected.Change the terms and policies as we do buy food over the conditions and then we apply it says it is not valid as it doesn't apply on combo offers that's not fair at all.,3
"Whatever i have ordered i have never got my complete order, always some food item has been missing. Hate zomato. Very bad customer service. They dont rectify ir respond to mails or calls. Never ordering thru this app",1
"If you paid and order doesn't get confirmed from the hotel, then you can not cancel and get the reimbursement. You need to place another order and both the order if came then you have to pay for both",1
"The orders are not delivered properly. You order for example - x and y, but only one out of the two is delivered.",1
This service some time not working properly and some time the offer code not approved by them. Also customer care person are not supportive with the customer they are not able to solve the problem.,1
Zomato is delivering from many restaurants to our area whereas Swiggy is delivering from only one bakery. Well done Zomato and keep it up. Keep expanding your boundaries and keep growing...,5
The tracking timer is fake. Always works as per whims and fancies of the app. Over pricing and fooling the customer is common. Terrible service,1
"Crazy good cocktails, lovely food, and such a fun, friendly vibe-- if I should say so myself lol. Love the energy behind the bar,MUST TRY: Salcette Salsa, Midnight brekkie, Paloma, Mr Spritzer- and if you have a cold, ask for a Hot Toddy. For food, I personally love the pork ribs, the Creamy polenta, the dukshiri seabass, the pasta carbonara , the burger and oh, definitely the fondant cake!",5
"Arey chete, I came here to order my food nor link to PAYTM. I am not understanding why a person can fill all the details first in PAYTM then order. Meanwhile will turn to other option. Change the mind set. You are doing business for you not for PAYTM.",1
"I started hating Zomato customer service, their hospitality is worse , they them self ask us to mail them if you approach them with any complaints or querry and claims to reply with in 48 hrs and doesn't even care your concern even if you mail them",1
Zomato food delivery service is great. But the app interface can be improved. The menu listings show very clumsy. They need redesign.,4
"I love this app cause it is only the app which is giving delivery in my area not like other app which give annoying notification like they are ""not available at Ur place"" thank Zomato for the delivering at my place .😍",4
Terrible service and charging taxes and packing charges over and above what the restaurant is charging. They must make their billing transparent. The customer care is unable to explain why I am paying 624 for a cake which costs 435 inclusive of taxes,1
Due to large number of orders we are accepting only orders above 250. What the heck.cant buy items under 250..........,1
enjoyed a lot...Zomato delivers food in time and the staff is polite and friendly.the offers with pro account is amazing 👏 but zomato should reduce pro membership charges so everyone can enjoy its benefits after all its matter of food and it should be in Approach of everyone!!!,5
"Good Service! Customer support is helpful. Recommend that delivery guys take video while delivering food, so that customer does not try to harass delivery guy.",5
Good quality food & timing of delivery.,4
"Past one month Zomato app does not allow any food review. The moment you start typing, Submit Review button gets deactivated. You can only rate not review. 18 Mar problem still persists even after repeatedly uninstalling & following Zomato Support instructions. Cn only rate, cannot provide a review. Zomato hope you will respond!!!!!",5
Works. But somethimes the experience gets rotten when u wait a lot cuz u know the guy is taking another guys order with urs too and waiting at the restaurant 15 mins longer. So yeah stupid on their part. But yeah it works too.,3
The items shown in the list are not available with the Hotel. It happened three times.Kindly make sure that the list of items are readily available in Hotel at the time of booking.,2
"This app is not worthy. There is no customer service feature, no cod option is available. Improve Cash on delivery system. This app really needs a lot of add ons n improvements. Do work on it n improve all this.",1
Delivery Time changes according to them. 15mins to get your order will be there for 1hr. And if they don't deliver order after one hour they just say sorry and refund your amount. You sit hungry,1
"Terrible Delievery Partners.... Not receiving Calls & shows in app that Order is been delievered.... There is no option of Negative Stars in Play Store, otherwise i would have given literally Negative Review",1
"After the last update, my Zomato has become much slower. I have tried installing it again twice but the problem is same.",2
"Breaked pledge "" ontime or FREE"". I purchased an item and delivery boy didn't came even 100 mtrs. Actually he has to be at 9:29 , but he reached out my location 9:45. When I contacted zomoto service, they told he was there on time. Worst Worst Worst Worst Worst Worst",1
Very awesome but want abit discount in all payments barriers.,5
One of the worst food app I get cold food stuffing was less and agent said we can't refund and agent was rude to me. Everytime I get cold food. Am I fool to have cold food,1
"I opted On Time Or Free Option But Still I am not able to avail Cashback. I Contacted Support Team, they are saying we are not able to do the verification. Please Don't Make Customer Fool 🙏",1
There is no coordination between the application and the restaurants delivering food.. But they just say We are sorry for the inconvenience and back out from the matter They just don't value there customers They don't have time to resolve our issues and they are just busy earning money Selfish people😠😡😠😤🤬,1
"The app is easy to use, comprehensive and transparent. No hidden charges are there. Transactions are processed promptly. Thanks, Zomato.",5
It's has become better in location tracking and delivery procedure,5
Very very disappointing app.they can't refund amount after many request ..they simply asked tomorrow your refund show in your account..after 1.5 month they are not credited...,1
It is amazingly good and convenient. Zomato gold has encouraged us to go to new restaurants. The only drawback is that gold sends as mail 24/7 and it is annoying,3
"Shows discounts applicable on restaurants, but no discounts are applicable. Even pro doesn't work. Chat support so poor, the executes are all dumb and have no knowledge & understanding...",1
Worst service....They show in the app that we will get the free order if they couldn't deliver within 37 mins & my order was late today but still they aren't giving free order. They are just fooling the customers.,1
App is totally fine but the charge is really high. Day by day its increasing really bad so nowadays even though I go through menus seeing the total amount I would think otherwise,2
Pathetic service. They can't have call or live chat option for issues with food delivered. They have automated chat service. How to reply on such services? Thanks anyways.,1
"Should have the refund option as the app sometime is unable to track the exact location, and many times it has happened that my order got cancelled.",1
Everything is good but the chats with executive needs to be improved ( when there is some issues with food or receive Less item that communication needs improvement thanks) 😊,4
"Surge fee, high demand fee, weather surge, fake taxes, 20 - 24% commission charges after eating all this they are not even ready to deliver a good service. Pathetic!! Restaurants should start their own delivery apps. These apps are looting the customers as well as the restaurants.",1
Zomato charging distance fee now plus delivery fee. Not acceptable at all. What is this distance fee?,3
"I have registered for first time and they give 50% off with free delivery , after i place ordered i get a call that resturant not accepting a order and they cancelled it . So that offer is invalid for next order",1
"It is very difficult to cancel your order. Through on line chat, they will tell only 3 minutes but nothing will be fone even they do not come back online also during chat",1
"Zomato is good then other online food delivery companies, but i find it frustrating when the order is incomplete. The delivery personel should check the order before he pick it up",4
Very bad customer support. If items are missing in order then they don't deliver again and also not returning full amount. Really disappointed with Zomato.,1
Too much bad experience today.. I ordered nd pay by online... They are delivered my order another place... Delivery boy calling me he said my no is not recheble.. He drop my parcel this location front of one house main close gate..(no hand to hand)only close main gate..And he leave this place drop my order in close main gate.. They didnot delivered my food nd they didinot refund my paid money.. I really very upset about it...plese dont pay money before received your order i recommended everyone.,1
Great app Connecting small businesses wirh customers. Excellent for foodies.,5
Very good offers & discounts when compared to other food delivery sites. Delivery time takes little bit longer than the promised time. Overall nice experience.,4
"Customers care service is most worst, they not provide customer care number when email on that they said i will call you but not calling ..most bad experience ...",1
your service was good but unfortunately the cake was undercooked and we couldn't enjoy our cake,5
"Service is never on time by Zomato. Food is prepared and handed over to riders but riders wait for more deliveries to come for the same area where they are delivering and then deliver in bulk to maximize on their commission while the food gets cold. Delivery riders are untrained, rude and equally unprofessional. Highly unapologetic and unprofessional organization.",1
"Zomato is using unfair means to promote Pro. My wife has Zomato Pro and I don't. Many times when I order food for delivery, Zomato shows that there is a 30% off for pro users for that restaurant. When I check the same restaurant on my wife's mobile, there is no discount available. This has happened multiple times and not just once. So basically Zomato makes users feel that they are missing out on discounts because they don't have pro, but the same discounts aren't available to pro users either.",2
"In the starting, it was just an app to try new dishes but now it's my sathi for anytime anywhere anything food.",5
"Always wonderful, I had tried other apps earlier, but this one is the great. No confusion while delivery with minimum calling.",5
Very much affordable and helpful to their customers.,5
"very poor chat support. If you need any help, after wasting time on chat support expaling issue they will ask to send email. Total waste of time.",1
I have ordered 5 shawarma but I have received only 4 due fasting time I didn't check while going to break my fasting I have noticed,1
High Delivery Charge not affordable for a normal person !,1
The app crashed a few times after the latest update,4
What's the problem with this app. I had updated it multiple times still its not opening. Neither its sending the error report. I am losing my temper and you are losing your customer. Bye bye zomato.,1
Iam very happy with zomato app they are doing very fast and they always giveing discount,5
"they suggest shopkeeper to increase tye item rates and do not take responsibility for the quality of food,if anything goes wrong then there is no customer care to speak,they have preconfigured sms system and you have the the only choice to choose that options.",2
Very fast delivery good understanding of delivery boy.,5
"The service is very poor, they are giving time of 30 min and deliver order in 55 min and more, they preserise zomoto delivery boys to deliver multipul delivery in one time . Very pathetic and have no value of time of client.",1
"Well, my overall experience with Zomato is amazing and i usually order food from here only whenever i am hungry or want to enjoy something different, delivery is fast, and most pf the restaurant serve delicious food, go for it guys.❤️",5
"Very bad, I haven't received my order and they have charged for it, after submitting the query they are saying that they delivered the order. Wow 😳",1
The worst experience of my life it took 90 minutes for delivering an order and before its showing 40 min for delivery time,1
"Having issues in catching accurate GPS location of delivery address. Try to fix it, causes contentions with the delivery-person every time.",3
Great experience with zomato. If you want food in your hands you have to pay a little bit more.they fullfill their promises. And most importantly their customers support is best among all.,5
Not showing location properly and service is too bad,1
"The app doesn't provide the option of refund, and the delivery partners are very rude and impolite and do not deliver the complete order at times. Overall the customer service is very bad",1
Single order placed with ku kuch koo..twice payment declined while paying by UPI my account got debited. So paid third time by debit card. All three orders got delivered ! How? I am aghast. Only one order was seen in order delivery tracking. extremely unhappy. I hope the refund gets credited,2
no doubt about zomato. definitely a good app to order food at anytime. but these days i am disappointed with it. i saw my NOCOOKING offers in the morning and then suddenly they were not available anymore. i hate it. i wanty offers back! zomato are you reading this? if you are then give me my offers back!,4
Everytime I order from Zomato never get it on time and always there a problem like delay or cold food and today my order went to different location so far it's been 1:30 min waiting for my order.,1
Thank you zamato u take order earlie mornig and delivery at times . Best of luck to Zomato team .,5
"All ok, But when it comes to delivery surge I get a chance to check other food delivery apps. That's when don't recommend Zomato. Remove delivery surge(recommended)",4
"In my account, prices for each of the item was showing INR 3 to 5 higher and delivery charge by INR 20 higher than my colleague, where both the mobiles were kept pointing to same location coordinates in the map. My friend has already deleted the Zomato account and I am too planning for the same.",2
Though they give deliveries. We cannot order from multiple restaurants. Also the discount that they give is covered in their delivery charges. Which I feel is a sort of deceit and cheating. The restaurant gives discounts and zomato takes it away and also charges us for delivery. VERY SAD AND BAD PRACTICE!!!,1
"Prompt delivery , delivery boy followed Covid guidelines, well behaved.",5
Ratings are available along the menu ..this new update is so fantastic...I would personally appreciate the person whosoever had done this had done great job and should be rewarded,5
Zomato is a wonderful experience. The service is amazing. Even the return policy and refund system is good. It feels as if they genuinely want to create happy food memories for the customers . Even the pro discounts serve as an added bonus to order from Zomato and not others. Payments are hassle free and so is the UI... All in all a great app for ordering good tasty and value for money food.,5
It was good . The food has arrived at time and the main thing is the Zomato app is carefully following the rules of social distance and wearing mask,5
"Quite essential nowadays,also user friendly app (easy to use)",5
Nice go to app when you are hungry. Almost has all the local outlets in one app which makes it versatile for you to choose depending upon your choice.,4
"I mainly appreciate the zomato valet. They are real superheros, because they even deliver food to us during the pandemic, risking their lives and health they bring food to us to keep us safe from the virus. God bless them all. Zomato is a great app! Keep up the good work!",5
"I have ordered my first order now & it still showing ""preparing"" after 45min of placing order😏",1
"one of waste service in the world i have ever seen.If they dont accpet this words then kindly reply to me and help me to get solve my problem. I made a call to the tollfree number which they have provided there is no response from them. waste service do not download the app it is better to skip this app and there waste service.even the different prices for different customers,this is totally bad.i have kept this message after reaching ur customer care.",1
Everytime there is an item missing from the order. Giving a refund is good but what's the use if we wanted the food and didn't get what we ordered for.,1
"It s been a Great experience with Zomato. Only problem is that Zomato tied with some of roadside restaurants who provides Unhealthy food (Powai) . Its just a feedback. Till now everything is going well. Thanks for the service Zomato. Only one favour I want is - Monthly /Quaterly No delivery fee packages as Swiggy does. Edit: Nope, we don't require such Swiggy Supr kind thing, so costly.",5
I've tried emailing zomato for help on my card not going through for a few days with no response. It keeps saying network error. The app never said that before and always accepted my card. Nobody from zomato has bothered replying back,1
Worst customer service ever. They have introduced new feature something like 30 min delivery or free. When they see that th order will not make it on time they cancel the order..,1
Without bill and address of selected hotel/Restaurant I think It will be a footpath meal,1
Very good service from zomato👍... We are satisfied😃Thank you zomato.. In this covid pandemic we got our order very safely😇😊👍,5
Poor app. Poor interface. Ridiculous complaint redressal mechanism. Atcuall a FRAUD to be precise. No one can beat it for sure.,1
All the prices online are different than actual restaurant prices. This gives a wrong impression to a customer and is so wrong. I hope this food delivery app actually give some discoynts rather than these dirty tactics,3
lovely experience.. thats the way to go. i wish zomato a very best wishes for their future Plans and Growth ! and best compliments..,5
The timing is Zomato is conveniently slower than the normal clock. I obviously don't mind the wait. But deceiving is so not done.,2
Certainly bad in resolving an issue. Restaurent was kind enough to solve the issue from their side but the Zomato support chat service was pathetic. Thankyou.,3
"Zomato is fake ,order is not placing for cash on delivery .payment is deducted but then order is cancel so payment is not credited 😡😡😡😡",1
Good service providers. Timely food get from desired restarunts to our place. I feel good since delivery charges are also minimal,5
Zomato delivers is very responsible because they always come in time and easy to order,5
"They are going for an IPO but the business at the ground level is being run in a pathetic manner. Have had multiple issues with orders having items missing, packaging leaking or spilled. The Pro membership is useless as the worst restaurants are part of this plan and you get really bad good when you order from them. Also Pro for in person dining is another pain - most restaurants try to make it extremely difficult to get any benefits. Plus most food listed is overpriced by 30%.",1
The system assigns multiple orders to the rider and order is delayed. The customer is even charged a distance fee. The system slyly increases the delivery ETA. Deceitful and unethical.,1
"They are just confirming the order, After sometime they are cancelling the order, And just stealing our money and they are not even responding to our mails.Worst experience ever with zomato.I majorly suggest any food delivery app other than zomato.",1
Super app to order food and you Good offer as well,4
Very fast and easy delivery.. We got within 20 minutes,5
Worst food delivery app I've ever used. And one more thing! This is the right place to do injustice with there delivery boys And in return! They gave you free food because of their ego and thousands of followers in social media with no self respect and help you to get famous in such less time. At last SHAME ON YOU ZOMATO 🖕🏻,1
"Had a poor experience today with the valet. While the food was ready about 40 minutes back, but there was no auto reassignment of rider/ valet, unless the customer coordinates with all concerned and raises a complaint.",3
Very fast service and very eassy system for order,5
Very good app. At midnight we dont know which hotel is open. But with zomato we guys have the food at our doorstep. Love 💘 this app. Also. We track the order that where it is. Also both the contact they provided us..,5
"Zomato doesn't value it's own offers. I opted for 'late or free' and when the order came late, support said that 60 seconds delay is not covered. You customer support lost my respect.",1
"No filter for Bacon/Beef/Buffalo meat, Please add a filter so people can avoid places that prepare the meat choices mentioned above. This is an extremely polar issue, which can cause unwanted situation for Zomato and the servers.",1
"Utterly pointless. What's the point of advertising loads of restaurants and cafes that don't deliver, that don't show their menu, or both. Back to Talabat then.....",2
Prices on menu items are bloated by 30-50% and discount is offered on top of it to hide such practices. I am not at all happy about this.,1
Easy accessible and very convenient app.,4
"App is picking wrong delivery location, causing lot of trouble.Map showing delivery of order is also wrong and not properly updated.",1
Application is difficult to use. Changes don't come into effect immediately and cause difficulty for both the customer and delivery personnel.,2
I am giving it one star because your app changes the option in just a second I doesn't use Paytm I got an deal a thing is lesser than his value and i am also getting it in home delivery but after I again open the app it showed me that you have to pay it from Paytm,1
I have given 1 star bcoz 0 star rating is not possible. I hv ordered 2 hours back from thrive restaurant in parliament road in Delhi. And tey have not delivered it yet. My kid is very hungry since it is 3.30 pm olredy. I have paid online. Tey are showing tat da order is out for delivery since 1 hour. And the restaurant does not pick up any calls. This is not expected and very bad.,1
Service is good but restaurants sended food different from order. So pls resolve this one only. Otherwise overall good performance. Restaurants take care for orders.,5
Just taxes are a bit too high My only baf review is that why does the map shrinks back after I am done looking at it,4
Need a smooth and tasty burger? Just for it! Cool and comfort place to hangout and reasonable rates with awesome taste. Very good place to hangout with friends and family. Nice ambience. 10/10 recommended.,5
"Zomato is the worst app ,a lot of time they send the stale and uncooked and also don't pack food properly and we lost our money which is earned by hardwork...... Infact swiggi is better than zomato..... Also very very very very late delivery so the food become cool and tight so we can't chew them....... In my opinion we should ban zomato....",1
"My experience with Zomato is good .. how they are connecting the restaurants and manage the settlement, riders and backend operations. There Zomato pro service is also a good addition and I wish if they can add home kitchens as well.",4
App is good although a very very bad thing is that u cant cancel orders that are placed by mistake,5
Poor service.. not making sure rider delivery on time.. giving false reason for delay,1
"Extend your reach. Just don't limit us to surrounding areas. Most of the real good restaurants do not exist in our areas. Deliver longer distance. Charge for it. Say for example, open BKC restaurants for me. Will willingly pay extra delivery charges. You can put a time barrier. That's acceptable too.",5
I was having an average experience but once you guys promised me the refund for an order that was waste but I haven't received it till yet. I don't know what is taking it this long. Going to uninstall this app soon.,2
Zomato day by day is becoming third class. In my last order all items were not given. But instead of taking my complaint they moved me to automated chat. Above is my earlier review However with my recent experience with Zomato is good.,5
Very bad experience after 12 not showing delivery unable to delivery for current location Very bad experience,1
No customer support ..orders are always late but customer have to pay cancellation charges. Useless service . Swiggy is far better anf their customer care is always reachable. Won't recommend Zomato,1
Very user friendly app. And saves lot of money...,5
Taking delivery charges plus charging delivery surge Rs 40. Swiggy has better prices and offers.,1
"The price of the items in the menu are more when compared to the price in restaurants. Also the taxes, delivery charges are way too much",3
"The food was not on time but still they show the food was on time. When I try to chat, it showed error.",1
"The customer support has been worst ever. Spoke to 3 to 4 executives regarding a refund which has not been processed. None of them were able to resolve instead demands the customer to wait for few more days. How dare Zomato is holding up customer money? Waste service. Zomato, you have already one customer by me and so going lose many in coming days.",1
So many reasons and there is no customer service to complain. They will answer only through chat. Going to uninstall.,1
It's an amazing app.. Literally the Reastraunrants I love and I can't go there on daily basis as such I live in quite mountain place. This app sorts out all the issues. Thank you so much.,4
Very worst experience with these app. Never ever open... every time having some issues,1
"Appreciation for the delightful meals and thanks for connecting me to my nearby restaurants. Apart from this, I can actually get the detailed menu of other well known restaurants around my city. Enjoying it.",5
It is nice app you can do you food blogging with Zomato. the DISCOUNTS & offers are helpfull. Also the review help you save money instead of wasting them at wrong places. have a great time & yummy meals with Zomato.,5
They cancelled my order. Didn't even inform me. Kept waiting for 90 minutes. And then they said you hav given wrong address while address is auto selected from last address.,1
I am dam Happy with Zomato experience at my 1st order itself . Zomato is really a worth service with full social distance and fear free from covid affection.,5
"I ordered my food with the zomota and within 2 minutes I opted for ""cancel my order"" option because I forgot to apply 50% off promo code. I requested for cancellation of my order, so that I can again reorder and apply the promo code but the Zomato messaging assistant said my order already got ready in those 2 minutes in which I tried to cancel it, how come this is possible. I had a pathetic experience with Zomato, never going to order in future from this application.☹️",1
"There are manupulating the actual rates, as per my observation there is 5 to 10% extra in the zomato menu Giving 3 stars only for fastest delivery and user freindly application. Other wise i could have give 1 star",3
the problem is live tracking is not good . and choicee for restaurants are less. and drivers dont follow the map most of the time.but customer service and offers are amazing.,5
Wish could give even less ratings. They charge more for everything and pretend to give discounts. Moreover not one resturant listed in here has their entire menu.,1
Very gud app great experience delivery is super fast nd delivery person of Zomato is too good nd helpful,5
Don't accept orders if you people don't have delivery partners there is no point of the app if you people cannot deliver the order. Giving discount coupons can not satisfy the hunger of a person.,1
"Delivery wise it's very good one, but delivery charges are increasing too much of 67 rs. The quantity I ordered rs of 270rs. But delivery charges are increasing Zomato which bis too high.",2
Very bad I ordered and when I open the package the smell was very bad and I called the restaurant but they are neglected,2
I am using this app literally everyday and am happy with there delivery services. As there delivery guys are Professionals and have good ettiquetes. That's why I always choose Zomato on above of any other food App.,4
Very bad - on sunday evening one orders food for family and the riders doesn't pickup food. One cannot even cancel as ite non refundable on sunday. Nor zamato nor the rider picks up the call. Avoid zamato Worst experience.,1
"Never had an app be harder to search in. ""Breakfast"" brings up two results. Other searches load cafes from across the other side of Melbourne, like an hour away.",1
Very worst customer service no proper response at all been waiting for all most 30mins.,1
"It's been more than hour since we ordered ,seems zomato ppl aren't bothered...kids and parents have slept waiting for food and zomato isn't bothered as they say contact restaurant directly and the restaurant isn't picking up the phone. Why should we order from zomato if they don't want to own up...Be responsible guys...we have paid you so own up to it or refund my money",1
"Staying away from family, outside, alone this app helped me to deliver food from renowned restaurants to them so they can enjoy a bit. Also, when I am too tired to cook or craving for a particular delicious meal, Zomato is there.",5
Sometime the delivery is good. But faced issues many time. Shows 30min while ordering and after order shows 45min. Can't afford such delays..,1
The delivery time was showing 45min and when the order is placed the delivery time changed to 79min which is unacceptable. I have experienced delays from zomato many times.,1
Simply superb...we can easily order the food in this app,5
Overall experience is Good but if you give more discounts that will be more good & it will boost me more to order more ❤️ and do something about delivery charges Because sometime a person just want to eat one or things and it'll cost more than just. Thanks,4
Good restaurants always shows as unavailable. Even I talk to restaurants owner they said it's zomato issue. They keep only those restaurants active who took paid promotion.,1
Ordered for a bday and at 12.30 at night after many calls got to know that the order was cancelled and the delivery boy switched off his mobile. For delivery order of Rs305 was initiated refund of 287. That too after asking. Too bad. Swiggy better.. Any problem the response and customer refund is done in a way they intiate a bigger refund to make up for their goof up. Hoping for a better response frm Zomato in regards to compensating in terms of refund considering our big embarrassmnt on bday.,1
Very helpful for me in emergency time but I think delivery charge is little high,5
They suggested nearest burger King store which is 9 kms away from my place. It took 1 and half hour 2 delivered the order which can be done within 30 minutes. There app system is pathetic,1
"Your discounts are useless; your app is error-prone, your time assessments are incorrect, and your tracking is very poor. Your membership canvassing was a fake.",2
Good experience so far. Zoomato is very customer centric.,5
"1st time i am going to order. So after delivery, i post realy review. Food option and Restorant avalibility is good.",4
"Well designed and developed application, appreciate the customer experience, the service it renders to the society",4
It's like a great app for me It's better than other of these types The only problem is sometimes when we order the food and did not receive it and complain to Zomatothen they tell that the food will be delivered in 10 to 15 minutes after the the food does not get delivered to a home when we came to know that the food order has been cancelled,4
"There were items missing in my order, tried everything but got no help from the team, all I got is apologies and an empty belly even after paying for it.",1
Very good app when food is in bad quality we will get refund also over all I like Zomato,5
"The offers provided by Zomato is much more lucrative than those offered by Swiggy..Uber Eats was the most economical or cost-effevtive food delivery app and I regularly used it for getting my food delivered but after it got shut down or probably merged itslf with another Food delivery app, I have swtched over to Zomato for their lucrative offers and compared to Swiggy, u can save more money using Zomato than Swiggy for the same dish ordered from the same restaurant!",4
Zomato mapping service is not good and I don't know how they are merging the address with the location due to this delivery boy are suffering very badly because of tomato mapping the delivery guy taken 1hr 40 min and km 12,1
Waiting since 1.5hours for delivery. The delivery boy is out for delivering 4 other orders at a time. For me its showing 9mins since an hour. No value for customer's time.,1
it would be better if the gps locator is more accurate. I m disappointed in how your customer service is now days on top of that you treat your employees such way.,1
There is always an extremly delay in the delivery of the order,1
"The delivery is always late. And they are not willing to improve the services. The quality of food is deteriorating everyday. Even receiving wrong items very frequently. Informed Zomato team many times. Instead of new fake promises, nothing is inmproving. Do not order from them.",1
"Superb app ,, but offering lesser discounts, now a days",5
Very bad experience. They are charging full delivery charges but detailing 1 delivery boy for 3 orders . This leads to extreme delay in delivery and cold food . And then no one of their representatives even help,1
Worst experience with zomato Completely embarassed having this app installed And ordered food I will be escalating this in all social media today I escalated an issue about 1 hour ago still on chat still being transferred agent to agent I know they are playing around Now the chat has been disconnected I never had such an embarrassment in my life Where a delivery boy coming and shouting at me as he is not able to find my location Such an incompetent worke You guys will hear from consumer court,1
The worst customer service and functional of app. I provided all the proofsbof an order yet the idiotic agent named SOPHIA keep giving canned response instaed of taking any action. Worst service by the agent n worst process of app which even after selection of order gave wrong orderorder. NEVER PLACE ANY ORDER FROM THE APP. SPECIALLY PRE PAID ORDERS,1
Very Friendly and quick service.,5
"I'm uninstalling Zomato app today because they said they won't take responsibility on the orders quality. I used to order because they had this good customer service and valued their customers money. But as of now, if they aren't taking responsibility and started giving such customers service and doesn't value our money then theirs no uniqueness in Zomato and any other food delivering company. People please don't take risk and order from Zomato coz they ain't gonna take responsibility.",1
Ordered Pizza from Mojjo Pizza and food was ordered around 6:15pm and didn't arrive in the next 2 and half hours. Order status has been updated to delivered upon contacting support without delivering. This is a horrible experience. You kept us starving. Please think twice before ordering from Zomato.,2
Please do not use this app and it's service during these COVID times. They have tie up with all cheap restaurants and both Zomato and these restaurants are operating for just money. They are providing stale food which is all smelly and not consumable at all. Happened with me twice. Going to uninstall it and cannot trust them with COVID going and so many people suffering.,1
recently the app fails to show the list of hotels.so i am not able to order anything.route map is always wrong and so delivery boys are complaining.there will be no action from the authorities.,2
UI can be Improved like a lot. Edited Post: Nice UI,5
It's a really good app for booking a table or ordering food online. But I feel online orders from same restaurant are costly compare to swiggy at times.,4
Unable to submit the valet rating. Done option disappeared.,3
"The promocode starts showing invalid whenever you try to apply them, and the resteraunts that earlier shows no minimum order start showing this mich minimum order is required once you try to order from them.",1
"I didn't got my money back , after cancellation of the order( twice ) even though Zomato said that they have reverted the money. Otherwise it has been a good experience.",4
"Worst app ever! Zomato is running a fraud. They double bill you for orders and when confronted, all they do is make excuses! It's been 2 months and I've contacted them 8 times, and they say that ""you'll receive refund by today"". These people don't even have the guts to say the truth, that they will be fooling their customers and are never gonna repay the money.",1
"Prompt service, good offers just needs to work lil bit on delivery person rest all good",5
It would be nice if you add the feature to automatically turn off location services as soon as I terminate the app. Till then I'm keeping you on 4⭐,4
"Best delivery app but sometimes some hotels don't deliver upto the mark Zomato should try to avoid orders to such hotels based on reviews , all the delivery executives are well dressed, mannered and are polite so amazing work Zomato , keep on doing this great work",5
"Few items missing in order. Further, no no. To raise complaint and no option for delivery of the missing item.",2
The worst App I ever seen. They tend to cancel the orders and don't refund at all. In addition to that the worst experience you will see to the customer support...,1
I have ordered the food through this app but the hotel / rider didn't delivered complete order / food at the time of delivery. I have already wrote order@zomato but not satisfactory reply not yet received. Please contact on my mob number 97292 42858.,1
"Zomato has become horrible, placing order takes more than 15 mins, promo codes don't work, the hotel's don't read instructions, the delivery guys don't deliver on time, the love location doesn't work. I will never use Zomato again.",1
"Food was not delivered, but status is showing delivered. Delivery person was very very rude... Fake deliveries is the big issue",1
I love the app. Just few more options in my area would be wonderful.,4
Unable to track the order at the time delivery since last month. It will be better for customers if issue get rectified at earliest.,1
Best in service but price comparison with hotel menu is high,4
Worst service!!! There is a delay in receiving order.zomato customer support doesn't response to my queries,1
"Bad experience. Order placed on zomato yet no zomato driver/tracking- restaurant driver, no tracking and upon chatting with zomato customer service that food dint arrive until 2 hrs and customer service chat just ends the chat in between chat",1
Recently i ordered on zomato but i have issue realted packing and spillage im trying to contact zomato but since 3 days they are showing high querries even i sent mail but no reply there also.. shared pic on mail. Pathetic customer support .. ticket ID is 7355489.,1
"Really very worst selection of restaurants, I think road side restaurants quality are much better from ur company selected restaurants .yesterday I ordered 1 pannier butter masala and 1 nos chana masala.. and I received 2 pannier masala. They don't check before delivery to customer..just think what kind of quality they maintained. Restaurant name was Bra panjanbi restaurant. Today also I ordered from Agarwal food something was restaurant name..realy the quality of rice and taste was useless.",1
"I think @zomato is doing a great job in providing timely food delivery. Though their brand is being tainted unnecessarily , I'm fully satisfied with their services and timely delivery always. Keep it up guys.",5
"Good app, but not all menue options are shown form the restaurant, if you call the restaurant you can get better cooking options.",4
"Pathetic service, no update on food order, no co-ordination with the restaurant representative, zomato delivery person does not even care to call back, wrong updates on tracking.......",1
Wonderful app and service. And being a Pro member got discounts that paid back my membership cost. All of the reputable restaurants as well as new ones available.,5
Customer support is great also member restraunts are good.,5
It's a perfect app for ordering food . But I guess there shud be more discount coupon availability. And they shud inform once the order is been picked by the boy.,5
"Service ,courtesy, time and hygiene are to be appreciated.",5
"Didn't get cod option all time, always show cod not available,also cant login with my number,it show login not available for this number😂switch to swiggy for better deal,terrible experience with login to zomato",1
I am totally unsatisfied with the food orders in this app nd the food quality is to worest... They didn't get the proper response from the support executive. Totally regread with customers,1
Very bad experience.. I have ordered.. not delieverd .. I have waited for more than 1 hour.. no response ..there is no costumer care number..restaurant phone is out of reach.. zomato refusing for refund,1
Worst delivery app...... delivery timing is worst ....in real 4mins are already gone still time is not decreasing from the estimated delivery time....,1
This app become so much bad. They start charging extra amount on every dishes and very high delivery charge on every order. Very poor from zomato.,1
2 hrs minimum delivery time for even nearby orders these days! Very high delivery charge and restaurant charges! Customer service people can't hear you properly!,1
"The best go to app for the food and dining experience, their service and response to the querry is what makes them likeable..",5
My experience here is very bad. Its service is very bad. it's waiting too much. One day i could not give the order. And next day i ordered one plate moton biriyani 1 piece fry chicken chap at asirbad biriyani price 230/-. After order it's cancel by mistakely of tuch my hand. They did not give me food and returned the money. 😡😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬,1
"Zomato Is nothing but a Fraud!! I'm a pro user and Im paying more for the the Menu and Delivery charge. Zomato's pro is nothing but a marketing gimmick. If they will notice that you are using pro benefits or coupons more or daily, they will simply hike the price of the food items. I'm being charged more than 50% extra than regular delivery fee and price on my Menu is more than regual price and what's cherry on the cake is they have disabled coupons on most of the outlets and so I can't apply.",1
"Zomato delivery executives are nice but the one's sitting in AC rooms and attending to ur problems faced are useless. They don't care understanding ur problem and simply would give reasons from another world and ""VOILA!"" u have successfully wasted money and time by using so called food delivering app. Rest u all u r grown up. If u don't trust me, then go ahead and install and within 3 months come here and write like me. Good Luck ppl.",1
"The food served was amazing, the ambiance was mind-blowing cheaper rate the taste of the food was delicious the location was excellent. Indeed me and my friends had an amazing day.",5
Easy to use. Service is fast and best.,5
"Feedback on Minimum order requirement of 225 on weekends Zomato recently started new policy (loot) of Minimum order requirement of Rs 225 during weekends when their demand is high. This is completely unacceptable. This policy also applicable to Zomato pro customer which saddens me a lot. I have paid hefty amount as annual subscription being a pro customer and still you guys are putting up min order amount and delivery surge fee etc.. So, I wanted to say Good bye to Zomato.",1
"Customer support is very bad. No help could be expected if the order is soiled, spiller or even if you find a dead rat in the food. Disappointing.",1
Very POOR service.. Always late running. PROMO CODE Problem.,1
Very good app for doing ease of food shopping and safe,5
"I tried this place so i ordered tacos flakes mini pops and potato cheese balls , they are amazing so delicious tempting and enjoyable. I am obsessed with the potato balls they are incredible and the tacos too. So i recommend everyone to try this enticing place and as for the price they are affordable.",5
very nice aap I like it fastest delivery in 27 min download this aap 🚀🚀fast delivery only in zomato 🚀🚀 👉zomato👈👍👍,5
Zomato has become too costly. First they increase the rates by 100% and then give a discount of 40%. Seems now they have learnt how to cheat people.,1
Its nice...but it doesn't have option to pay cash on delivery after oder 350 rupees,4
Adding multiple deliveries on the way makes our food very cold and pathetic to eat..causing too much delay,1
"Not able to open the app after downloading, not sure what the problem is, this has been happening every time I download this app",1
Feedback! Why is it so hard to remove delivery option from the cart. I don't want delivery and still end up paying.,1
Very disappointing services. Canceling order at last moment but it showing order delivered. So whats the meaning to get refund if service not on time.,1
This app is not delivering in village. I want to mark 0 star but no 0 star option,1
Don't want to blame delivery boy but commitment of 25 min was a joke. It took 42 min and restaurant is less than 2kms.,3
It seems zomato cheating with their offers. Getting qty delivered very less compared to the amount charged. Really need to quit zomato. Hopefully will be my last order,1
UX is not at all user-friendly. Not convenient to go to the tracking page. Too much focus on reviews which is annoying,1
It is good ..but charges too much delivery fee ..this is the reason for which i hate it I dont like this app at all..so its a request to zomato pls find a solution for this ...,1
this one has corrupt staff. they took the money for pizza and gave me a completely wrong order. there was no cheese in the cheese burst. they are saving ingredients for personal use.,1
"I love this app but I have a problem that if I ordered something the person who brings the order always ask mam ""where is your home""and sometimes they goes to different place and we have to tell them😔🙁",5
"Waste service. They (executive) say sorry and informs as this never happen again. But it happens everytime. But, I receive refund amount.",1
"Great deal 60 % off It cost only 60 Rs 7"" Pizza with great test",5
"Seems like there's bug in latest update. Things are not updating on time like order acceptance, valet details, order on the way.",2
"I am not interested in your pro membership and you have made it compulsory, i am not able to view the menu and place the order because of it. I will delete your app and place the order from other platform.",1
Zomato is very good but sometimes the order will be late they may have some difficult issues but sometimes the order may be important for the recieving person so take care of it,4
Nice fast delivery in 20 mins it's very super food and app zomato it's nice app thank you zomato,5
"Your agent saying he was calling me from one hour where I didn't received any call, but your agent was rude enough and showing his attitude. Worst app and worst service.",1
Worthless app worthless chat services. They make sure you can't correct the problems you have with your orders. It takes a life time till then the food is cold,1
Worst customer support on their issues reported to Zomato. They don't even care for their customers issues. I have reported missing items issue for my today's order they didn't helped me for refund or compansations. They didn't even reply back to their customers. Very much disappointment with Zomato. Customer dissatisfaction with Zomato.,1
"Worst app, always shows high demand and it adds extra charges. I Didn't expect this from Zomato. At first it is very friendly to use but now it becomes horrible.",2
Wonderful.. Easy to use and navigate. Offers are great and very clear. A big thumbs up!!,5
I wish I could find the zeros star button . Worst experience. My COD still not been enabled even after doing more than enough online transaction. Please close you app . Delete it from the app store.,1
"Good app... Customer service is good.. but taxes and delivery charges are a bit high... Else, it's really a good app.",5
They mix up order and keep us waiting. Pathetic service. It took 90 minutes to deliver when it showed 30 minutes at time of delivery.,1
"Very good app, very useful for the current situation.",5
They tell the item will be delivered in 30 mins but actually it was an hour till the oder came and there was no free food given just ols help me out with this complaint.,3
All the orders getting delayed and always i have a very bad experience even with chat team . No support and no one know how to treat customers!!!!! Really disappointed,1
Very good and given best and affordable offers,5
"The taxes and delivery charges are high., apart from the food bills of restaurants. If possible, kindly make changes. Thankyou.",2
Always better and ahead of its competitors. Wide range of foods brought to us handy from multiple outlets is an awesome job. Kudos to Zomato and its team....,5
"Finally 6 to 7 years old relationships with zomato going to be end, only because of change in their customer service policy. Zomato now doesn't care about their customers and the quality of food supplied by there listed restaurants. Zomato does not hold any responsibility of food being delivered by there listed restaurants. So i m leaving this because there are plenty of service providers who do care to there customers way much better then zomato. Thank you zomato for your unacceptable services",1
Zomato is the best food delivery service . I have not experienced any sort of issues till date .,5
Zomato increase the menu prices by choice and on top of that add packaging charge tax and delivery additionally. Absolutely bad service assign double pickup by wallet and delivery time is awfully.,1
Wrost app ever in 2021 the search menu is tottaly wrost every order is delayed 45 mins better we go the hotel instead of waiting for 45 mins in hungry no responces from the delivery person and rude behaviour they take the extra money for the reson of no change....totally wrost...dont even try to order on this app....,1
Very bad experience for me. Couldn't location feed in the app I live in city and main area but he can't receive our location l am going 1 star Worst experience for me,1
I have stopped ordering from Zomato as the delivery charges and taxes are high than the dish prices.,1
Worst experience second time... different valet are assigned...no food is delivered and still shows delivery successful...valet doesn't answer calls..have too many numbers to connect..worst service...never expected this from Zomato,1
Awesome app with many offers ... simple to use ...I really love ve this app,5
"Worst customer service ever. Ordered a cake for baby, it weighed low, chatted with support, kept me on hold and after an hour disconnected the chat. Spoiled our celebration",1
Don't go with online payment with this app. It deducts the amount first and then says online order is not possible for this restaurant and don't even refund us back. Worst experience,1
"Phenomenal food at discounted price...Some times restaurant owners do wrong packaging,, Zomato needs to take responsibility for check atleast once... otherwise great service by Zomato..1star deduction for this",4
"Pretty simple to use, step by step update. Good app",4
The worst app ever.. customer service sucks. They will not respond if food is delivered Cold.. will just ask you to wait.. not recommended to download.. uninstalling immediately,1
"I didnt get my order more than two hours as per assured delivery time . after 2 hours that status for my order is changed from ""your order is on they "" to ""your order has been delivered"" How can they confirm the correct customer ? I dont know its a mistake or like cheating? Be aware of online order This is my first time Thats too very worst experience",1
They charge extra money. Plus do not resolve any issues . Once money gone is gone. Will never recommend anyone to order food from here.,1
"Just awesome, delivery was quiet delayed but that doesnt matter. I dont want that delivery boy takes any risk on road to provide me early.",5
Made a biggest mistake . The Bot (auto help desk)didnt reply with in 2.minutes and my money gone..be carefull when before you make payments.and help.desk jusy waste they will jusy copy paste the same things .worst expereince,1
Very poor delivery service. Riders change directions at their own will and cause delays without any updates on the app.,1
Nice app.... Timely delivery.. Good choices of restaurants,5
"It always says delivery on time or free on burger king orders,but when I said that to customer care they said they don't know anything about it,very rude and unprofessional cheating behaviour,never ordering again,much better option swiggy",1
"Do not pay online. They have no proper customer support, if some issues arise with order. No money is refunded even if order is not delivered. You take a chance with Zomato. If you received your order - you win else Zomato wins - you loose.",1
The worst people in doing business. Don't know how to manage in time deliveries. There is no option to give '0' stars. Even the delivery boys also talk very rude and say cancel the order and disconnect the call. They do deliver 2 to 4 orders at a time and the time you get your food it will be cold and thick shakes will be liquid.,1
I love zomato a lot. Usually has more discounts than any other app. Reviews and collections are of great help. Zomato never disappoints!!😊👍👌,5
"Delivery boy Himanshu was very cooperative, soft spoken and took extra efforts to locate the address. It was my first order which I made from Delhi for my friend and Himanshu took extra pain to deliver the order. Thanks Zomato",5
Very very good foods and highgene delivery on time......,5
"very good service 👍 , they delivered me a wrong item but still they provided me a complete refund in very quick time also didn't take the item back.",5
Could have an easier way to log issues.,4
Superb taste Quality and quantity was excellent Good timing Fantastic all,5
"Delivery men have no idea of location & explaining to them is too difficult because they are not from here, hence clueless. Thinking of not using Zomato for this reason.",3
Very bad experience nowadays.. Some of zomato valet r rude and are not following basic instructions.. They do not carry bags and do not handle food with care. Customer care also useless..,1
"Never download. At the time you order any thing by mistake or you want to change your order, if you cancel your order they will Stop you giving cash on delivery facility. Use any other app instead of this Zomato app.",1
"Delivery boy delivered wrong order, been almost 6 months.. no refund no action. Completely useless people. They charge 30% more than Original rate plus add delivery fee and they deliver wrong order. Also not bother about Zomato Gold customer",1
This is a very good app for ordering any food from anywhere,5
"May first order itself not recived properly, where the executive staff who chated on online zomato chat not given proper response , and again the chat has not even starting ..the hell with the staff and app",1
"No point in making a good app when u can't deliver a simple order. And when one is waiting for food for 1.5 hours, u put ur bot .. overall it sucks",1
Very irritating customer care service. We shall wait for hours n hours but will not have any response by their end. I have ordered moradabi biryani from one restaurant in roorkee but was delivered some other item which was not at all worth of eatin. When I have talked to restaurant people they said we do not have moradabadi biryani right now and hence sent that special biryani. I was contacting zomoto customer care but still now no respond from their end. I need my complete refund back.,1
Very sufficient offer just a bad deal . And the zomato price is too more than market price,1
"Good app but delivery charges are very high compared to other food app ,,, order from nearby restaurants they charge very high 😟😟",3
Customer service is pathetic. I've been in conversation with 5 different executives and all of them give standard replies and not able to understand the query at all. Lost money and time and mindspace with this. Ridiculously bad customer service.,1
delivery time not avalable and some delivery boys are taking too much time .,5
"To deliver tea you guys take one hour. Why don't you guys take the issue with restaurant?If I make a decision to cancel the order which is showing a promised time with a very great delay,you guys have an default cancellation fee. I am left with no other option but to accept the delayed delivery. Zomato, don't use the promise delivery idea,if you are not able to monitor the delivery time generated from restaurant.",2
Always a good app. Punch on delivery option should be there. Rest is good.,5
The services are way too better and faster deliveries.,5
"What a useless app. It doesn't appear to be anything other than a directory service, which Google does already. Uninstalled.",1
It is awesome . Really love the voice instruction feature . I can get as I want it to be. But other apps don't have that,5
Worst update ever i have ordered a dish the payment got deducted and it is showing as payment declined and also the app is giving error when trying to chat with the executive .... Updated your app for worst ..,1
The been trying to send the order issue in there chat support. But keep on getting the same reply and the chat takes like forever to start. Bad customer support,1
Have order multiple time always there for serves us ....great app,5
Not bothering about the customers reviews and suppling the parcels and one more thing u app is just stupid like y u give time fake time limit no one need this type of tricks and ur keeping the delivery boys life in risk immediately if won't remove the time limit option I'll complaint to the court on u very seriously,1
Good service and fast delivery,5
"Fast delivery, minimum calling Excellent speed. Nice taste 😋",5
"Used to be good, but now its under talabat, and they ruined it. The offers doesn't make sense. And got more expensive. Terrible !",1
"Very Bad delivery time. At the time of order, app shows delivery time 36 minutes and we have received the order after 1 hr in cold conditions. As per rider he had more than one order to deliver which is 5km away. He can not do any thing . Pls speak to Zomato for this. There is no customer care number available on the websites to answer your query. If you will sent the mail regarding bad service. They will give you a promo code in charity for next purchase, as you are a bigger.",1
Other apps are very good compare to this one. I suffered everytime when I order from this app. Going to uninstall it so that I won't feel cheated again.,1
"It's one the worse service I have ever experienced. From past few months Zomato really pissed me off. It took 2 hour of waiting for dinner and now they have cancelled my order because of operations issue. It's midnight and I have to wake up early for work, now I have to sleep on few snacks If you can't run than shut it down. I am uninstalling Zomato and switching to Talabat or Deliverooo. Thank you Zomato, hope not to see you again. Good luck.",1
"Prices keep increasing every 2 weeks or so, n morever than the price on the menu it's 30% bit more in the app,with all the taxes ...wud say not worth it",1
I order food very often and zomato has made my experience very better with delivery services as there helpline and discounts are always on top and there's a vast collection of restaurants that you can order from.,5
Incredible service from zomato..the food was stale 2 times out of large number of orders & zomato gave us full refund which made our confidence to order again and agents are very supportive as well.,5
I love this app as I am a big foodie. Their service is good. Go ahead and try Zomato folks.,5
"Awesome app and fat delivery , no hassles ,",5
I'm Facing Location problem it is forcing multiple times after clicking ok and agree it to move on please fix this as soon as possible I'm this problem since 1month I'm unable to open App and Place a Order fix this problem as soon as possible................,1
The service of zomato is below average.If order A and restrarent deliver item B.After that if you complain zomato than reply is i will do better next time.If you really want to special dish than not order through zomato.You directly call restrarent he delivered good food.Zomato is agent and all of us know work and service of agent.,1
"Pathetic service. They charge you more in taxes and delivery. Even though if you don't get your food, they don't send replacement or refund. I advice not to order from zomato",1
Absolutely useless customer service and policies. They take no action apart from penalising the customer with a fine for delayed orders. Absolutely disgusting and frustrating,1
Very poor customer support... Think twice before placing any order as they deduct heavily even on immediate cancellation of order,1
"Zomato increases the price of every dish that too more than the double of actual price in the restaurant. Rather than ordering from Zomato, it's better to go there and eat. I Just uninstalled this app.",1
"Whenever you open the App, it starts giving message to open the device location. The message doesn't go even after switching on the location",3
Zomato services are very worst and irresponsible customer service we are ordering one item they delivering another item and not responding I have never seen this any where and customer care is not responding properly food also too worst not 5 star rating hotels I'm reported at 2.30 pm and they not responding swiggy sevices is so better than Zomato services 😡😡,1
Only concern is the delivery charge... which is too much along with the taxes. App is becoming very expensive day by day.,3
Customer agents behavior are very bad. You have to wait for a long time to get the reply.Zomato valet takes delivery charges but they don't check items before collecting offers.,1
Delivery delayed. App not great compared to others. Driver picks up order then travels in opposite direction probably for another delivery. Useless.,1
It is a good app regarding both service and quality in food,5
"Excellent customer care service, got my full refund because of late delivery of food.",3
Map doesn't show zomato valet latest location . Only show delivery pickup to destination path whole time until valet reached to destination. Please resolve it ASAP.,4
"You guys are not good at mapping the address , ordering valets into different locations and pushing them to go within the allocated time,very worst, no concerns foe employees",1
It would be 5 star but the estimated time less than real time. Eg time will show 10 min delivery but its deliver almost 20 min late but still time show less. Call of delivery guy is out of rechable,1
A very good app for foodies. I often order food with this app. It provide 24*7 service. Its customer service is also good.,5
Best app and on time delivery. Best service,5
"besr user interface and food pricing...awesome suggestions for various categories like romantic dinner, pub, hangouts etc...please maintain dis pricing...good work developers👍👍",5
Poor service and support. There is a strike by delivery agents and outlets in chandigarh with zomato however they won't acknowledge and give refund for PRO member that I purchased since they are not able to provide service. All outlets are office in zomato. I will get refund and compensation from consumer court then.,1
They give the discount but they raise the costs of items than the restaurants there by charging a lot from people and if we get wrong orders they don't even care .n they don't respond even .,1
Quite expensive ;Has increased delivery charges.,4
The delivery was very quick..and at the same time it was hot nd good charge for the food items with the promo code...loving to order more and more...good job keep going,5
Happy with this app. Timely delivery.,5
"Delivery is fast, in and polite service",4
"Pathetic app, restaurant contact numbers on app incorrect, delivery boys don't pick up call, if you go to chat, only chatbot answers, pathetic experience, made mistake of using this app.will switch to swiggy now",1
Useless app I never seen. Order takes one hour for each. Delivery boys was worst to deliver the food.,1
"It is a very nice application the discount offers are very nice , and are applicable to many orders . And when it sends you the notification of your name it feels tha that oh someone is there who is caring about you",5
"Love Zomato for its fast delivery, comparitively great offers than swiggy ,",5
Terrible search functionality that seems to get more limited with every update. Plenty of reviews if you what to investigate a specific restaurant but awful for finding something new.,1
Zomato cancels the order after 30 mins of placing the order. They have no option to refund the money immediately. So if the order gets cancelled they dont add it to wallet. So if I am running out of money no way yo reorder as the refund will take 7 working days.,1
Great app....other apps that i installed i can't find the reataurant or cafés near me...but here just one click away and the foods that i love are on my doorstep.,5
Why am i not able to login in it through my old email ID...as the app got deleted accidentally...whenever I try to login it says something went wrong.,1
"Zomato sucks , i bought a coupon and when i tried to apply it the app says ""the coupon dont work anymore"" but the coupon is valid for an another month and is working for others. And the worst thing is there is no way to reach out to them . total fraudster.",1
I have used 1 st time zomato delivery.. It's such helpfull for me and very faster ❤,5
"Extreme high delivery charges. Edit: I dont agree your views. You raise food prices on app than actual hotel prices, on top of that huge amount of delivery charges and taxes.",1
brilliant and efficient...and extremely polite with everything...screw that lady who messed with ull 🙏🏽,5
Support page not even worked.. tapped on support page nothing happened.. opened blank page,1
its hard to check out while paying through card it took me 3 times to be able to place my order coz it shows an error after putting the OTP even though the OTP is correct,2
"This app is a cheat. My order showed 60 minutes time, and when time left was 35 minutes then oll of sudden time went back to 52 minutes, and i am seeing time lefe got stuck at 38 minute from last 10 minutes. Get some shame.",5
Refunds take very long and they won't credit the promised amount..after raising this issue for long time I finally gave up following up with the customer care.,1
Worst app I have ever used they always charge more but thats not the issue they often cancel the payment options as they wish ... wish I could rate it even worse,1
No cancellation after booking....no discount...very disgusting app...I will never order...going to uninstall this app,1
The app restarts every time often. Don't know why. My app is updated. I spend a lot of time waiting for the app to open as it shuts down.,3
"The service is just going down day by day, I went to chat to report the fault in my order and there chat is not working properly there server is not working such a waste",1
Excellent app to order various foods of our choice from the selected restaurants. All the restaurants which were tied with Zomato also very good.,5
"Good delivery and quick services in the pandamic situation, As a human man , like it ZOMATO",4
The taxes and delivery charge are costlier than food worst service nice user interface,1
"From a certain time being, facing issue on ""Apply Promo Code"" option for bill discount in both mobile app and laptop browser in zomato site. Kindly try to check",2
Very easy to use. Good options. Need more options for authentic South Indian matunga in pro.,5
Awesome app. Best ever app to fulfill ur hunger.... Loved it,5
Why do we have to post a picture with our review? Not everyone is in the silly habit of clicking photos of their food. Especially if the food looks okay on the outside however makes us sick.,1
"Very good service, and also good feature in app good to use",5
Fast delivery and smooth application interface,5
"Useless support, they can't even connect with the vendor for correcting the errors in delivery. And then they denied me refund for wrong delivery.",1
"Even if there is an address,. That the location is wrong,. Cancellation of order,. Do not give money back,. Some of these are painful. That is Zomato",2
"Quick delivery, good food quality, descent price, delivery charges are quite high, rest everything is good to go !",4
Amazing. Sweet and polite delivery guys. I like the feature where they specifically detect the location,5
Delivery prices are overwhelmingly high. One would skip ordering only because of extra charges of delivery. On that taxes are added. Everyone is looting now.,3
Very poor delivery. The delivery boy didn't bring the full order and argued about that. I called Customer care many times but no one received the call. Shame on you Zomato.,1
Good services but delivery charges are too high,4
App crashes on splash. Not able to open th application.,1
Thank you very much for a wonderful app.In this Corona situation this will help us without going outside,4
If you are looking for a Mexican food then this place is a must visit as it severs all the Mexican staple another plus point its pure vegetarian so even jains can try this place. Coming to the food we had. 1) Mexican Bowl: We choose paneer as the base option along with mashed beans and all the sauces. The taste was mild and brown rice were cooked to perfection 2) Burrito : In buritoo we had similar topping but the base was of Peri Peri potatoes and we excluded beans 3) Tacos : We tried the ha,5
I do not know why it is adding wrong address to its own to my address typed. Also magi Ping wrong location and not able to locate it properly.,1
"Really love this app, I don't have to worry, sometimes if I dont want to cook. Offers are also good at zomato.. Fast service with tasty food.",5
Even for prepackaged items a packing charges of around 40 to 50 rupees is charged. This is an understanding between Zomoto and the restaurants. This amount is perhaps shared between them. It's just a easy money. Our inability to go to the restaurant is encashed. Users may note this point,4
"I have been charged for pro membership for free delivery, there is no free delivery and when inquired about the same I was updated that delivery charges will be applicable and when asked for cancellation and refund. My pro membership was cancelled without any refund. Zomato Pathetic service and cheaters",1
"Excellent but after opting pro ,it is more cheaper.",5
"The discount% is getting reduced everyday and in the offer, they say 50% and get 80 rupees .. And the rate of food is increasing like the rate of gold.",5
Too much of a clutter. A lot of text on the screen. Cannot easily find information I need.,1
Worst experience and pathetic service...I didn't receive my order after waiting for 3 hours and now status showing as delivered...no response from customer support...no way to reach out to them...Swiggy is far more better than Zomato,1
"Very costly food,delivery charges are too high .not at all affordable .better to call restaurants directly instead of calling zomato",2
"Prices are more than real restaurants price and heavy delivery charges.eg:20rs for distance,delivery 30rs and price high for menu eg: 30, total 80rs charging extra and taxes.",1
Unable to edit last review of last delivery and restaurant closes before 06 30 pm,1
I downloaded it several times but always comes out not available in our current location,1
Very bad... The food doesn't get delivered. The customer support sucks. They only repeat their monotonous lines no issue resolving. No refunds nothing. DO NOT ORDER FROM ZOMATO.,1
UI could be better. There is no map search option to see all the restaurants nearby in a single view.,4
Earlier it was good . I order my food and the food was stinciking and i called delivery boy to exchange the order he is not still exchanging and when im trying to chat with zomato it is showing it is taking time try againg not happy with zomato👎,1
One of the worst chat support 2nd rate policies and one of the worst services and ohh the app works great no issue in the softwear,1
Best app for ordering food and staffs are cordial too.,5
Worst service.....they show that your order will be delivered in 30 min. But took more than an hour to deliver food.,1
The web app is a bit buggy and does not have that many discount offers. But zomato surely offers a lot of variety to choose from and that is the biggest positive on this app,3
Zomato is life savior. One of the best food delivery app. Owe many thanks to the best delivery executives. Offers are really good. Options are the best.,5
"I've had a great time with zomato... much better than swiggy... Also , better offers :)) and the notifications aren't that constant and annoying. Most Delivery executive's are kind .",5
Zomato thinks people are stupid. They charge 50rs additional for 100rs dish. On that sometimes items are nissing from the order and their customer care is so dumb that even after explaining them several times they keep asking u to mail the query and still dn't understand.,1
"Worst service, delivery took almost 1hr just for 3km distance restaurant.. if I could've gone directly & brought the food in 30mins. Worst experience with Zomato.",1
My experience is very nice . I loved the app. But the thing that i disliked is we can't order cash on delivery above rupees 350.,4
Your Support executives are not helpful. I had been trying to react out any executive but every time I start support chat it tells me to mail the query but nobody reverts back to the query,1
Poor delivery service. Estimated Delivery time does not match the actual time. Orders are being clubbed for delivery adding to delay.,1
"You will never get the refund back. And zomato is not ready to take up the responsibility for the refund. I ordered 3 weeks back and the order was cancelled due to delivery guy's delay. I didnt get my refund till the date. ZOMATO is not even ready to compensate my money with other coupons or some other payment mode, even though it was their fault. And this kind of problem never arose when I ordered from other apps. Same issue happened for my friend.",2
"The app is slow ,sometimes not working ,sometimes it takes order ,sometimes not .Worst app",1
delivery costs are at least 2 to 3 times that of swiggy.. .location detection issues....plus it engulfed and took down uber eats to set a monoply....but I hope that other apps develop soon to maintain the competition,2
The food delivery is delayed for more than an hour. They have not even called and notified for the delay. No response when trying to call delivery vallet,2
Fastest delivery and awsome test very nice service i love it 😋😋,5
Good app but stores are updating invalid contact numbers.,2
I used uber eats! Now I'm completely satisfied with ZOMATO with upgrading featured related to refund or any queries on fingertips along with amazing offers. Highly recommended to all. Try it once to get offers 👍😍,5
"First time ordered, very happy, fast derived, have many payment options,..... Thanks zomato.",5
"Delivery charges are more when compared to other vendors , and have checked the price at the same time before ordering with the other vendors as well , delivery charges are costly as compare to other",2
Worst experience in app usage and no on time support from customer end worst app to order food should stop there operation when they can't satisfy customer needs . Your unique ticket ID for the reference is 7301380,1
"clock does not move further, Pizza ordered at 2003 and at the time writing it is still showing 17 minutes. Poor service. No vallet asigned till now.",1
Once i ordered something from zomato and items were missing from it i rasied query asked for return request or refund but get nothing these app is fraud swiggy is far better,5
They delayed the delivery by 30 minutes and not fullfilling about refund. The option of refund they will not do and they had given me rs.25/- for their bad service against order of rs.510/-. I will never suggest anybody Zomato,1
zomato provided good food service. I am very happy with Zomato services. I like to this app.,5
Items will miss like in biryani lemon and onion salads curd not got everytime . Worst coustamer service systemis chat all,1
Worst app. Extremely high price for low quantity food. Atrocious and fake discounts. Very High delivery cost. Worst service. If possible I would like to give zomato 0 star for 5 star.,1
"No matter how much this company grows, they always have fake delivery timings. And they don't even feel bad about it. When you are placing an order, the delivery time would be 20 mins, the moment the order is confirmed, it automatically goes up to 30-32 mins. Are we fools? Shame on you zomato",1
They are giving multiple orders to a vallet where in if a customer. Is in a hurry they can't reach on time.. And also exchange of food can also be happen..it happened once..,1
Hopeless customer service. Needs a lot more improvement than one can think of. Zomato a brand now. Chat support is expected to be polite.,1
I was charged extra on the zomato app. the rates mentioned in the app were significantly higher compared to the actual menu rates of the restaurant.,1
"Horrible experience with zomato. They are so unprofessional. Their delivery was so late for one of my orders and the driver kept going to the wrong place and finally the food reached very cold and late and when I contacted zomato, they told me they are not ready to do anything about this but will try to serve me better in the future. Of course I've decided never to order through them again. But extremely disappointed with the obvious lack of customer service HORRIBLE",1
Very Bad experiance from Zomato..i bought pro membership..but after sometime it stop showing me all resturants..and show only 2 resturnts are delivering..my wife's app which is not pro member showing all resturnts...just looted me..... Also customer support is very bad I am suggesting Zomato to stop looting your good customers..,1
Frustrated doesn't support chat or customer care it's more than hour I am not aware of my order status,1
"App has good collection of restaurants, easy to order, timely delivery and good live tracing. Keeps customer well informed about status of order.",4
The app is very affective and gives proper information regarding the delivery time and also easy to navigate the app. It also gives small small knowledge based information related to food part.,5
"Really good service, Quick delivery, Provides restaurant details and good offers. I love your service",5
"Worst online food ordering ""Zomato wallet don't pick calls, customer service representative can only chat, most of the time food delivery is late (That's pretty much the standard in Zomato)""",1
great service but some dishes is so high Price,5
Fraudulent company!!!! They gave me a coupon and i could only use it for half the price of the coupon i received. The pending is not even reflecting in my portal anymore.,1
Good app and thank you for satisfying our needs with 100% trust,5
Bad experience. Now a days minimum order value required (rs 250) to get food. It isn't affordable for one person.,1
This a good option to get better food with quality,5
Good app with good food experience. In some cases restaurants were not upto the ratings specified. Hence cut a star.,4
Star rating 0 nhi hai warna wahi deta bad service by zomoto I ordered by one an half half over still showing 11 min you will get..... again I check after half an hour still showing same where is my order,1
Very bad customer care - Unprofessional Standard reply to every thing No solutions .... Only delay of issues These apps should be responsible to customer and to retail shops ... As they are a service provider and taking commission from restaurant.....,1
App is good. But there is one issue. Why it has stopped cash on delivery option now? Fix it please,3
Happy with the service and offers of zomato. New app update is helpful.can share details about food and its quality.Service is rendered across places which is great..,5
"I have placed an order from which items were missing. I contacted Zomato and they said they apologize and that I have a good day and stopped responding. Zomato has one of the worst customer service. I ended up throwing away the food as without the rest I cannot eat the delivered part of food. I highlighted this to the escalation agent, but he ignored and closed the call without resolving my issue. I urge all to stop using Zomato who have such poor services and customer care agents",1
Nice application for foodie lovers & delivery food on time.,5
Cafe another day is one of the best places in Janakpuri. The cappuccino coffee taste so good and the staff are very courteous. This Cafe is one of the finest places to dine in Janakpuri for any social gathering.,5
Pathetic application the cost of all the food is more than the restaurant actually charges and the delivery fee is very high also the coupons provided discounts provided are pathetic as compared to other food ordering applications,1
This food delivery app is so awesome and it takes good care of food and delivers at a perfect time limit. Thank you.,5
NO VERBAL COMMUNICATION. NO WAY AVAILABLE TO CANCEL A ORDER MADE INADVERTENTLY. THERE SHOULD BE A small TIME GAP TO CANCEL A ODRER.,3
Great food delivery app. Keep up the good work,5
Horrible delivery and the waiting time was more than 1 hour.,1
You have to give a option so we can know that which valet is. Know the local area not. And. Check the valet. Device. Also. . Many time there tracker is not working,1
"These people doesn't have any sense of customer satisfaction, I meant customer service not delivery guys, frequently ordered restaurants delivery was suddenly stopped saying it is not deliverable to your location and by raising this issue with customer service the didn't give any valid reason also.. simply pathetic customer service..thumbs down , I did not expect this from zomato...",1
The same pro membership is made available to new users annually while the existing users for a similar price get it only for 3months - nice way of showing gratitude to existing customers. Extremely disappointed.,1
"Order something and we'll get something else, no proper customer support and listed restaurants are copies of original brand which are costly, overrated and serve low quality food. So far I was deceived 3 times not going to use again deleting account.",1
Totally Worst app I have ordered a item and it is showing your order will be delivered in next 10 min but from last 25 minutes the order is not delivered and still it is showing your order will be delivered in next 10 minutes,1
I'm absolutely in love with this app!! It's really easy to use and really helpful for fulfilling my greed in lockdown. Thank you Zomato!,5
No censent taken before making payment. Order summary not displayed before ordee confirmation. Support very ineffective...no escalation or call back option.,1
Delivery charges are quite much...and food is also quite expensive...you charge 25% from the restaurant...and still you take delivery charges...pathetic,3
"I think my previous decision is good that the customer service is wrost and going to wrosted, keep going, people is watching and after sometime you'll notice and at that time it's too late",1
Extra charges taken for food and after this also taken distance charges delivery charges packing charges and final tax too much expensive in this condition,1
Zomato valets were n will be having very reckless behavior which will affects zomato directly. They make the customers wait for more than delivery time and meanwhile valet cancel the order on there way and the app displays the map where valet went missing lol. Anyways customer care service responds for any queries..,1
Very bad. ubereats were far better. Delivery charges is very high. Customer support system is very poor. I got food poison after eating from certain hotels.,1
worst delivery timing. It showed me 23 min. but 34 mins. passed and the app still sowing 8 mins. 😑😑 I will never use this app again. 🙏,1
"Zomato is getting worse day by day. Looks like a Fraud to me , firstly u charge hefty amount than restaurant rates plus u mention regular on app and I get a small meal. When I reach out to you guys u make me wait for half an hour and hand me over a refund of rs. 50/- for a meal of 225/- . You guys are looting us in such crucial covid 19 situation. Hope there are better competitors for u who can really help their customer with better and transparent services.",1
"Poor customer service. The few times I have had to raise an issue, the operator always appears to place the onus of blame onto the customer. Going to switch to another service.",1
The order just placed and immediately realised that the delivery address was different. Tried to change at very moment but this app does not have that ooption. This is hopeless,1
"This app is damn slow, till the time it runs food can be cooked",1
"It's the best food ordering app I have ever used, atleast its better than swiggy. It has regular discount offers and also gives very fast delivery.",5
"Very bad experience, the biryani locks only tempting but is rock there was no piece of chicken in it..... 😡😤😠",1
Very gud experience and hospitality was at next level by worker. I love to order my food from zomato,5
High delivery charge. High taxes for popular brands. No control over menu price as restaurants are charging more then original menu price. Zomato gold has become useless.,1
Unprofessional behavior from the customer care.I have given the address and the delivery guy was no where near my house as I was tracking and they cancelled my order that they couldn't reach me and charged me a cancellation fee too.,1
"Sorting , suggestion , delivery, quality everything is perfect in this application. Love it!",5
"Am a usual Swiggy user but i am forced to give 5 stars to Zomato now is because of on reason which is utmost important too...swiggy in my area shuts its doors by 11pm or max 11.30pm only but Zomato is a ""LIFE SAVER"" for me because i work from home online USA time and late night Swiggy loses the battle with Zomato...ihad become a MEGA FAN of Zomato for this reason alone....keep rocking ZOMATO 👍🏻",5
Waited for one and a half hours with hungry stomach only to know that restaurant is closed. Can't you guys figure this out quickly? Also there has to be a compensation for making customer wait for so long.,1
Such a poor service by online chat agent and as well I was unable to find where to redeem my Zomato pro promo code and when I texted live chat he had given such poor service with very slow message after taking a while Id never use this app,1
Its marvelous app. Anytime anywhere always helpful..really great experience. My suggestion is if u can begin ur services in subborn areas too. It will outstanding.,5
Basically all locations should be provided to every hotel like dominoz dosent deliver at my location so its so difficult and their bags should be like the food should be hot everytime and most problem is in winters,4
If any order is cancelled by zomato. They will take 5-7 days to refund. Such a worst service. All the bank will transfer immediately. They are making money as a interest keeping in bank.,1
Convenient. Variety of outlets to choose from. Suits every budget. Very easy to track and navigate.,4
Surprised to see the restaurant packing charges imposed by Zomato in addition to the delivery charges.. the same packaging charges disappear if we order take away directly from the restaurant,1
Best app for home delivery. Reliable and corteous delivery boys. 👍👍👍,5
"Offers shown on screen, are not working at the time of payment",1
"My recent experience with the app has been very good hence decided to upgrade my rating from 3 to 5 Quick delivery, very good options and optimal charges",5
"Zomato must also add this 1:- Non veg, which having chicken/mutten there must be mentioned is halal or jhatka . 2:-the time of order in bold must be on order section .",3
Restart delivering groceries as well. Swiggy is delivering groceries.,1
"Service and everything is good but pricing is more restaurant charge and zomato charges will be different they are taking 20 or 10 rps extra and delivery charges , but they are giving good offers and all",3
Hate it there is no minus rating they Always delivered wrong food and even though reported with proof no action was taken,1
"Not bad but, unable to get proper delivery person map, it was showing too delay. Hope u will solve this issue ASAP.",3
"Customer support executive are very poor in handling customers issue. Even the do not reply on time, I have been Zomato's customer for last 3 years, but never expected this from Zomato. Very poor customer service and very poor resolution.",1
Amazing app! There are so many coupons even after your first order and the food delivery time is less compared to other apps.,5
"Timely delivery & ryt upto the mark...got many food options, professional and quick service, KFC doesn't deliver at certain areas which can be worked upon. Rest everything looks good...I'd surely recommend Zomato app ...loved it madarchodo",5
"My opinion is is waste service,bcz many time got quality less and smell foods ,and too late also , customer care not responding many times i disappointed in quality food",1
"The application is very well programmed and easy to use it for order, I recommend that the programmers add photos for each type of order and ingredients details for menus",4
Excellent and Very easy to use. I love this app.,5
Great service at reasonable price.,5
Terrible app. Customer support is worst. I raised complaint in Gmail more than 4 times still no response. Why this app on editor choice!?,1
I love there messing part the messages from Zomato ar very funny and makes me feel ordering from this app,5
Nice delivery app but i can't add some stuff that i like to eat :(,4
"Navigation not working propey, restaurants taking too much time to prepare the food, I wait arround 1 hrs.. But delivery boy not able to deliver the order cause of both issues I mentioned above.",1
"Don't judge a book by it's cover. Being a girl I can say loudly,many of women in our country used to take disadvantages of being a girl.They thought that they'll get another special attention if they do so.Without Knowing the actual truth you don't have any right to blaim a man..and kick him out of his job..with an unusual baseless issues. It's my earnest request to giving him compansation,and give his job back. and punish the girl..who got already millions of followers with her crocodile tears.",1
"I love the app but I would give it 5 stars if Zomato added an option of ""been there"" as well!",4
kindly tell the shop owners there must Not be any difference in Pic & the original order delivered Even not in presentation🙏🙏🙏,5
Had a very worst experience .Showing the status as delivered but have not received order.And delivery agent is not picking up call.Even zomato customer care is not responding properly.,1
"If you ordered the food for the Tiffin they will definitely give the food for the lunch time🥳✌️ I'll appreciate the delivery timings, It's takes just 1hr to deliver the order..When your are so hungry just order the food in Zomato 😤🤗",1
This a very helpful app. If you do not want to go outside your house.,5
Placed an order almost an hour ago....since that time its showing order is arriving in 7 minutes (pood being prepared)...on the online Chat I was told it was delayed and I was given a number (a link) to call...when I called the guy said he's off line and he has no order to pick,1
Its a very good app for ordering and the food so delicious . You can install it .its a helpful app.and again its a very good app,5
I ordered pizza through zomato and I received it in an abysmal condition.! And when I tried to get help from zomato support they told me that they cannot help me as Dominoes will handle such issues. Then what is the point of ordering through zomato? I might as well stop using it. If I order through zomato then I expect zomato to help me with the issue. Now I have no food to eat today and dominoes tells me that they MIGHT be able to help in 2 DAYS.,1
Nice place the manager of the outlet Shabir is a pleasant person to talk to. He recommends the best dishes on or off the menu . Takes good care of the customer and is knowledgeable as well Thanks once again. My suggestion have some good offers on starters like u have for the drinks,5
I had some horrible experience specially when i have done online payment with them. Worst deliver system,1
Amazing experience most of the time...its very helpful for me during this time...exploring different menus and always right on time regarding delivery. 🤩👍👌,5
"Horrible customer service, no idea what they doing, tracking system doesn't work. It's just pain using the app",1
"Zomato is the fastest growing application and user friendly. Such bettet experience makes people life easy, convenient and reliable. Very good service. User experience is so much enhanced and fast, pleasant.",5
poor service.. delivery time keeps on increasing. average delivery time is of over 45 min..even if restaurant is only 5 km away.,1
"Order delivery time not running according to the clock if it shows 15 minutes to deliver the order, after 30 minutes at the time of delivery still it shows 3 minutes remaining to deliver. False delivery timing. I have took the screen shots of false timing. Is Zomato Cheating Us? I say Yes",2
User friendly app for fast food delivery which is linked with all top food centres all over the city...,5
App has become extremely slow in the past week Please try and resolve,2
"Dear All, If anyone providing the service without the bill, simply means that it is performing dishonestly. We should avoid using these type of apps because we don't know from where the food is coming. I hope you all understand and take care of you and your family",1
Best in the market and friendly and simple UI. all kind of payment methods accepted including sodexo as well. You can see small food centers also in the zomoto.,5
zomato is the best app i had... every dishes delivery was super,5
"These people are fooling customers by sending rotten food to customers, and if you connect to their customer support, instead of solving the problem they disconnect the chat, worst app.",1
These app will confirm order will delivery within 30 mins but it's more than 1 hr. Why they suggested the timings... If contact call center they won't response,1
The chat support is very bad i have been waiting for the reply from half an hour,1
Good experience to use this app all parameters they use it during social distancing time.yill the date of today have a good experience.im giving review and rating of present experience don't know about the future hopely they would give best service as they do in these days👍🏻👍🏻,4
"Excellent environment, friendly service, great menu choices and really decent food and at affordable prices.",5
Food is good and fast mode of delivery,1
Its awful.these people are taking order n cancelling after 45 min by themselves only... Delivery boy was so rude... Zomato customer care people are also not enterning the issue..this was my last order with Zomato n will uninstall the App n will try to spread to more and more people so that people remain alert n not to use Zomato... Very Bad Experience ..-100 rating for ZOMATA,1
"Started well but now it is full of junk restaurant below average, amateur vallets and rude behaviour. Worst customer service. Overall not a professional delivery service.",2
It is such a great app! The delivery person's attitude was very polite and I use this app very often and every time my order is on time 😊 Happy with the services provided by this app.,5
"This delivery is awesome, my food was arrived in only 20 min. And it has great offers to use and get the price even cheaper",5
"Chat support was poor. When problem reported were not addressed it so useless to even have it which is of time, energy n money waste.",1
"My experience is always good for zomato..i like the food , delivery timings and all.if whenever i have some issues, about taste or quality of food zomato always there to solve any kind of problem..",5
Exceptional delivery speeds til date. Prices are less compared with the other food delivery giant. Keep it up..!,5
Amazing app experience! Best recommendations and trustworthy restaurant reviews. Customer support is polite and considerate. 🥳P.S. Person handling meme/ig account and app notifications deserves a raise 💯😂,5
Nice app.. user friendly.. easy navigation.. I like it,5
"It is surviving just because of convenience to customers otherwise neither customers nor restaurants like their services. The prices on Zomato are always higher by 50% to 100% as compared to actual menu rate of the restaurant. @Zomato, I don't need your response I know what is it!",1
Cannot explain the problems related to the order...have to only select the option s they ll provide for query....the zomato chat is the worst feedback service there is,2
Very nice offer and delivery person are also manner with good nature,4
Gives very expensive food. This is a good swiggy from the app.,1
I never get disappointed whenever i use this app these guys make delivery as fast as they can and are hilarious i just love this !!!!,5
Very cool app to use and it also gives quick delivery,5
Werest service customer service is very bad items are missed in my order but they not responding properly verybad,1
The food price is double as mentioned on the resturent price chart. and the distance fees and unnecessary charges/taxes are also cheating towards customer. 40% off is also a cheating policy,4
This app is very nice.and with in minutes bring the amount..very nice app,5
"Being a loyal client of zomato, I vouch for their utmost promptness and professionalism. Sometimes when the food gets delayed due to traffic or other reasons, I get the discount coupons for my next order just instantly. All the delivery staff have been absolutely polite, decent and highly professional. Truly appreciate the standard they've maintained all these years. Kudos!!",5
"Worst.....zomato cant resolve query I ordered pizza form dominos and order late by 1 hour, and 1 item is missing ..and no body picked up call ,and zomato said query will resolve in next two days ....",1
Very convenient and perfect food delivery app,5
Really good and a best tool when you are hungry simultaneously don't have the time to go out to buy food.,5
What's wrong with Zomato. This guys manipulate the countdown so they can pretend that everything is running on time even though you have been waiting for hours they'll regularly show you only 10mins remaining ..,1
"Even this 1 star goes to the delivery executive for their time and responsibilities which currently Zomato as a company doesn't know at all! Frankly speaking as a student i ignored many cancellation ( from Zomato's end ) , many miscommunication between the restaurant and Zomato which eventually i had to sacrifice in terms of waiting for my food also no loyalty benefits . Now i can't tolerate the rudeness of costumers support rudeness and no more pricey food in addition to high delivery fees.",1
"Subscriber of Gold Membership, after one hour of order they calling and says partner haven't your food item in stock. Waste of Money and time.",1
"Very bad customer support. Literally, you should eat what that comes to you, not what you have ordered for. Very bad experience. And your service is as bad as your pre-match analysis.",1
"Nonsense Zomato In every order there is something missing from the ordered items. When I complaint it, they said that sorry for it we will take your feedback and share with restaurant but didn't refund the money of missing items to me ☹️☹️",1
Worst experience..it didn't ask for location and placed the order showing that it has detected my current location..I paid..and i didn't get food,1
"Worst customer service experience. My order was not delivered. A good portion of the order was missed out and I had to spent 45 mins with customer service to explain this. They kept on passing it on to other specialists. Finally the guy was arrogant and he said you figure out this with the restaurant. Also refund an amount which doesn't even match what I spend on the missing portion of the order. Even after explaining that and mentioning on writing feedback for Zomato, he didn't care at all",1
"Zomato is not helpful at all. I have received a wrong order, Zomato said that they will refund my money but now it is almost 2 months still not received my money. So my advice don't trust this kind of online platform.. swiggy is better than Zomato.",1
Awesome experience till now fast response and actually you guys are completely driving CX experience .,5
I orderd food from dominos from zomato and a item was missing as soon i reported it to zomato all they did was sending too much of messages no other help or i didnt get refunded .It better to go with swiggy,1
"Few restaurants food price is higher than compare to the actual price they sell. If quantity detail of items mentioned, it will be nice",3
What a app to order food 🍲.. It's really amazing and should be appreciated . I am using it since 2019 . It's a safe app and it's delivery is also safe especially during COVID-19🦠😷.,5
"Again order is cancelled today, wow. I am adding this today, 12march 2021 , Below is my previous post Really bad , consecutively 2 orders were cancelled , only refund offered , if in other nation they will give free meal for such situation , also customer service agent can only say apologies .... really bad service and further more really bad staff.. so sad .",1
"Regarding the delivery boy issue which is been trending right now. The delivery boy has not done anything wrong,he has just been some 15min delay while delivering the order, except that the delivery boy has not done anything wrong. So please look into this issue and hire him as soon as possible.",1
"Placed an order, took the previous order's mobile number by default. Didn't received my food, neither got the money back. Silly application.",1
"If i have an option of zero rating definitely i would have given, worst app at all food is worst and after informing to tge executive they also don't consider it and don't resolve it...i recommend not to use zomato worst app And i want to file a suit against them but even it is also time waste that's the reason I'm ignoring otherwise definitely i would do that",1
Very good delivery Zomato is safe and fast delivery I like you Zomato keep it up,5
This app takes 5 months to load up 5 months to search for ur restaurant another 5 months for payment type and then finally 5 months for delivery to be confirmed. Thats a total of delete the app and use your laptop browser,2
Good & easy app But is facing only 1 problem. Can't change the current address which is wrong.,4
"Not satisfied fake discounts.. charigng extra on MRP of the restaurants menu.. and delivery charges are huge... Finally, we dont get any discounts...",1
"Everytime tried in good hope...but food never arrived in time, rather such late that don't even feel to eat. absolute failure on Zomato part!!",1
"Pathetic customer support. Takes 2 hrs to deliver food. No commitment to delivery time. Won't cancel food so u can get food from elsewhere. Don't order from Zomato, just call the hotels.",1
Variance in restaurant's prices and zomato's prices are too much. I ordered biryani and zomato charged almost 200rs more in a bill or 530 rs. Restaurant's bill was 330. Really disappointed and will not use it anymore for food ordering. Swiggy is better,1
Using the app has never been a problem and the deliveries have always been on time. 👍,5
It's a very good app not just for in time delivery but also for offers that come as u go on to use the app...,5
Very worst service all food cost rated double.. Fraud Zomato... Never do buy food in zomato please aware people....If you want to buy in zomato check food costs with restaurant once then you can do purchase....,1
"Nice service, keep it up. Packing and delivery charges have to be reduced. Then promo codes aren't necessary.",4
"Zomato day by day you people are screwing it up. Multiple orders to a single dilevery guy, it took my order more then 1hr, where my parcel was collected long back from the restaurant and was with rider, who was busy delivering other' order Wow 🖕🖕",1
Map location needs to improved. Your dely partner is unable to reach destination in time. Icecream turns into milk by the time the location is found,3
Wrost experience with Zomato app.. Resturant told me they no food available which had oder than why they accepted my oder.. Why r u not able to refund mei have always good experience with u. I don't want give negative feedback. I don't want to affect your image for public. My one negative feedback affects u lot. Thanks,1
The pricing on the zomato menu for specific restaurants and real pricing completely differ. I had to pay 750 extra just for this mismatch in price.,1
Its not give any resolution even if they deliver spillage or leakage food and they ask for photos we send it but no resolution give on chat and also on email Don't use this app for food ordering they are give us bad quality food and charge very much,1
Always given discount price would not be applied and there is a lot of things to be update technically. Please fix it soon,2
"I'm giving 1 rating as today I ordered food that was poor in quality and test. After escalating this issue to Zomato team,simply they replied Do not have control' over food vendor. Zomato can only accept customer feedback so that same issue will not occur in future.........Nice service Zomato. May more things are there to share but not now......I'll ask this concern to FSSAI .how they provided license to such types of companies. What about consumer rights?",1
Good app. I've used it many times but now a days I prefer swiggy more than zomato because of the awesome offers they give. Hope you guys bring back the awesome offers.,5
"This is a fun application, really my heart is happy, with such fast delivery, it is also being given such a safe delivery in this period.",5
Very Good Offers and Good Service in promise time.,5
I like Zomato very much. #fast delivery. The delivery man was very nice.,5
After the update it's become terribly slow and takes about three refreshes and 15 minutes to place one order. Please fix this!,2
Very very bad service...I ordered my food but they didn't send me the food nor back my money..!,1
Bad service and have low quality resturant tag to there app. while deduction they will do immediately but when comes to refund they will take 7 working days. This is non sense service they give,1
"Very quick service, it's amazing",5
Very good service I love this app quickly they give service,5
It keeps on crashing after i updated my phone to android 11,1
Pathetic App experience No resolution to pertinent problems Chat doesn't work most often Order tracking is horrible. Most importantly riders are careless and entirely incompetent.,1
It's a valuable one now a days very easy to get ordering food,5
Simply it's better than any other food delivery app in market right now. I really appreciate Zomato's work and hope to order more. Thank you.,5
"make sure all your riders are familiar on the location and they are argueng to the costumer which is not good they dont have good manners and right conduct, sometimes they are liar ...",1
Liar customer support ever experienced...due to technical glitch in their app location and my actual address had discrepency..upon enquiring they said that rider cannot deliver to your location as he is on cycle..thereafter when we get on a conf call..rider confirmed that he is on a motorbike...they he would not be delivering as ZOMATO does not pay him for the extra miles...conclusion i convinced rider to deliver the food n i will pay him for the same.,1
Worst customer service. They will keep the chat on hold for so long that you'll get frustrated and won't bother to complain again. Pathetic service,1
"Very × 20 times bad service. For every problem they have one solution ""SORRY""",1
Always they add new updates which eventually lowers the discount and ultimately remove them. So Zomato is no more pocket friendly anymore instead it has become pocket drainer.,1
"More I use this app, more satisfaction on each order. Good service, good menu, good time of delivery. Keep up the spirit Zoooooomato. 👍👍🙏🙏",5
Don't even know to resolve a query. Calling back is far,1
"Very nice and best online ordering app +Anywhere from this app valets can go around whole India ,and plus also,This app packing and faster delivery system is mind -blowing but the only thing I have give it 4 stars but not 5 stars it is give some of them food are maked earleir before the ordering only and ,also the delivery food ordering price is too high but ther thig very very very nice good and otherwise ok only from my side that's I think thing ok thanks...Now...😍😍",4
"Takes almost double the time to deliver the order. Delivery person says I have multi order, can't to anything. Better to order from swigy for much faster service",1
Not showing restaurants near my place which are being shown by swiggy. Hence swiggy is better.,1
Very nice experince with zomato - sams pizza.. more discount and testy pizza.. and behavior of delivery boy was too good...,4
"Some items are not shown in main menu of the hotel, but is visble when we search for that particular item.",2
"Restaurants are giving the least priority to app based orders during peak hours, so delivery is getting delayed especially during weekend nights.",5
The delivery is becoming bad day by day and the orders that I'm receiving are destroyed. For instance pizzas base and cheese are separate from each other.,1
Cheater even showing 50 percent discount. And price hiked too much. Even direct book with restaurant anyone can get much better deal. Torally bad experience will never use,1
Poor quality check team. They are growing with great pace but not taking care of customer feedback. No corner for pure healthy food.,1
Nice one. Food was delivered when it was expected. Live location for tracking was available.,5
Very easy for order and nice service,5
Fantastic app and Will continue to give us a lot of discounts thank you 🔥zomato🔥,5
"App is good. You ask few questions like packing material, but the restaurants doesn't follow them.",4
Awesome service in Bhilai I had given 5 star earlier but a lot of updates have reduced the smooth UI. I am unable to find the option to opt for Zomato Pro,3
Good App but there are no promo codes to apply and there is no customer satisfaction.But your competitor like swiggy have this feature which detoriates the popularity of Zomato. I hope you will work on it,4
Refund and return policies are not clear. Don't put you in touch with a supervisor. all I got was an apology for a wrong order which doesn't solve the problem at all.,3
they made gud hygiene food with standard quality... at least you all should try it at once because its new so they provide huge range of varieties in cakes I hope they doing as well in future. gud luck best wishes....,5
Incomplete order what about the ordered items u charged but not delivered,1
Food partner are very good...but the delivery guys doesn't have liquid cash(change)with them most of the time(even they don't have ₹100 change).,4
i am extremely disappointed by the food served at barista...such fooling of the customers just to make money is nowhere accepted..seriously who wants to spend their hard earned money on such tasteless food..the whole point is to fill our stomach and have a good time with our friends family whom so ever..and they are just disappointing us to another level..spoiling our beautiful moments..who gave you the right man..nhi hota toh chod do kuch aur krlo man😑😠,1
i used this app for several months....starting the app is very useful to me later i didnt find the cash on delivery in payment option....that made me to hate this app,3
From the last 2 weeks the zomato service is really pathetic. Your order will be always late delivered and the app will claim your food is delivered before time. Nice sense if humor Zomato.,1
Very poor service .They took my order and kept me waiting for more than 1 hr showing your order is being prepared and at last minute cancelled my order without my knowledge .Very unprofessional!,1
"I gave 3 star's for the services of zomatto team and cutt two star's because they didn't deliver certain places. What if person wants to eat that place?? Overall good and I'm impressed with Zomato marketing team 😚 they send funny, attractive and good notifications about food. 😂",3
"Extremely Bad experience..I had ordered with some cooking instructios which were not followed at all due to this I could not eat my dinner and when I complaint about it to zomato people they say we are sorry and will take care next time. I had to throw the entire food, as it was not eatable and more over could not place another order or go out due to 11.00 pm curfew. I demanded my money back but these people bluntly refused to do so.. Extremely disappointed with zomato.",1
"Pathetic, the services has become best to worst..Map doesnot update, interface is poor..delivery time increases almost every time...But I know Zomato doesnot care..so let it be.",1
"My first order with zomato.. poor experience.. swiggy seems much more better, never faced any issue",1
The App is bcuming worse day by day. Payment done thru Google Pay shows decline all the time and sometimes amount is debited but order is not successful done. Plz work on yur payment system asap,1
Beautiful and smoothly delivered. Very tasty food.,5
"Not delivered to my room, i did not reveive my order given food. Its worest experience to me.",1
this restaurant provide very bad food quality... even they provide previous day food to uu... if u complain about their food then they start argument with uu. and after that they are not responding to u not on call or not on msg... no taste no quality no t cooked good... very bed service,1
After using all the online food delivary apps ...this is the best one. Ease of using .no cheating like swiggy(if delivary location is far from city swiggy says delivary partner got bike repair ),5
It was resolved thank you but please work upon the mis leading images that are shown by the seller. As they show something else and delivery something else.,4
Sometimes the prices on the zomato app are higher than the prices at the restaurant. So the discount on the higher price brings it to the actual price of the item on the menu in the restaurant so logically there is no discount.,2
"The order should have a time slot, example between 7 and 8 pm or 9 pm like that, so that orders can be placed well in advance",3
"Couldn't give any less a rating. Worst customer service as compared to Swiggy. Delivers wrong items or gets delayed very often. Also, cancels orders without update. Bitter experiences to the tee. Vexed.",1
"It's been a good and satisfactory experience , hopefully you could add more fields to the app especially pharmacies.",5
"I enjoy using it , never had a bad experience till date and most food reviews on the app seems true to the dot.",5
"I am really, disappointed, as I was getting COD but from. Yesterday suddenly the COD option state its not eligible, as I never cancel my orders or never rated bad to any restaurant or any valet... I just can't understand why COD is not there and I feel so irritated that I deleted my account, hope @zomato will solve this so I can enjoyy food...",1
Pathetic service.......ordered food from a restaurant wich was just 2.5 kms away ...they claimed 36 mins but got it almost 1hr. Andthis was not the 1st time it happened.,1
You pay but delivery of your food is a huge risk! What kind of stupid idiotic policy do yoy guys have of cancelling orders? I ordered food yet it was not delivered cuz my cell phone was not reachable ? I contacted you asap the order cancelled message was shown on its own yet you refused for reattempt of delivery cuz it's against policy? Why ? Did the food evaporate in thin air? And no refunds cuz It's against policy too! Zomato nor restaurants take responsibility for your food after payment.,1
"It takes lot's of time to get the order on hand... If we order at 5.00 then it will come at 6.30..so, that should improve .. others all thing is really good..",4
"Pathetic service, if you are craving for dinner don't use zomato. Their valet will not pick your call and there is no support from zomato.... I don't want give any star but we don't have option.... Won't recommend anyone to order from zomato specially in night and even in day.....",1
Most helpful app..Excellent service providers..Big thank u to zomato specially from working womens..,5
Service was very good and very much helpful in Covid period,5
"All good. Payment option shows offers for specific card. When added that card, it says its not applicable. Need to improve on this.",4
"Zomato delivery partner works really hard and really appreciate their customer no matter what. Being a woman I know when you order late eve foods how they should maintain distance and greet accordingly to the female customers, Zomato never dissappoints me in that everytime I have ordered. Sometimes delivery partners do not know how to locate the customer address but they try so why could not we try to have patience and guide them, so if you can help them we can also get proper service.",5
Very poor experience. Order is delivered too late n no one is there available for costumer support. Very poor service.,1
"So far, so good. Could be better in terms of search engines as per locality, still an issue",4
"Kudos to the delivery guys and the support team..what u guys do really takes u to a next level of dedication, professional customer support and empathy.have been tracking and ordering food for years and not once disappointed. Users. Please be empathetic and pleasant the same way how the employees go beyond expectations to help us.Also on a greater note.I applaud on how the zomoto mgmt handled situation related blore case . Thanks for standing by for both the delivery agent mr kamaraj n customer",5
Best food delivery app.. Specifically while quarantine period...,5
"they are increasing price of foods from rs100 to 150 in their app , apart from extra delivery charges,packing charges,tax .. actually we are paying double the amount of food + ( delivery charge+ packing charge+Gst)...swiggy also doing the same",3
"This app is as bad as it charges extra 40 during the peek hours and deliver the food after 1-2 hrs that would not be satisfactory, swiggy is a much better app than this",1
Changing my review as zomato has delivered my food to the exact address although my address was quite interior and the delivery agent was also very patient and well mannered...so five stars from my side to zomato..keep it up 👍,5
easy to use....easy to make payment...availability of more varieties...soft spoken delivery persons...,5
Good app for order online. It gives good discount to all..,4
It was very bad experience today. The delivery person was asking us to come and collect in mid way.And did not delivery at doorstep.saying address in wrong in bill.i am using this app and register with my house address.bill was having wrong address.kindly investigate.,5
Worst experience with customer support they won't give replies for our issues after some 15min they ask our issue and at most of the time they won't give cash on delivery options seriously the customer is support is worst the any other food delivery apps,1
"THE WORST FOOD DELIVERY APP IN THE UAE. I have never had any issue with any other food delivery app in the UAE. If you don't mind waiting for 2 hours before they cancel your order then download this app. Otherwise, don't waste your time. Utterly incompetent.",1
Never seen such a worst app where the agents are not even responding and talking in a bad way.pls don't go for this app this will not make u happy.. I don't have an option to add images else I owuld have addeenitnas well,1
I had few bad exp where I order and got pathetic service. I has sent u pics as well.. Try to work on it.. Thank u🙏,3
"My experience is better with Zomato as compared to other food ordering apps in Dubai. I also like the idea of adding online tip, it makes giving tip much more easier when making payment through card.",5
Every time restaurant skip or forget to fulfill the orders and there will be a system to cross check the order that all will taken or not,1
Gives a proper time if delivery.. live tracking is very good. The people delivering are also very polite. Pls continue the good work.,4
"My food was one minute delayed from promised time. At 9:41, app was showing on the way, but suddenly it changed to order waiting at door.",2
"This is a stupid app. When I search anything to order it only shows that "" No results found """,1
"The CC over chat behaved very transactional. Rather than doing something in the given situation that would have been a win win, all he could do was refund",3
This is realy nice but delivery charges is very high,4
Its a food delivery company but they didn't know the custemor real time issues if you got some problem in food they didn't take food back and bring new one on real time they just chat for a while and didn't reply for hour they didn't care of your hunger you can only throw that food and if you have got some extra money you have to order again no replacement no guarantee,2
Always fast and prompt delivery..Highly appreciable . Best wishes to Zomato and its team for their services in this pandemic .Way to Go👍 Happy Customer. 🥰,5
Very bad.. Not even worth 1star..i am waiting for refund over a month They do not have any customer service number Only auto generated messages to your complaint,1
"Provide 3rd class services, order never comes on time. There is no way to contact Zomato to complaint. Also, there is no way to get your money back. Also, your live tracking is fraud.",1
"Other than the bad ( no delivery even after payment) experience with Hong Kong Express restaurant, haven't had any other hiccups with the app and restaurants promoted by Zomato!!",5
The first experience is very good the food and the quality of food is ver nice the delevirey boy is also polite,5
"Zomato servive in Purulia is so disgusting. I have ordered food at 10:05PM and on 10:45 PM when all delivery services close to accept order they notify me that order is cancelled due to unavailbilty of valet. Guys When order was accepted by restaurant and after 10 min when there is no valet assigned, why you guys not cancelled my order. Now I have no food and no option for any type of order. Disgusting Zomato team.",1
Delivery is very slow.. They charge higher then resto.. Its better to order directly from resto. Membership charges are so high..,1
Delivery valet live location on map is inaccurate.,1
Some users are not able to use cash on delivery option on same restaurants while some users can. Please look into the matter and resolve my issue.,2
Worst experienced from zomato! I've waited for 3 hours and the driver deliver my food on my old address! He didn't checked the new one. Item was paid already and sadly my money was gone! Poor service!,1
Very bad service. The guys are not answerable to anyone. There is no system to escalate your problems. They just stonewall you with executive chats which never go through.,1
Very helpful late night orders social distancing easy cancellation,5
They debited 238rs from my bank account without my knowledge I don't know how is it possible and no reply from their support team. I lost my 238 rs by them and I think same happened for many,1
I know having fever is a red signal but what about hypothermia? I've seen multiple riders with body temp below 95f which can be fatal. Is the instrument proper? Are you taking temp properly or is the rider really suffering from hypothermia or some similar cold condition? The Biryani Life from Ola Foods boasts temperature of people working there (in the image uploaded by them) as low as 87f. Please check on this.,2
I always see 2 menu all restaurant.There is no menu but why?,2
zomato is very genuine app ever its service is just incredile they are always ready to here you and as per my experience all the delivery persons i met are very polite and humple sometimes i might have given bad review to food but never to delivery boy they are always good,4
Loved the app. UI can be improved.,5
Very Very bad service!!!!! Delivery guy did not deliver but app is showing as delivered!!! No one in Chat responds to solve the issue!!! On top I paid for their premium services!!! Cheats!!!! Zomato zomato - rotten tomato,1
"This place is great! Atmosphere is chill and cool but the staff is also really friendly. They know what they’re doing and what they’re talking about, and you can tell making the customers happy is their main priority . Love the south indian food dosas and utapam",5
Very happy with Zomato's fast service.,5
Horriable experience.... Food order not delivered and marked as delivered.. no option to call delivery boy after delivered message and chat with zoomato is not working,1
"App shows offer eligible while selecting food, but during payment it says invalid offer. Horrible experience after identifying and resolving selecting right food. Won't use Zomato any more",2
sick app. incompetent to the core...don't subscribe Zomato PRO it is useless money loot no benefits as just lists already available discounts and coupons mor visibly...go for swing super it gets you free delivery lot of savings.,1
"Zomato has become very profit minded and the offers given are not real.they give 15rs or something off and collect more as taxes and delivery charge..While most restaurants has free home delivery,it is not wise to rely upon this Profit-Minded App....Uninstalling.",1
"Getting expensive each passing day. Offers and discounts are not like before, they are washing away into other charges.",3
"Ordered food , after waiting for almost 1 hour I tried reaching out to the delivery guy who di d not pickup call and then he marked my prepaid order delivered. It took me 30 mins to reach customer care and they said they have delivered food which I never received. Highly disappointed with Zomato. Now I feel the video that went viral about eating food by zomato delivery valet on the way to delivery was absolutely right. Do not place prepaid order on Zomato.",1
Worst service. Everytime it is showing due to high demand place order above some value. Then what about those guys who eat less than that value of food.,1
Not able to change address not user friendly ..I don't know what the back end team is doing ... They eat sheet and sleep.,1
App is good no issue about it. But improve your GPS tracking. It has worst tracking as compared to Swiggy and Uber Eats.,3
"Zomato just started their operations in Calicut and while they do face intense competition from the likes of Swiggy and Potafo, there are faring well. A small downside would be a lack of restaurants who are on Zomato (including Gold ones) which makes me switch to either of aforementioned services",5
The hotel's listed are not good enough to provide good quality food. And they should not listed ice cream times if they can not deliver the ice cream properly,1
"Its very fast and on time,good food quality by restaurant,humble employe and time to time delivery...",5
"I ordered pizza in ovenstory pizza at6.27pm and at 8.30pm I got a result that my order as canceled,,,I made my payment also ,,they are telling that my payment will be transferred to my bank account with in 7 working days,,,up to April 6 all Bank is holiday so I want to wait for 14 days ,,so people who are having zomato app pls delete it,,,pls don't wait for 14days to eat ur pizza and don't order it in ovenstory pizza",1
"No tamper proof packaging even after charging hefty amounts as delivery charges. Rude delivery executives. Even rude customer service, which never really resolved any issues.",2
"Kulcha king team, once again you made my day. I was feeling bored at home and decided to go there to have dinner..this time I had all together an amazing food experience. Being honest kulcha comes with so many complimentary things and everything was super tasty 😋.. while waiting I got starters and the best thing was when I was about to go staff came with free pani Puri and initially I thought It wouldn't be tasty but I was wrong and it was so damn good that changed my mind for pani Puri.😋👌",5
You are really excellent Zomato I really like your services I think that from now I will go with Zomato only because Zomato is just great great and great thank you for doing this nice job for us because it's really very difficult to find out a nice 5 star restaurant but you give us a nice product with from taken from a five star restaurant really a big big big thank you and I think that you will do this great job till the end of the world thank you Zomato,5
After using many months later its not show properly the restaurant near you.even once i ordered from those restaurant also...later its shows nothing.. app problem.. 👎,1
Food is the priority for which we all work. Zomato is serving us even the situation is pandemic I really appreciate It and we all should. Thank 👍🏼,5
"Had a good experience, however the adress of The restaurant i.e Murlidhar Dairy Farm was not shown correct in app in place of M.G.ROAD, it incorrectly wrote Talav Gate. Pl correct it.",5
The Customer service team lie to you about their riders being late and blaming it on the restaurant. They think everyone is senseless. The delay in receiving order is just increasing and they don't want to compensate you anymore. Very disappointed recently.,2
Very nice experience... minute to minute updates on order being placed. ..always coupons are available .keep up great work,5
Delivery is fast and on time. Never faced any kind of issues such as delay or any food related issues.,5
Notat all user friendly service...why this new version have to order minimum order R. Why????there no less surcharge for delivering as it's,2
It was really good. ...but now its gone worsen to worsen...non of the containers r sealed...whenever i receive my foods...its always in a mess...,5
delivery charges & taxes have to be a bit lesser..😶,3
"Works well, clean UI. Delivering within an acceptable time limit else they refund the order amount. Works a lot better then swiggy at any time.",5
Lot of restaurant choices compared to other similar apps. User friendly App and some discounts will be there which can be applied...,5
Don't install this app. The restaurant owners cheat customers with the support of zomato. If we complaint about problems of food zomato purposefully remove 'connect an agent option'. Then they not respond or take proper action to our mails.When i complaints about food i can't see connect an agent option.,1
Continuously...items are missing from my orders. when I went to intimate the Zomato they came back with the Zomato credits instead of refund....maybe this is also a strategy to run the business...great....,1
Nice food delivery App. Safe in covid situation As well as with less restrictions like payment method.,4
Very poor as I was not able to explore complete menu of my favourite restaurant and had to satisfy by repeating my previous order. It has happened second time.,2
Whenever we need to complain on the app it gets technical glitch error and we are not able to do anything.,1
wonderful ambience. Outstanding taste. Definitely would come back once every week or 2. Wonderful service too. Kudoos to the team at kebapci for running such a grade A restaurant.,5
I ordered a food in a hotel which provides buy one get one free.but I didn't receive the free food..after escalate to concern team and after one hour struggle I get the money for the free one which means half of the food price and that too not as valet balance it's just a promo code..the biggest thing here is already hotels here providing more than a promo I got which I can't use.....At the end of the day one of my family member is going to bed with empty stomach because of zomato.Great service.,1
"Worst service Expected time shown is mostly incorrect, the valet are rarely able to understand location. Price is high.",1
"Delivery time is too high Most of the time getting worst food like (basi) one day old,,, and please it's really true please improve on that",1
"Have been using Zomato for a long time and became regular on a day to day usage. So far so good, keep up the good work. Thanks.",5
App expirience is so out standing and fast delivery,5
My Pro cancelled after activated. I was checking refund policy. It mentioned 200rs return for cancel. Then immediately it says no refund. Why would I cancel if it mentioned no refund for canceling? Really felt cheated zomato. Please do the needful.,1
Very bad app. Charges too high delivery fees. And charges taxes which ultimately goes in zomato's pocket only. Dont recommend it at all. Swiggy is way better. Uninstalling ri8 away🤢🤬😡,1
"When cash on delivery is needed the option is only not available , the app is just not useful when needed ,service is also very late 👎🏻",1
Now days Zomato service is horrible and today I have received open food package in this Covid scenario. Such a waste of time and money and the nice part is refund will take 4-7 days as per their updation.,1
Worst app ever to order as they cabt even fetch location and can argue on it so that the delivery boy could get free food,1
"Now they are looting ........Charging extra at every step means while you book any meal, then in the name of peak hours, then distance after that delivery charge.",1
They wont respond properly though few items are missing. They will ask us to write they wont respond properly. waste of giving even 1 star also,1
Have village like setting. food is fine. staff is good. Toilets need improvement. Nice setup but needing deep cleaning 👍,3
Zomato is a bad app don't order form here. If somehow you want to cancel your order zomato will take 50% penalty charge. Don't order from zomato😠😠😠,1
"Fast, easy, wide range of hotels. 👏👍",5
"You need to update you customer service sector. I cannot text the things that I want to, this creates a communication problem. This is severely disappointing.",3
Pathetic app. They ask their valets to deliver multiple orders at the same time and by the time you get your food it is cold. Useless app,1
1n half hour delay Can u understand when your waiting time before ordering shows 30 mins and u don't get your order even after 2 hours. What does zomato people think that we dont have other plans or work which gets delayed due to your laziness. Zomato getting worse day by day. Totally frustrated n unsatisfied.,1
Waste of time and also money. I ordered some food. But it was uncooked and also unfresh. Please don't buy any food from here. Also the customer service is very bad. They don't help you with your meal.,1
Delivery was on time...very good service!,4
"If they are sending wrong food or damage one still they are like we need a proof. I ordered something from subway and it was gift for someone and it was all spilled and they were like provide picture, I told them as it was a gift and because of that condition he thrown it in Dustbin straight away. This is not 1st time",1
My order arrived late twice continuously.. Zomato is getting so poor that they make their valet deliver 2-3 orders at a time. Instead of 30 mins my order reached me at after an hour. Food was completely cold,2
Customer support is very responsive and they do everything they can. I'm so grateful for the service. Thank you!,5
I have been using this app for 2 yrs now but recently I m been facing some quality issues with services as delivery are getting late quite often.,3
USELESS This app used to be somewhat nice earlier but now it has begun to ignore the issues raised the customers. One of the Zomato valet behaved with anger while he was delivering the order telling me that I should order from some nearby restaurant as it becomes too far for him to deliver at my place.,1
"Minimal contact on delivery, polite and professional service. Values customer and providing super good offers. Keep up the good work.😊",5
Quality of food was very bad.. Zomato people admitted this but didn't come with any proper solution... They should be some resolution... Expecting some solution from Zomato service.,1
"You need to work on your deliveries reliability, 90% of your drivers have location issues, I've never received my orders on time, your customer services team is completely useless btw!",1
Very slow service had to wait almost an hour for my order to arrive from a near by restaurant They can consider making delivery service quick,2
"Time for delivery is always wrong. It shows may be 10 mins..and after 5 mins, it becomes 9 mins remaining.. waste app",2
"Worst app ever, it hangs and they dont call you back when orders are cancelled and there chat people cant solve anything they just apologize!",1
Very pathetic slow hard to get response customer care compared to swiggy. Their choice of shops too are now a days pathetic. Their delivery boys are so shabby dressed . Thou most of them wear masks they are rarely seen in ZOMATO uniform. This is my concern from trivandrum. Heard in news about unruly behaviour of ZOMATO delivery boys. Is it happening here to or going to happen. I reccomend you stop using ZOMATO,1
Awesome service . Super fast delivery,5
I ordered and after it just called the restaurant to cancel the order and still I tried to coordinate with them so that they don't have to waste time for anything still delivery boy called me I again told him whole scenerio he said okay and then zomoto and thus restaurant doesn't care what are they actually look like with this behavior that they are just sitting there and accepting orders no solution for customers issues nothing they just want earn it that's all.Better we cook at home and eat.,1
Disappointing app not able to delever food at my place so why it shows the places to which we can order food at some particular time i can't understand it,1
Worst app.They dont refund money when order not receive after 1.5 hours on 26 December. They just want your money!!They have no cash on delivery mode and no Zomato easy option.,1
"i found it very useful,because whenever i feel hungry then i can quickly oder my favorite food, its doesn't matter where am i.",5
"Dear zomato, Day by day your service is really going down. Last two times I ordered food from your apps.. 1st I received Cold drinks seal open and half bottle finished.. Next time I didn’t received salads and I paid for it. Thank you and improve your Service.",1
The restaurants in this apps are servings a bad quality of food even if u give them instructions also but they won't cook like write in your instructions they just pack that food that they already made since morning... n when I asked Zomato that please replace this order they said that I'm sorry ur facing these type of problem and they said that if u order next they will serve me good food. iaid if u can't replace it then refund my amount and they said that I'm sorry they can't do that.😠😠😠😠,1
Like nearby restaurants suggestions. Offers also good,5
Very good service our order always came on time .Very efficient staff keep it up !!,5
We had very bad experience for the orders delivererd. 1)Order servered was incorrect and 2) delivered status was updated even before delivering the orders. What a service fr Zomato.,1
Restaurants show pics of delicious dishes but send different items not worth eating. Last night i order Kentucky chicken image of which like KFC crispy chicken legs but they delivered chicken pakode fried in like burnt oil. So disappointing.,1
Very worst app. Doesn't treat the customer properly. Quality of food is very bad. Don't waste your money in zomato.,1
Previously i was using some other food delivery app. But after using Zomato I had a very good service experience. Offers and safety concerns are first priority of Zomato. Six stars to Zomato,5
"App is good but the tax, distance fee, handling charges are too high.",1
Not at all discipline. They will revise the timeline of delivery to make your breakfast into a lunch. Please remember this.,1
Awesome app which is helpful during this pendamic .. great initiative 🙌,5
"Unable to order using app, chat done ppl just passing me from one agent to other, told me to send mail. Useless support system.",1
Reasanable charge for other delivery app compared to this,4
1st review :- Pathetic customer service in app also I can say nothing customer service. 2nd review:- I'm editing my review after getting assistant from customer service by Email and they solved my problem but there is many things to improve. But for now I'm changing review bcz of there response.,3
"Very good experience, timely delivery.",5
So a restaurant took the whole money for a order and just sent the half order. I talked to the restaurant they said that they're gonna send the other remaining tomorrow so I waited but they didn't I complained to zomato they're not even solving my issue all they ask for the pictures....the restaurant confirmed itself that's it's their fault but zomato doesn't help their customers So disappointing in you ZOMATO Worst app ever,1
No customer care support Even delivery late it Time freeze in 3 minutes If i give report about quality and quantity issues just asking sorry Double the rate than offline if you have doubt Feel free to check anywhere I won't suggest this to anyone,1
"Pathetic. The Zomato pro membership is scam, there are barely any changes to the amount saved when ordering from the very few list of restaurants that are eligible for pro members. And the food takes way too long to get delivered inspite of being a pro member. The chat assistant is terrible, they take forever to even respond back to you.",1
Horrible and pathetic service. The automatic customer service is horrible and tere is no proper tracking of my order. My order is 2 hours late. Zomato can't believe such horrible and worst services,1
"Watch their timings, they ahow 20 minutes in their app whereas they took more time in real 40 min approx",2
"i ordered my meal around at 1 am and now its almost 3am and still I am waiting for my meal to be delivered. this is pathetic. don't play with customers emotions, money and hunger in this tough situation.",1
"Today i order food at 2.20 pm but my order not delivered, but i got a msg of delivery, when i call, rider no is switched off why zomato has not any service number For there customer Many time many customers face online fraud due to this, i think to loadge a consumer case in consumer court",1
Experience is excellent A suggestion would be to add feature of ordering in advance and also multiple ordering from various restaurants at the same time..,5
"I really wanted to give feedback to Zomato. As they don't think about their employees working for them. Those who are trying to take Zomato on height. They actually don't investigate , if someone is complaining about any of the employee of Zomato They simply ask that employee to leave! Such a bad thing about Zomato. Not gonna order again from Zomato.",1
Yes!! This app 'zomato' is useful for me.,4
"good app but it keeps getting bugs for finding the exact location, user interface could be a little more simpler",4
Zomato is good in terms of Restaurant chains and delivery services as well. Keep it up!,5
I like Zomato service but Zomato should check the quality of food also.,5
I gave correct address but it shown some other location to the delivery boy,1
Nice .. easy to order and user friendly,5
Chat options for resolutions have no response time limit it's a waste of time agent called Asif didn't respond for the longest time,1
Useless app with No standard. Do not follow the time for Delivery for cusyomer.,1
Good tracking the food delivered very fast,5
"The chat person does not respond..even after waiting for 15 min. No way to followup. I have the snapshot but unfortunately noway to post here...I have been asking chat person ...he came- asked my issue but neither he provided resolution, nor he reverted back...its almost 20 min now.",1
Zomato should add restaurant. Which only has minimum 4 star rates. According to taste. Some restaurants so poor. Totally mood-off from that.,3
Worst my order was cancelled and I didn't knew about that called restaurant order was ready but no delivery partner was assigned and while raising query was informed that my order is cancelled very bad service and long waiting time....,1
My cake delivery was spoiled. Only one cake. The other one was good. But Zomato handled the complaint and closed it immediately. They refunded me as well. Issue resolution was great.,5
"Shows inflated prices(prices in restaurants are twenty to thirty rupees lower including taxes), I don't know why zomato does this which discourages from buying from here plus delivery charges even from free delivery restaurants why would I buy from this app then? Plus they expect(guilt trip)people to tip the rider?",2
"zomoto is promising 30 mins or free delivery.. its fake.. even though food delivered after 30 mins, app captures time before 30 mins as delivery time.. customer care idiots will blindly follow the time showing in the app",1
"Great! It works very well, and even displays fun facts about food while loading.",5
"Received most distrubed food. Chat support is not supporting at all. You order food, received waste and you have wasted your money. Zomato only offer half of the price og your order. Total wastage",1
Very poor service we lost our money. And there is no response from authorized person. The customer service sucks.... They are not giving any answer for our queries.,1
"Very bad experience, cancelling the food after 1.5 hours of wait, between no cordination btw Zomato and delivery team, and u end up not getting Ur food as restaurant is closed. It's been a joke now for me , Zomato .",1
The delivery charge is sometimes way too high to afford otherwise I would have rated it with 5 stars. Nice app.,4
Whatever discount coupon is applicable to an order should be applied automatically. Otherwise it is plain robbery.,2
Order pizaa from Zomato. Its 1:30 min. Still waiting for pizza. impressed with Zomato service. Well done. If you ask for support from support executive you don't think you will get any support from them.,1
The app is failing to load miserably. From one step to the next the loading time is so frustrating. Utterly annoying,3
No proper support while addressing the issue...and very robotic approach while dealing with issues faced by the customer.,2
Always charging my card but order will get cancelled know minutes after being charged then I have to follow up on reversal of the charged amount...not cool,1
Pathetic customer service. Pro discount didn't get applied to my order. Was never helped. They kept transferring the chat and made a mockery of the conversation,1
zomato is the worst app for online ordering. They don't resolve our issue. They apply delivery and tax charge more than anyy other app. Scam offers. My cash on delivery option is disabled from 2 yeara i dont know whyy. Such a disappointing app.,1
The basic to do of checking the order while pickup is arranged at restaurant is missing... pathetic service quality 🙄 received wrong order twice in last 2 days.,1
Zomato pro is terrible. Just get Swiggy super instead. So to give more context Zomato pro implied that pro would not have delivery charge anymore but that's just not true while Swiggy super does that and is just better in general.,1
Super delay in the arrival of the order even after the valet leaving the restaurant as scheduled. The valet didn't pick up the call twice and responded at the 3rd instance saying he was away delivering another order.,1
"Zomato service is getting worse by the day. Waited more than 1 hour, still the delivery guy could not find my location.",1
"Money sucking apps...do u guys think we are idiots... all menus price are higher than actual than packing charges, delivery charges, tax, surge charges....seriously sucks",1
"Superb delivery by zomato... very quick , as per the time they delivered it and also the application was very easy to use as compared to others",5
"Very poor service, delivery guys work in parallel with Swiggy, Dunzo. They wait for more than one orders and then leave their location... It's been multiple times",1
Good for food it's hot 🔥🔥 and delivery in just 45 minutes,5
"Hotels cheat on their customers in the name of discounts and even we report this to the customer support,they don't help at all. Pathetic experience of food ordering and even worse customer service. Better try swiggy if you want your hotel food experience to be good.",1
No option to cancel the order even if cancellation is done within a few minutes. This is unfair and monopolistic.,1
The delivery will be very late....nearly 1 hour 30mins taking for one delivery....If any people are hungry and they book a food then they should eat after 2 hours ...such a worst,1
"No proper service, no proper suggestions, they dont even know how to cancel a order, if any customer wants to cancel a order. We know we ordered a order, if we want to cancel that order, they are not even properly guiding us. What is this nonsense service, we are a good customer of zomato, so please give us suggestion as soon as possible.",1
Support system is good.sometimes vendors send wrong items but Zomato support system never let u down. They reimburse properly and understand the problem.,5
Quick delivery.Customer safety is also taken.Social distancing us also practiced. Nice app👍,4
"I am very much satisfied as because Zomato is friendly and any problem, if bring to the notice of Zomato, they solve it whole-heartedly. Thanks Zomato",5
There is an big difference in rate list of hotel or restaurant which is less and Zomato rate list is more even though the Zomato incueds extra delivery charges.,1
"Delivery timings are too late more than one hour, as usual there is no proper support.",1
"It was exceptional experience placing order through Zomato,best part is the quick dilivery time. It was augmenting experience.",5
3rd time in a week after so many disappointing incidents I'm deleting the app. Latest experience - The worst food delivery app where they lie to you about your food getting delivered at 11 PM. They stall you for 90 mins and push you to accept the order even after you have cancelled it....I wish they allow here to post screenshot.,1
"Not respomding for any of refunding. They are not responding for food poisining, while i experienced on two times. Too much time taking to delivered the food when angry than compared to swiggy",1
Good app simple procedure of placing order and have more options for easy delivery like we can record the audio for telling the directions to reach the address.... Best app!,5
Every time cashback regards issue. And not give answer proper. I have aslo send mail about my query till not received any satisfied response.,1
"Today I ordered. I went to sleep and could not attend the call from the delivey guy and when I called him, he 1st said that he delivered at reception, in 2nd call, he said he delivered it outside my room 301, Asoka lodge. In 3rd call he said he delivered in Asoka lodge near Gurudwara. When I reached ashoka near Gurudwara, came to know he never kept food parcel to any of the hotels. Till this time he lied told and said he delivered. Please do not lie to ur customer. Zomate has initiated refund.",1
Nice and fresh food on time delivery!,5
Zomato servicing should improve in terms of delivery when we order ice creams it comes to us in melting position and sometimes food is also cold so improve your time limit and make sure that we have ordered ice cream not water and food should be warm for pleasent experience,3
I have ordered Pasta from Millennium restaurant at late night and they have delivered uncooked simply boiled pasta. And even this restaurant number is not reachable. Worst experience ever with zomato.,1
Great service All precautions are taken during covid-19 Delivery was excellent No backdrops,5
In love with this app. This is more useful than any other online food site. Coupon codes are very much useful. Thanks again.,5
No help or action taken by zomato for any kind of rude behavior or delay from the valets side and even worse is the chat with the customer support with only sends computerized replies and not being helpful at all what so ever.,1
Bad impression on zomato I have paid for the order but the app is showing that transaction failed what is this??? Very bad,1
"App and delivery persons very good. Found Food not so good sometimes, but that's the restaurant we choose.",4
Easy to access. Easily gets all known restaurants with good offers. Better than swiggy app. Always gives Discount on every orders.,5
Great app for ordering food online.. good discounts and variety of Restaurants to choose from..,5
"In the last 8 weeks three times I've received my order at least 30 minutes late and when I called for following the same thing it's been told we are sorry, I think if you providing a delivery services either You deliver on time or don't give promises you can't deliver",1
This aapp is the wrost app. I ordered cake and their delivery man went to wrong location they cancelled my order and even not refunding me my amount that to they people arguing me blaming me i kept wrong location .Their delivery service is wrost always and if it is my hand they would have give zero rating,1
It does not get gps location correctly and had to go and get from the nearby square because of faulty location that this app takes,3
Awful customer service. Raised same complaint multime times they always say support executive will get back to you in less than 3 mins but no one calls. Zomato is getting worst.,1
It's a worst food delivery app. The taxes and charges are very high. Even pro membership is useless. Swiggy is much better than this. 👎👎👎👎,1
The delivery guys r given multiple pickups at the same time which creates a lot of delay in delivery then why r u charging service charges,1
Pro membership is just a trap... Most of the pro outlets are really bad... Will never go to inreal world if u knew .. have seen a real bad outlet of our area listed as pro . It seems to be a way to get business for them since no one inarea visit them in real world,1
I ordered from Mc Donald's and in the ordered i recieved few items were missing and i contacted the support. They said that the amount will be refunded in 4-5 days and it has already been 9 days and now if i contact the support executive they are asking for 4-5 days. Guys i'm not asking to eat freely. I am asking to return the amount which i have paid to the items which I haven't received,1
Today was my first order but was very nice experience..delivery on time decent delivery men 👌,5
Very poor customer service. No option to chat properly.predefined options r there. My order is delayed and no proper answer .,1
"Delivery guys are so rude every time. They Dont consider time. They just want to accept order wherever the order is. I hope zomato is taking action against low rating delivery guys. Also zomato kitchen is worst, zomato kitchen has tie up with some restaurants and makes food if there is rush at hotel.",1
I've had good offers on this app. I love this app. The services are also good but delivery time could be lesser.,4
"Good one, deserve better ratings from people.. nearly ordered more than 10 times.. everytime.. got delivered food before 5-10 mins of delivery time estimated.. hate that tax and delivery charges.. happy to tip rider..",5
Most of the valets don't deliver food. They just accept then turn off their mobile phones and we had to wait for 2.5 hrs for just the delivery from a 5km restaurant.,1
"One complaint regarding fetching the correct location, even after providing exact address, the valet is unable to reach me. Faced this several times",5
"Delivery charge high , Number of resturants with pro(subscription) is less And when ordering from other resturants , the delivery charges are way too high Make delivery free People with Zomato Pro subscription.",1
"Zomato.. are you guys serious about customer service and experience? Although I selected the delivery option as 'Hand me the order', the valet still just hung the order at the gate. And marked the order as delivered. Is it really delivered? Refunding the amount and providing a voucher is not always the solution. It's the moments of life, special occasions that get spoiled, because of the insensitive behavior of your valet.",1
For the last 3 orders I've been facing the same issue that delory boy's phone is switched off when I try to connect. Your delivery services are worst. Truly wors t,1
Zomoto collects too much for membership charge but the hotels and offers are worst.waste of taking yearly membership. Zomato makes the food too expensive and offers discount on that showing that they are giving best offer.,1
The outlets on Zomato are not providing food as per expectations. Even after complaint there is no proper resolution of the issue.,2
All srevice is good but delivery charges is very high,3
It's been more than 35 days that am following up with their customer care (chats & emails) for 180rs refund. They kept forwarding to different teams and now for past 10 days they stopped replying also. Pathetic service.,1
"The app became super slow and laggy to the extent that its so annoying and the prices and delivery charges are just as bad, no longer want to use your application anymore as i have no more patience to handle it.",1
Zomato is Useless app ....swiggy is better than this Zomato app ...reason why Zomato is not good if you are facing any issues with your food they will do nothing and it delivers always late and there is nothing to tell good about Zomato.,1
You should also add places which take an hour to deliver like from my area McDonald's is 40mins they can still deliver even if it takes an hour to deliver we alreaey pay delivery charges anyway.,3
"It's always nice.. Nice Food, Multiple restaurants.. Daily Offers... Good Service.. Co operative workers.. And I hope Good customer service as well but still not required at all.",5
I'm more satisfied about the Service... I'm ordering for more than 3 years and I haven't had a late delivery even one time... Loving this App....,5
I ordered food which was cancelled by zomato just bcz my phn was not reachable but i had provided detailed address.. after cancellation i reordered the same thing which was delivered without even calling me. so if they could deliver without even cqlling why did they cancelled my 1st order... now they are not refunding my money.. thet caused my family to stay hungry for 2 hrs... their delivery person literally stole my food and they are charging the cost on me.. their customer service is bad..,1
"Wastage of money,we ordered two different flavours but both had same taste...not worth of money.",1
"Zomato has the worst customer care among all online platforms. They charge insane amount for delivery, their coupon codes are just gimmicks and the food quality is average and sometimes the food quality is so bad that you have to throw away your entire order.",1
"To much of delivery cost collected from my location, and limited offers and less restaurants in my place other application show so many restaurants but here very less and delivery price is high more than 60 rs",3
"Zomato app is a completely useless app, at 2:00 pm the order will come at 3:00 pm and we will collect the tax separately from the delivery charge but the service is completely useless... It's better we have go to hotel pick our own order... Zomato become worst..why we are pay tax or delivery charge",1
"Good fooding app, easy to search and navigate. Timely food delivery, always good experience.",5
"Ordered twice and Never delivered on time and operations are too worst,even after delivered also it's showing the state as your food is on the way",1
"I use Zomato daily. However when I placed an order by mistake and in less than 2 mins communicated to them, they agreed to cancel on the condition COD will be disabled. Any company that doesn't make exceptions for daily customers.... no words. I'm changing over to Swiggy.",2
"Charges taxes a lot, the menu shows rates with discount but while placing order it doesnt show any discount and taxes are just too much",1
But don't go for visa single click enabling worst thing I have seen.Badly ordered item by accidentally. Very bad experience with this app.,1
Really amazing aap easy to choose food anywhere anytime I love this aap😍😍😍😍,5
"There is a glitch with payment process. I did payment, but the order was not placed.😡😡. Such a worst app.",1
I Always rely on this app for my food cravings... All over good one for all cravings u have.. Wish we could have more discounts option for the same,5
I oredered the food using zomato. Its a wonderfull food delivery app.,4
"Ordered burger nearby my house, delivery time was taking 1 hour ?? Restaurants are maintaining accuracy so is Zomato",1
They rip you off under the name of learning as they didn't deliver the instructions to restaurants. They also wont offer full refund for the messed up order.,1
I am a zomato rider.. As zomato doesn't pay properly.. I feel it's cheating the riders.. Distance pay doesn't pay correctly.. I have raised 5 queries from past one month for distance pay.. They still didn't resolve it.. Very bad support zomato has.. And some time I travel more to deliver.. But they pay less.. Very bad guys work here as support they are always rude...,1
I am using the app everyday. It has started lagging from couple of days..Bad experience from last 3 days.,1
Rating downgraded to 2. Live status tracking is an illusion. A burger is prepared for 30 minutes. ETA remains 21 minutes for next 18 minutes.,2
O points bad experience order given before 1 hour and stil times showing 27 minutes.... Still no cal or any massage came yet... Bad experience. I suggest dnt order anything on this app,1
"Applied promo code on at the time of payment and it applied and showed discount of 29 and another discount for single payment upto 40 also not giving but the amount debit was without discount, if pro member face this kind of experience so what about others.",2
Worst customer service experience. I really hate this app. Doesn't filter as per requirements. I have to say lot about this zomato service but I don't want waste my time in writing.,1
"Excellent application and easy to use, the delivery is fast.",5
No delivery near me although i live in a place where the food can be easily delivered but this app is not showing any dilevery near me.,1
"Worst app these apps give multi order delivery to delivery guys, I received an order just from 3 kms in 1.5 hour",1
Easy to place orders. But now taxes and shipping costs are almost 20% of net price of items.,3
"I ordered an item in a wrong address once by mistake,... But after i cancelled the order, they refused to refund the money which i paid before.... Their customer care refused to deliver the order beyond 5km and told me to talk with the delivery boy... Even after I requested the delivery boy to deliver the food and that I'll give some extra to come beyond 5km, they refused.. I wasted my hard earned money... I will never use such apps again",1
Worst delivery service...if you have placed an order you have to bear with them...they might cancel your order after an hour of waiting with silly reasons...I had a bad experience with Zomato,1
Very bad service. App showing restaurant online accepting order but after sum time of ordering food restaurant call and says restaurant is closed very very bad service,1
Extra charges and min order and delivery time.. all are poor,1
Very good service n deliveryman is full in manner. Love zomato,5
I have logged in with a new number. But I didn't get 1st order offer upto 60%. It's a new number.,1
This app is charging soo much.. serge charge delivery charge. And texes.. That's not fare.. if pizza is 100 with aal the charges it raises to 190 or above..,1
Worst experience whenever i have to order something they just give 2x delivery charges..........no chat support same templates get repeated and very bad experience... utterly disappointed,2
Very bad experience .food was late by 1 hour that than the expected time... So bad,1
"For one incident don't make lose in business by giving timing if they hv not delivered on time ua offering for free. This is too risk for zomato might get lose in the business. I felt sad due to one issue ua giving offers like this. Business prospective, I don't feel this is the right decision. I hope u ll change this option. That's ok we ll wait if they deliver late. We can also understand there condition. Zomato is doing great. Change the decisions according to the business prospective wise.",5
"Amazing experience from zomato,but the price only too high",5
If you get into issues wrt delivery of your order...be assured you'll not get any help from zomato as their customer care team is as good as their chatbots. You'll keep getting standard responses but no refunds!,1
Nice app with very good delivery on time with polite attitude..,5
awesome app.. perfect experience of selecting the food/restaurants/cuisines ... checking ratings.. very intuitive interface.. worthy of 5 stars. .,5
"Doing great service , sometimes problems occurs like different food I know it's because of particular restaurant from zomato I'm satisfied 100%",5
Whenever I order from this place it's showing the wrong location for the delivery. From other places all coming to me without any issues..,4
Zomato is not providing a good service if the restaurent not accepted the order they will not refund if you pay online totally fraud people from the beginning since my 3 order should be refunded still I am not get anything instead they will give a rrn number if we check that number with bank the bank says there is no refunds received on Ur card totally Zomato is fraud FRAUD FRAUD BE CAREFULL EVERY ONE. also they cant deliver the food on time and they are not haveing the best restaurants,1
Good it's a useful app 😊 I enjoyed it .this app is very useful for foodies And jobers,4
"To all the restaurants out there, for a takeaway order if you give less quantity or even give an empty box to the customer, Zomato will not do anything about it, because it is not in their system to compensate. So anyone wants to use this loophole they are free to. Thank you Zomato for such an amazing service and brilliant loopholes to help the restaurants at the expense of customer's money.",1
Good food ordering app. Always provides great discounts and offers. Live tracking could be a bit accurate,5
Very fast service and Enough choices for Tasty food,5
Great way to order food. Easy to use. Easy to rate restaurants best application to order food online thank you,5
"Quite a lot of paid reviews on Zomato. Degraded performance parameters. Many paid reviews it seems while going through profiles. The same person reviews a restaurant for Delhi, then Goa and Bhopal. Another one of the same restaurant at multiple outlets. How does Zomato even let them thrive while letting restaurants influence ratings? Bizzare",1
Its an amazing app which has almost every restaurant i require,5
Bad very bad. They charge for service but there service is very poor. Besides you charge extra on menu items too...,1
"in big metros the offers are great Soni's the food, in a small town like kochi the food, especially veg food is horrible. Zomato should push for better food quality.",3
"Very pathetic service.even if you will have genuine issues,customer support executive will not ready to listen.",1
"I liked it, yeah it was few minutes late but I guess it's not an issue as they are humans too. I enjoyed my food 😋 and the price was not too high, it was in my budget.",5
All your listings are becoming expensive plus offers are sometimes not there. Paying 1000 or 2000 for food is kind unrealistic like if you wanna order daily or alternate. Indian food delivery companies have become greedy,1
Love the app. Only thing is can't able to track the delivery man. After I got delivery tracking is updating,4
"Very worst 👎 in many of my orders many items were missing and there is no proper response when I reported it, it was just waste of money and a big disappointment",1
I love chicken kabab Visited kothanur kitchen for my dinner.. I got to taste kothu parotha with sherwa the very first time. It tasted like egg burji for me. It is heavy and filler.. best for larger groups.,5
"I am on zomato platform since 2011, earlier i use the app to get info about nearby restaurants, since than it really grown and best app in compitition.",5
"Too high rates, not affordable like uber. Missing uber. Even delivery charges are high. Just fooling ppl",2
Very very very satisfied I have a no word to explain this app greatness.,5
I am very impressed by their customer support.I recieved stale and uncooked food as a result i raised a complained regarding it and they resolved it within minutes....i m really impressed...lots of love and keep it up,5
Delivery Tracking UI needs to improve.,4
delivery late and using first order discount 60%but you have to minimum order rupees 250 that can be possible for order so not like worst,2
We can't order two order at one time.... It seems tale only from only one restaurant not acceptable at all 🙄,2
Worst app. I am going to unistall this app right now. The customer care executives are useless. They never care for customer or their money. It is more frustrating when you are hungry.,1
Very heavy and fast ordering Zomato I liked very much,5
Excellent service and fast deliveries,5
"Worst👎experience, first and last order, only show promo code before booking but not apply at least on first order",1
Great app and instant response on queries.,5
"no timely delivery, the rider will collect the order and rome around the city and no one keeps check on him. the riders are quiet absent minded to follow the delivery instructions.",1
Too much delivery charges otherwise i Dont have any complain and i dont have any bad experience !! This is very convenient for me,4
The customer support sucks big time. They make you wait for a good 15 mins to even acknowledge your chat.,1
"Zomoto is the worst, they are really bad at refunding for your order. Mine refund has not arrived in 40 days.",1
I have ordered many times from Snack Shack and the food has always been flavourful and very delicious. The quantity is really good. I am a fan.,5
Very Very Bad Service.... and if u paid via online before delivery so now your money was lost you paid 2nd time via cod it's very bad exprience and I requst you come to swiggy its really good and cool app for food delivery,1
Smart app for easily use and gr8 restaurant quality as his ratings.such a best quality .,5
Deliver fast and quality food must try and I also read the reviews which some positive and negative also I am a google map reviewer and install first time and ordered and I didn't face any problem with related to food or delivery,5
I see a lot of improvement. Good offers. But can give better offers. 👍. Good keep it up Zomato. 👍👍.,5
"Ridiculously stupid, they keep transferring you to another executive and finally they stopped responding. And then I had to follow up the next day. And instead of addressing my concern, zomato, says they had a stern word with the restaurant and this should not be repeated!! What are you guys like 10 years old that you put in a stern word? I don't give a flying f... What I want is a value for my hard earned money.What you did was make the restaurant happy and not the customer. Customer service?",1
Good service .but some shops are not currently available and it shows currently not accepting orders,4
"App is good, but delivery charges on orders are sometimes too high.",2
Very very poor app never concern about their customers only money making app. I ordered the food and they send the wrong food and when i complaint they told please ignore this time next time we improve. Extremely dissatisfied with this poor app,1
Easy to use great app as customer service are always quick to answer and assist you with any issues with your order,5
The service is too bad Once u face problem no one is ready to solve Everyone is busy to cover up Even the customer care service as well Third class service Third class app Should learn from any other service providing app😡😡,1
I enjoyed about Zomato experience and I loved very much to order in Zomato,5
An order is canceled abrubtly without giving ny reason and when I try to contact the customer service there is only one response. We have given a refund. No further explanation!,2
still need application improvement coz some restaurants are accepting our orders later called us and told that they cant deliver to my place. These Small things create big problem for me.,4
"All prices are 20% higher than in-store prices. On top of that, we pay packing and delivery charges (which is double of swiggy). So a 100rs order costs 200rs via zomato. On top of this they have the nerve of asking us to tip!!!",1
"Nice range of restaurants, dishes covered with better deliveries and online support. Keep up the great work.",5
Last time i gave the review as excellent.. again I am telling it's more than the excellence.. It is awesome and the respect which we get from the Zomato team or from people is unreliable...,5
Don't go for advance payment... Once you paid them... Afterthat your order may be delivered next day... Also worst their customers support service,1
"Washim is one of the most important district of maharashtra. Zomato is not delivering food to washim. I mean, I am watching zomato's ad daily more than 100 times and zomato is not delivering me food. It is not fair, if you are not delivering food, then I have to strike against you.",1
Excellent service . Delivered before time .,5
VERY BAD EXPERIENCE 1) Peak time it's very hard to order one meal. They are coming up with demand is high and you should order upto 275 to 300 rps more 2) I have ordered some combo a week back . Deliver executive din get me the combo drink he is like resturant people din provide and he is telling me to raise a complaint. When I did customer care executive is like sorry next time it won't happen . Is that the way to sort out after paying 3) Delivery charges increasing badly Good going ZOMATO,1
Its delivery and 'Distance Charges' are higher than the actual food cost. Takes Rs. 30 to deliver food from my neighborhood lane.,1
Bad experience...after paying the total amount the order is missing and they give us the coupon by applying it also we have to pay the amount,1
"Overall, the Zomato App is pretty good. It is convenient and has improved over the years.",5
"Do check quality first, do not list resturants randomly",1
Nice app but still need some improvement in the packaging,4
Not allowing me to take takeaway from restaurants near my place...than whats the use of giving takeway option than. Raised query but got no response still. Already 18 days have elapsed but still no resolution in sight,1
"Zomato chat is not working for past 2 months for me.tried clearing app data,and reinstalling the app.still its not working.only stay on loading page.",1
I like this app but its should be 24hr active with delivery also...if its not possible then till 2am.because youngstars used to sleep at around 2am or 3am.,5
Good service but no guarantee of food quality,5
The most embarrassing and unprofessional application till date! Sorry to say but it is true. For good reputation try to keep atleast good delivery guys and teach them how to behave with customers. Every Zomato delivery guy I have met till date was so freaking angry and unprofessional and mannerless! Please update your location services as the food is not always delivered on same addresss and the delivery guys keeps on arguing with us on this useless topic for which I am not even responsible!,1
The worst experience I had is to the delivery boy didnt delievered the food. Though he says he has delievered the food but he should have called me while delivering. i never got any delivery call. And now they say the food is delivered. And they dont have customer care no. To reach neither they have chat option. Like the worst service,1
"Not servicing my office area... before lockdown ,they were servicing it... but not now... Swiggy is servicing this area... but why not zomato... lockdown ended long time ago... but their blackout hasn't ended...",1
"Everything about this app is great, but the so many filters they could also have added a halal filter",4
Awesome friendly UI and good customer support,5
Item not delivered though paid for. But msg came as delivered. Redressal mechanism good for nothing. Fed up.,1
Very good experience so far. Ordered quite a few times. The description inside the app is really good.,4
My order is delivered in almost 1 hrs 50 mins instead of estimated 45 mins because they clubbed my delivery with other delivery in my area. This is unacceptable. Why do you give estimated time if you're not going to deliver in time.,1
Most worst experience with zomato Order never came on time and customer care asking for 2 mins to contact to restaurant....but they didnt reach ....every time this happens.......,1
Very bad it's taking minimum of 1 hour for delivery irritating to wait that much long,1
The delivery charges is too steep to be considered for ordering. Hence signing off meaning uninstalled. Thank you for your services.,1
"Swiggy is available at my location, previously Zomato was also delivering, now no restaurants are showing. Even after complainting multiple times no response till now. Very pathetic.",1
Food delivery on time.. Money refund policy is also good I get back my deduct amount from account within given time period after chat with customer support service.,5
Excellent service..makes dining options easy and convenient without stirring out of your home or office..,5
Worst app swiggy is much better than zomato. There is no other option for paying online . The charges are comparatively very high . Slow processing app and with bad service,1
Very good app easy to access with the help of promotional code can able to eat more cheaper than actual rate in restaurant,5
Wrost app ever No solution for issue If food is bad its your fault because you ordered from that restaurent what the hell happening to zomato i ordered from zomato not dierectly from restaurent....,1
A very bad experience order full cheese burst pizza and delivered a 4 slice con pizza in chat support said send us over email order Id and issue but haven't mentioned email address and no call support .,1
Poor user experience. When refreshed many restaurants will not be available. Surge fees also increasing randomly,1
Delivery Charges are very high. Disappointed ! We think thousand times before ordering the food.,1
All items showing 30-35rs. on higher side as compared to order from restaurant,1
yeah well ordering food from differentdifferent outlet Zomato is considered to be a remarkable and also in delivering hot food does not believe in stealing food for half eaten parcel delivery it delivers funny hundred percent I feel I would give it around 7 out of 10 still it needs improvisation,5
"Inspite of using Pro, still the food prices are heavily charged by hotel, delivery and taxes are way too expensive, please reduce the cost of food and delivery.",1
App lies.. one place says free as missed the deadline and another place says only Rs 200 coupon you can claim.. And worst is in app says valet is at resturant and location says somewhere else.. Worst app and service. Full of lies.,1
This app has the worst partners that deliver the half eaten food/low quality but these guys do not take the responsibility of delivering better food. Unpunctual in the delivery is a top up.,1
Best Food App! It is very good and it gives us many coupon and I have experienced this app in both India and Dubai and its very great.,5
Some restaurants have hidden charges Zomato doesn't show that and when you cancel the order the full amount is not refunded they don't reverse the hidden charges...its kind of cheating... bill showed some different amount and UPI deduction added 60 rupees extra as hidden chrge extremely bad,1
"Stupid multiple order picking system, the one whose order has been picked up first shall always get ruined, soggy, cold food.",1
Experienced great app till date... No error in payments.. And delivery... Keep it up zomato.. Keep hinger filling... Doing great job..,5
"Quick delivery, sanitization and social distancing followed",5
Best then any other app on store.. Jst some resturanta they tie up with don't deserve to be with zomato...but mostly I always got satisfied with my orders.. ❤️,5
I can't placed order on zomato app many times app install and Uninstall. I can't find live restaurants on food delivery app,1
Compared to other apps it has worst customer service. I regret using zomato due to the irresponsible nature. If you have any issue they will make you wait for 20_30min,1
The time lapse tool is just fake it all is an adjustment you will make according to the food delivering timings. Better to remove it,3
"Delivery time is optimum. It takes 30 mins for every delivery, be that from a restaurant 15 mins away, or 30 mins. No other issues faced.Till date, that is my experience.",4
Good app for food delivery.Fast and secure.,5
May be improved further for ease of use..,4
I haven't received my order .its been a week since I mailed the complaint no action was taken neither did u refund the money I paid. I mailed several times and Ticket IDs r 7436625   7412286.plz look into the matter.,1
Orders don't get delivered on time. It does not give an option of free cancelling in such delayed cases. Worst service.,1
I am order for food which is deliver in 30 minutes but after 50 minutes I don't receive my food reason is delivery boy except two order in one time and my order is late and when I cancel my order zomato didn't give my prepaid amount.,1
"No features for changing address, making online order a hassle of made a minute mistake by taking wrong address once neither any option to cancel the order",1
At the night service is not so good just because of the resturent does not follow the proper ordering items.,3
Pathetic service as they always assigne two orders with one delivery boy...... And your order will come after 1:20 mints and some time after 1:30-40 mints..... Swiggy is always trusted delivery app ......,1
Overall it's good but I think every restaurant should have a picture of each item they have on their menu.,3
Not able to order food for the past 45 mins. It always gives me error try again during payment page.,1
Prices have increased on all foods and no offers like they used to give..too much delivery charges and unnecessary taxes are now there.,1
I used to order from swiggy usually..but there were no delivery option after 11 o'clock ..i installed zomato at 12 o'clock and ordered food...and now I've uninstalled swiggy... Zomato is far better than swiggy no caps,5
Fast delivery and good service,5
Super Fast Delivery Safe and Secure in this pandemic time Riders are friendly Love using this app,5
This app doesn't have an option for cancelling the placed order. If the payment is through online there will be no refund.,1
"Till now am happy with this app, very easy to use and user friendly, and the registered restaurant are quite good, except few cake shop as they say something else, and send something else in worst form. anyway App is very helpful.",5
"I used to order from zomato 4 years back, ive been with talabat for a long time, just recently i ordered from zomato and my order was bad. I feel zomato doesnt really care nor bother to contact the restaurant to understand what went wrong. The staff and the chat system is off and not good. No proper response its behind in so many ways.",1
"Very bad time progress line, not accurate at all, drivers waste a lot of time to deliver cold food... Bad experience",1
Delivery in time. And tasty super. My children likes very much. Thanks Zomato,5
Poor delivery experience. Just not bothered about customers. Long delays and no way to get across to them.,1
"Food taste matter the most and the taste is not upto the mark, in my family everybody love to eat chicken roll. After eating chicken roll from the imran kababs and momos restaurant they said it is third grade and throw in the dustbin full waste of money. I will suggest no to order anything from this restaurant.",1
"Hey Guys, Kindly notice that if you ordered any food from any restaurant, once you apply coupon then final price is same or more then the actual price of your food. Even, price of food on zomato is more than actual price listed in a restaurant. Simply, zomato is making fool to their customers. Jaago Grahak Jaago!",1
"Very less options for dishes without onion garlic. pls tell the sellers to mention without onion garlic dishes. I liked the shivsagar dine , yet not ordered but they mentioned abt jsin preparation. will soon order frm there.",3
"Very bad never go with this app, I got wrong item but I sent pictures more than 3 times but no 1 will respond and no 1 will resolve I'll suggest never go with this app very worst and bad experience",1
It should have the feature of ordering food in a single go from different restaurants. Rest all features and delivery etc. are nice.,4
The only reason why I'm giving you one star is because I'm just tired of watching your ads on every single YouTube video I watch. IT'S WAY TOO MUCH IRRITATING !!!,1
"Several complaints, but no resolution. Their customer service department is just dummy, not at all helpful. They are there just for mentioning apologies and begging next chance. #hatezomato",1
I loved this app too much it's easy to order and delivery is also fast mmm at given time,5
If there is any rating less then 1star then it goes to you guy's... Even you guys don't know how to get in touch with your restaurant.. Don't have courtesy to call the customer and apologize... More over giving the same written answers... I am informing all in my contact list uninstall the ZOMATO app and install other delivery apps who are delivers on time.. Still more reviews will go on other social media,1
"Worst response, delivered wrong food. Unprofessional approach, no body hear & don't resolve problem.",1
Ordered food at 10:30. Still waiting for delivery. Delivery guys not responding to calls. No help available on chat support,1
A very good app with a variety of restaurant to choose from. The promo code and the discount they provide is very good...,5
It's okay. Offers are needed to be given more in tyese trying times,4
App is super slow and some times purchased voucher code and coupons doesn't work on app and also high delivery charges and taxes...,1
Very nice app. Just one prob I faced that I gave my location correct but the valet went another place. Overall very nice,5
"Please, in addition to Calcutta, please do also the delivery in the surrounding districts. Help us get Zomato's services in all the people who are in the districts along with Kolkata😊",1
Very bad... Pathetic.... I ordered and they delivered incomplete order.. After complaining them and writing mail and feedbacks many times... They didn't refund my money... They don't even reply... They took my money and didn't not deliver complete order.,1
Bloody app i cant even connect to a agent that bot wont allowing me and said to email and they reply within 2 days but its been 4 days they didnt even replied me through email whats the use of sending email if no one is replying through that one. Worst customer service,1
This app never disappoint me and it is easy to use and no payment issue like other food delivery app specially swiggy...,5
"I am editing my review from 5 stars to 3 stars because of Zomato's very poor customer service helpline. Unlike SWIGGY that refunds your money immediately, Zomato takes a ridiculously long time for even an amount of rs 32. When it finally does refund, it gives you only rs 26/- So again I complain about this dishonesty and inefficiency. Then again I wait. And then I get a further refund of rs 6. Zomato is this what you call efficiency? Or honesty? Very disappointed with you.",3
"Really amazing I ordered pizza from US Pizza today, amazing taste in the world. Today, I have not tasted the wireless taste in the world. I have enjoyed the best tasting test, excellent cheese, fresh vegetables and a great base pizza. I reached out to us in a very good time, I did not eat such a delicious pizza, till date, the best of my experience till date, whenever we go to Metro Mall, US Pizza will surely eat only that pizza today. Enjoyed and am eager to test all the pizzas. Thanks US Pizza",5
Zomato should improve the live tracking of the order. Sometimes the driver location cannot be tracked.,5
"Don't have the time sense, the restaurant which gives you the timeline but it takes time to deliver. Waste of time",1
"Nice delivery app and very good service, delivery executive was very polite and humble.",5
Not taking guarrenty of food quantity and quality. I had order chicken full handi in that leg poece of chiken is not there and even after chat with customer care they refuse to refund partial amount.. thats not great deal zomato you are the mediator between restaurant and customer you should take responsibility....,1
I Highly do not recommend using zomato switch to other delivery apps they have better customer service and in-time delivery zomato cannot deliver on time never . Highly disappointing service.,1
"Pathetic service, for nearby restaurant 5 Mins away, they take 1 hour to deliver, even after the food being ready to be delivered.",1
"I needed to edit my review...even after ordering food from pure veg restaurent if you get non-veg items, how would you feel. Today i ordered veg items from veg restaurent but got non-veg stuffs, felt really bad😔",1
"Zomato is a saviour during exam times. And so far so good, I'm impressed with the services. Good luck",5
Delivery Person who came was very polite and respectful.,5
Worst money refund will be in 4 to 5 day you guy fooling us like restaurant don't have the item kept over the menu instead of not available and showing as available and steal money from Us and refund in 4 to 5 business day this is nice business Worst consumer Service ever seen lol see the review of other consumers review the most are 1 start not even deserve one start if I had option to 0 you guy deserve it,1
"Ek dum mast👍 Just a suggestion, please request all your riders not to drive hurriedly on road as 10 to 15 minutes here and there is okay with the customers 🙏 Riders life is more important than food😊",5
"Worst customer service ever, my cashback is pending n had waited for so long but the customer service chat executive is just not replying as if he slept off during his shift, i kept on waiting n waiting he is just typing 2 messages and just going offline.",2
"Bad experience with the order, order delivery person and executive chatting to resolve. Order placed at 4:30 PM and not delivered until writing this review ...",1
Everything is nice but when you order something and you see the promo will be not available for the order please change this,4
Very fast delivery and the delivery executives are very humble and deliver it on time and at exact location without calling and asking for address.,5
Service is very fast. Delivery guys are very decent and polite. Fully satisfied with Zomato,5
"Very disappointed with the food ,tandoori chicken sandwich was soo bland had no tandoori flavour in it chicken was bland in taste extremely disappointed with the sandwich, chicken Lasagne was very sweet in taste and it was disappointing too 😖, an offer of lemon tea on bill of above 400 was not mentioned to us too and later was said that offer starts from tomorrow",1
I absolutely love this App. Thank you very much for your delivery services. It's has become such an integral part of our lives and I think it deserves appreciation for what it is.,5
It was very quick delivery within 15 mins it reached home. The valet was also wearing a mask and maintained social distancing. He talked very politely and was well mannered. Anyways it was an excellent experience.,5
"Everytime I use Zomato I have an extremely terrible experience with your Customer care. I ALWAYS prefer Swiggy over Zomato ANY day. I only used Zomato yesterday to order from one restaurant called Dilawer which is not there on Swiggy and I regretted it ! Restaurant cheated me with serving yesterdays stale food, Zomato accused me of consuming the food even though I had photo evidence that I had not, Increased my blood pressure and remained hungry and wasted Rs 511. Will never use Zomato again!",1
No option to arrange the change of delivery adress in case I have made mistake and have given wrong adress.,2
Does not give the right location. Coercive behaviour to pay before hand through online method. Really bad app. Use swiggy. They never eat my head and disturb my mental peace. Zomato sucks!,2
"Missing food item from the order, no one is taking the responsibility : neither the restaurant nor the valet. They provided me with off in return but i still need to pay about 3/4th of my original order's price. Not at all customer friendly",1
"Worst service by zomato, zomato vallet switched of phone. Chat service did not have a clue when the order would be delivered. My daughter was waiting for the waffle had to sleep disappointed. Worst service.",1
not as useful as it used to be as the information are not updated regularly now. I would use the Google map listing instead.,1
"I like everything about zomato. Their vast options, quick delivery and prompt response for any inconvenience.",5
"Pathetic customer sy, with no ownership if an order has been placed through the application, these people keep revolving between chat executive and they don't solve your problem, Avoid this app for delivery related orders.",1
"App is great, reliable and fast delivery! Only the delivery charges are quite high at times",5
Why double orders!!!! And making one customer waiting too long for food.. just because u guys make some more profit !!!!! Very poor service,1
It is very useful in vivid times I think sonata is the best food deleverying app,4
Enjoyed ordering foodover Zomato and delivery are upto the expectation..,4
Very good service bt sometimes coupons will not give. If we order everyday also they vl not give coupons so for that coupons i gave 4star. Otherwise service was very nice.,4
It's good app but most of the they charge twice like restaurant charges n delivery charges I want they show only one charge only delivery charges,3
You think your notifications are cool but it's too much now they are disturbing. I have to uninstall this app every time after ordering food.,1
ZOMATO services are very very good in my city.. I just love to order from this site than others.. I have no bad experinces with their services and food also.. Their delivery boy always on time.. Their foods and packagings are very well.. I Love ZOMATO☺,4
"Unable to contact support, no way to go back to choosing an option if you chose wrong in the first place",1
"Love the selection of restaurants. prices are cheaper than dine in, with convenience of home delivery.",5
"On Time , hot food delivery , very nice Delivery boy , delivered the order on time , service is fast and good",5
"It's expensive, it's time consuming, it's not accurate, but at least delivers even if not on time.",2
"Very good service, delever right to your doorstep.. something they don't have to make a call to customer, very nice location tracking",5
Very nice and helpful app for fooding.,5
No control of Zomata on restaurants. I am saying this because if you receive incomplete or wrong order then you have to sleep empty stomach so be ready for it if you are ordering dinner on zomato.,1
Zomato customer support is v disappointing. I ordered 2 curries from Ravi dhaba. Quality of food was pathetic. When i complained to customer support they said they cant control the quality of food. They asked me to give rating of restaurant and closed the conversation If such an issue happens in swiggy they give full refund immediately. Swiggy is the best.,1
The customer service is very good & supportive. Apart from this the user interface of the app is quiet good & great. I like ZOMATO,5
Best online food delivering app. Just wanna say thank you to zomato that how much hard they worked for us in this pandemic. THANK YOU ZOMATO!🤗☺,5
"Poor delivery, ordered at 8:30pm and still waiting for the pizza(10:43)",1
Its a fantastic app because the delivery charges is very low and covid the delivery boy take all the precosions nice app.,5
Love the app...very good app for food ordering....very fast delivery...and service is also good...,5
very good service and best place for couple....,5
It is very good app compared with Swiggy and uber eats and etc it has fast delivery than the actual time he show and with live location by Google Maps,5
"It's really good and safe , I like there services And it's easy to use",5
Horrible charges for normal food. Food charge was110/- and Handling charges are 70/- !!!!!!! Better you do robbery....,1
promo code is not applied...its cheating... Cooking istructions are not followed...pay attention..,1
It’s a great experience!!. The ambiance is very welcoming and charming. Amazing food and service. Staff are extremely knowledgeable and make great recommendations.,5
superb service . quick delivery.,5
Amazing place to hangout with friends. The food is absolutely delicious and is very affordable. Must visit.,4
it saved our personal time which consume by traveling to shops & give order wait there and before this get ready you going outside home delivery + discounts + Nowatime safety Also customer is happy and I feel who is in this much need to take cares & do safe work & customer be safe at home thank you,5
Worst delivery app . No proper response from customer care executives. Always needs an exception for every problem raised .,1
Best app and always better than swiggy. Unnecessarily being trolled by everyone for every small issue. Their service is always good and kept improving. So I choose Zomato.,5
Delivery person is roaming near by but not picking up the call..... And also on map my house location is showing elsewhere.,1
Good helpful but delivery and taxes are high,4
I would suggest to never use this app again. Worst for servicing and for refund process. We have to bear loss for their mistakes. Such unfair,1
Very useful and handy for food ordering,5
Very bad app. Never order with this app. There customers care blame you for your concern. Never try it,1
If your vender not attempted delivery then why u live them ?? Why you not set delivery timing for them. Also mention in your app if they not ready to take order.... Need to improve more thing zomato? Please work on it and also improve instantly repayment if order not fulfill by you.,1
"Pathetic Service, ordered 2 sabji and 11 roti but received only 5 roti and sabji, now the customer support are resoving the issue and giving refund for only the missed item, but the are not thinking that what should i do with the incomplete order. Also i have placed the order for me and my guest, but i feel very insulted because of this issue at weekend.",1
"Pro membership is a useless option, refrain from wasting your money on this. In my app it never showed me more than 2-3 restaurents which falls in Pro category. It's a SCAM!",1
Prepaid Order not delivered. No refund. Not recommended at all.,1
Nice app and super fast delivery with good delivery boy,5
"I had a bad customer experience First of all, they did not deliver what they'd promised and they kept blaming us for no reasons.. The customer support manipulates so much. I was so distressed and shocked to see the responses. Never never going to order from Zomato. Switching back to Swiggy!",1
"Best delivery services, exciting prices, great Menu and choice overloaded as per demand. Keep using zomato to be served with best food.",5
"The service is the best I have ever encountered, Quality and taste of the food is also outstanding...I had a wonderful dinning experience....I had tried Paneer Matki here...",5
"Very fast, clear and informative. Even an illiterate also can go through and order.",4
Why did you guys remove the order tracking?? That's supposed to be a basic functionality!!,2
My daughter wrongly placed the order at different address. I cancelled immediately even after that zomato deducted 50% amount. Such a farud. We did not want to place this order my small daughter 3 year did it while playing.,1
Too much delay in order receipt. Useless app,1
Payment got debited twice and the order became duplicate. The delivery executive took tye second order. When I reached out to customer care they said they can't do anything. How much money would they be swindling like this everyday!,1
Support service is pathetic. We have to so long for someone get assigned for chatting. And who ever is assigned to me was damm slow in replying.,1
Totally stupid riders are in this ...first entered the right street and then went back to somewhere without giving the order..totally idiots ..i will never use this app anymore,1
Can't change delivery address even immediately after ordering.,1
Good delivery app but same restaurant's not give importants of customer's food,5
Even after pro discount and applying special discount coupon its always expensive than actual price and even with in 2km radius charging 20% for delivery charges,2
"Address trailing is difficult, because I thought that last time delivery done but this time it was difficult to find out address. Needs to consult about address verification.",3
"I have ordered from Manish eating point, Gomti Nagar, lko the order was veg roll and hakka noodles in place of this the order came was mixed veg soup and only noodles without any seosning.",1
The great food delivery app and provide everything at time to time and need some rider friendly to there own riders,5
I have placed order on 21 feb. the delivery boy was argueing about location n not ready to give service on my place which i have already mention in address ..even i was try to guide him to come on proper place. he was not ready to listening also. and in case of hygene n safty he did not wear mask . n not sanitise himself. it shows arrogant behavior of zomato team.,1
if more than 5 star option is available then i would give that....very fast...satisfied...and recomended to others.,1
The service is awesome. Every important and available thing is provided. service on time. well done.Keep it up Zomato.,5
During take away we can see little lesser rates in restaurants as compared to Zomato menu for same dishes. Default promo codes are good .,3
Order placed but forgot to apply promcode then trying to cancel and replace order in 2 minutes but showing 75₹ cancel fee 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😡🤬🤬😡 bhenc....🤬🤬🤬🤬,1
I have ordered food I have an issue with order From last 1 hr they are not responding about anything Very poor customer support Very poor service,1
"Very late delivery, change your policy of taking two to three orders at a time and then distributing them to customers.",1
The time shows in dlelivery not updated every time I had just order food and since last 10 minutes is showing 13 mint left and food is still not picked up,3
"Zomato's services have become pathetic now, I got my order delivered today within 9 minutes after placing it and the food was not even cooked and was smelly , was completely stale food, had a thread in d biryani as well and when I tried to chat with zomato, they didn't even allow me to initiate a chat with them, pathetic service and m not gonna leave it here, gonna social dis and will be tagging such big fraudsters, I have those pics with me , Had a very bad experience.",1
Food delivery is always on time and its really safe according to covid safety measures. They take precautions and is safe to get food from them.,5
"Very poor customer service. I have to order biryani, but Zomato is asking to add more food to place order. Without adding additional food I wasn't able to place order. I complaint about same, they are not replying. They started looting people.",1
The user interface is really good vs the other apps. But now it keeps on crashing!,3
A fully cheese pizza and a cold cohoclate coffee just for RS 100 ONLY. Me and my brother are like didn't eaten food for 5 hrs and after we ordered that and eat it . And after eating two slice were left and our tummies were full as hell and that cheesssss. APPRENTICE IT,5
Very good app for easy ordering of food,5
I am a gold member but there is no difference that I feel a 50 inr relief is sad :( I paid for the membership and I am still paying and getting no discounts at all :(,3
Overall Zomato is always good and their delivery boys are so well behaved and the quality of food is good.,5
Very bad app .. Any meals and pizza fully smelld not provide a fresh meal and pizza.. So suggetion my all.friend not use this zomato app ... I am special regard for you my friend this app provide veei smell meals .. So please do not use this app 😡😡😡😡,1
Didnt get a discount even on my 1 st order...no cancellation policy and too much delivery surge.The no cancellation policy has recently resulted in the delivery boy hitting case,1
its really helpful...when u r tired n want some food ..then here's ..the best app to order delicious food with variety of choices,5
It delivers within time and also the delivery boys are quite decent. Thank you so much for providing such good service.Keep this goodwill.,5
"I love Zomato, these guys are the savior during difficult times. Offers are also perfect and no issues during deliveries. Keep it up guys.",5
Promo code didn't apply properly and customer service told me to consider this issue as sn exception!! How can they say that..,1
Food was spilt out of containers...half was wasted. This is bad and not acceptable.,1
Really a good app... Help to sort out of the starvation... It makes late night food deliveries too and with no extra charge ☺️... Just wanna say Thanks for it..,5
App is good and easy to use...Zomato delivery is good..,5
WTH.. After the update cannot order anymore.. The screen go black itself n take me back to my wall. I feel unsafe this bugs will scam my order.. Fix or I delete,1
"There is no support from the zomato agents from the night order issues. And when you order from aftet 9 pm it's taking so more time to assign an executive and to prepare the order and to deliver as well. When we are chatting the issue with an agent there no replies rather than a forwarded text saying hey im...... And im here to assist you today. So bad.., giving zomato 2 star is a respect from me at least to be considered it.",2
the best food ordering app. I have order multiple times and I'm fully satisfied with the service.,5
Support unreachable and resturants are always sending partial orders. No one to validate or help. Just wasting money. Swiggy is muxh better than this useless app,1
Very poor service & alwaya delay in delivering the order,1
Had worst experience during corona. Now also . Every now and then says that order cannot be delivered to my pincode. Tech issue bt kindly resolve it.,1
Items are ok to buy... But there is irritating when they charge or tax of rs 23 of rider.... I think zomato should reduce the amount of charges,3
Loved the way this app has adapted. Was an early adopter!,5
Always all the outlets are either closed or doesn't deliver to my address. Zero star required.,1
Your delivery guy is a total disaster. He's unable to read the location. Has wasted our precious time by calling again and again. Order cancelled. Is there a minus star that I can give? This delivery boy should be sacked. He can cause blood pressure and stroke to anyone. We are senior citizens over 70 years of age. Exasperating experience..,1
Please add cash on delivery!! I don't understand y u took out that option......I want to ordr but every time it says no cash on delivery available...fix it!,3
What the hell... They accepted order. Payment is done and after half an hour they canceled it..,1
"Worst food delivery.. im order food at 7:12 pm,, its showing 45 minits delivery and ontime delivery why??over one hour late delivery.... Too late Very bad with zomoto orders😢😢",1
"I'm using Zomato again after a long time. And I have found it to be amazing. Thanks, Zomato!",4
"Bakwas app. They show 38min before order, and make it 55 after order. And their tracking map don't refresh automatically.",1
"Amazing , indias' fastest delivery , but it is best food ordering app",5
My first experience with Zomato online food delivery was great. Thanks to your team and effort for customer satisfaction.,5
Good offers.easy to use.Many restaurants to choose from.On time delivery. Good experience so far,5
"Now they are increasing the prices, which are more than Restaurent prices And time shows my Zomato is absolutely fake",1
"good offers , good food but yes sometimes we do have a problem with certain other's from certain resturants or cafes as they don't deliver the expected order so hence r star",4
"So far so good... My only concern is even as a PRO customer, I have no incentives/discounts from most of the outlets.",5
"Bought mutton qalouti kebab in this restaurant day before yesterday, it was so small in size but in the menu it was very appealing, they put misleading ads and images which is very disappointing, moreover the taste of the kebab was awful, it was full of chat masala. I raised a complaint, the owner called me yesterday and said she will quality check & do the needful for what happened, but till now no action on that.",1
Timely delivered in good condition.,5
Very bad way of working. Alot 3-4 delivery to valet at the same time. They take lots of time and food gets cold. What's a point for ordering for hot food.,1
I have tried many times to install this app.But everytime report bug problem comes. App does not open. How this problem can be ressolved?,1
The app shouldn't allow delivery riders and customers to exchange numbers. Rather have an autogenerated call when arrived with the location.,4
Last Update Has A Terrible Experience... Before Update App Shows 1139 Resturants Near Me Which I Can Order But After Update It Only Shows 153 Restaurants... I tried Every Possible Thing To Check About Setting But Ended Its About This Crazy Update...,1
Most of the time your delivery amount is refunded and items not delivered,1
Customer service related features not working/ included. Only you can see promotions and features benefits to company. Very poor customer support features,1
fabulous and delicious . Good to be available at Karimnagar,5
seating uncomfortable for 2 members. most of the tables are available but dint allowed to change. staff Gopal and Karim are good in serving and very patience.,3
"Somewhat laggy in loading, plus interface is too much complex. Could have been simplified.",2
The app is so frickin buggy. Wouldnt even let me go past the landing page. Fix this already.,1
gud app and quick service. Lots of options these days. Improving alot over period of time.,5
"I had the worst costumer service experience and when I tried to cancel my subscription it wasn't even applicable, shame",1
Awesome.. The delivory boys are very patient to understand exact address and deliver food!!,5
Order taking & delivery is in timely manner..,5
"App is absolutely amazing, always providing discounts to their users, never bugging, providing correct informations, absolutely brilliant 👏",5
"Very nice app, quick search and offers.",5
I liked the delivery time quick Communication with the shop and the boy picking your order all things are good.,5
Does not offer proper customer service ... Will ignore customers and not respond even on chat ... Chat service is required when there is an issue ... If there is no chat service what service do u have?,1
Order has been repeated. App doesnt notify that few items are not available. Wrong got selected and delivered.,2
"Very poor experience. For order delays, they don't act. Always shows helplessness, very negative approach.",1
Worst experience.... The order that was supposed to be delivered in 40 mins was not delivered even after 2hrs .... Rider didn't even answer the call ...tried so many times,1
"Few Unprofessional Delivery guys made me do this..!! I made my payment online, then delivery guy isnt able to come due to studid reasons & asks to cancel the order... I wont get my refund.. And he will enjoy my meal i guess... Already reported in Help & Support but I got no proper answer from them too. Is this what we call Zomato Service?",1
Excellent delivery! Very well customer service. The delivery boy was very well mannered and soft spoken!,5
"Many times orders are canceled and no money refunded, happended with me many times.. Very bad experience and untrused customer service.",1
Items added to cart but the cart prompt is not opening. My internet is good. Changed my network still no good.. now i can't order,1
"Best app for delivery of essential food items, groceries, green vegetables, fruits in a contactless manner.very fast service,very useful",5
It gives you easily nearby restaurants that are always open even in late nights for your orders & that is best thing I found in this app !,5
Best food ordering app ! You can track the delivery agent assigned to you and order food according to your preferences easily! 😉,5
Pathetic customer support. Chat support & Call support. Fake promises and later apology templates. But no solution.,1
delivery guy didn't not pickup the order from restaurant and said it is delivered. not even listen to our concern. then Zomato will give ₹200off on your next order to compensate your hunger for whole night.,1
Good quality food and delivery on time,5
"I am pro member, the app is good but the pro membership benefits are not enough.",4
Zomato is becoming worst day by day .... Making their customers wait for 1 hour and then not even delivering the food... Along with that instead of sending zomato riders they are now telling restaurants to send their own riders which cant even by tracked down... Worst experience ever,1
Day by day getting its service worst. Never getting a delivery on proper time. Taking a delivery charges but not giving the delivery properly. Worst services.,1
The food was delivered on time and the quality was also good...they have improved their version...,5
Zomato improved massively compared to last time I've used it and has now taken the first spot between my delivery apps,5
Excellent App for all kinds of Cuisines.,5
"Customer support is worst, as food was not exactly what is show, when contacted support they offered me rs30 coupon for 150rs order, i throughed it out. I think swiggy is better than zomato.",1
"We have been trying to list our bakery almost for a week, there is no response from zomato, nobody picks up the call, neither no revert on mail also. Struggling to start our business throigh zomato.",1
It's a great application for me to order food 🍴🍕🍔 but it will be great if it offers the price with the original rate nor high neither low,5
"Zomato executives have been very disappointing with their support. Not only did they not add the 50 rs coupon which they themselves had offered for an issue with one of my orders, they did not even apologise for missing this. The Zomato executive was rude about it.",1
"One bad customer support is enough to loose a customer. Zomato lost one. Refunds are not proper. If the food quality Is poor or wrong order received or spillage the refunds are not paid. This may be a problem with the restaurant, still ZOMATO is responsible because I order through ZOMATO. ZOMATO should make sure about the restaurant quality.",1
Superb app For delivering it takes less than thought not no delivery boy calls more than 2 times no troubles,5
"I made online payment,the amt was debited from bank but zomato said transaction failed and that they didn't receive the payment",1
Very good. This the only food delivery app I have been using after using this because I uninstalled all the other apps.,5
Overall service is good but i want to give one suggestions guys... When someone orders nonveg please tell them to add toothpicker also in package so it will be complete meal👌,4
"Good experience , good app , fast delivery but delivery charge 100 rs. , But over all love it 😍🤗😘 , best app",5
Maps does not get updated every minute & sure cannot view the exact location of the driver after pick up .,3
very professional. getting deliveries on time. no worries. Mainraining the service quality during Covid19 times... Really remarkable.,5
"your timing is worng, 2-3 minutes it's been same time its not even changing.",1
"No live support at all now , even Valet is delaying order on its own Pro discount is useless at all , they told priority delivery but its been 1 hour + 1 extra hour as per Valet",1
Very helpful app. The feedback is very good. Immediate response. Proper action is being taken for review. Good service. Really appreciated,5
This app i loved this is cheap in cost and had a contact less delivery. The delivery boys are puntual of there time,5
Lets cut the gimmicks of maximum safety and all that .. should train the valet ... Sometimes they dont even wear the Zomato uniform... And the time updates are totally lie .. if an order takes 1 hours to deliver then say it upfront dont keep on posting arriving in 10 mins and deliver it one hour later,1
"Good Service, Reasonable Rate & Quality Taste.......",5
Ultimate Zomato Application experience.. user friendly .. zomato gives superb discounts too.,5
I'm disappointed. When ever I order something I get a call from that restaurant or bakery saying that I item is not there then why don't Zomato update it on the menu,1
I used this app at first time and i got good sarvice from Zomato so i wanted to give 5 rates but i gave 4 by first service but after more sarvices i will give 5 or 3 it will depend on sarvices......!!!! Let's see .....!!!!,4
"In order to indicate offer, Please use percentage offer. This "" up to..... Amount"" is so confusing and irritating.",1
"Best app, the delivery persons are very good persons and lot of promo codes available",5
No issues since using service for 1 year.,5
In this app only I can get my order delivered to my address. No app can delivery to my address only zomato can deliver to my address.. It is the best app forever... Tanq u so much zomato..,5
"Great customer service.Have been a customer for a year or so and when faced with an issue regarding order from the restaurant side twice,got it resolved in a matter of minutes with refund. Thank u Zomato",5
Its 3rd time my order isn't delivered and delivery guy has mentioned he has delivered. Only when I saw the notification I msg for help. Waited another 1 hour for team to figure out. As result refund initiated and I don't know what do I do now. It's always not about money..!!,1
Great experience with zomato. Fast delivery and fresh food. Keep going zomato great job... 👌👍,5
"We orderd papa John's pizza , order reached at exact time mentioned in the Application, fresh and hot , delivery staff are very professional 👍👍 i used to use other applications and this is my frist experience in Zomato and am sure it will not be the last🤩🤩 thank you ..",5
Worst. Cannot talk to zomato or chat our issue. Its only pre typed message. What if a customer has another issue. Zomato doesn't care,1
This is the best app for food lovers ....because there are many offers and coupons. I love this.....,5
"Apart from all the best ones please try to avoid all these restauarants which uses thier own valet to deliver the food,it was disguisting.And try to remodel the desktop version of zomato website.",5
Collecting more delivery charges compare to other apps Don't know when application works & when it gets strucks. No offers in this application,1
This is wonderful app as it is easy to use and makes work easy,5
Worst experience I have ordered and u have made payment too but because of some emergency I couldn't be there.so I have cancelled..... these Zomato ppl didn't refunded my money,1
Order experience is nice but the delivery prices are high in some restaurants than the usual dining prices.,4
"Every app now has dark mode, provide it on your app. Sometimes app becomes buggy with no reason on high end phones too.",3
I am changing my 5 star rating to 1 star just because your riders have stopped following COVID protocols. No mask. No uniform. Some of them will ride with a pillion. And your chat system for solving customer issue is very pathetic and slow. From last couple of orders I am not able rate your riders and have to deal with your annoying chatbots and slow responding chat personals.,1
Today I ordered Biryani from the app. and I typed the correct address. The app took another address on it's own and they didn't refund the money and the customer care call cut the call without any other information. Worst app ever and for their own mistake they are charging the customer.,1
"Experience bad habits at the night delivery ,not delivery at the right time and packet sealing not upto the mark,thinking not to place any order at night.",4
Great experience. Fast and quality food,5
I lost my money to zomato as a they deducted the amount from my account and I never got the refund nor they returned the item which I had purchased. There is no customer service department to solve the querry. Very very bad service.,1
Awful feedback / chat system. Very poor response system from the customer care support system.,2
Delivery person picked order from restaurant but could not deliver. Customer care executive cancelled order. I received refund but it was a very bad experience as we all were hungry.,1
Nice and it brings the food to home in one call.love it so much. Thanks Zomato developer. Hats off. And easy to use the app.,5
"Please don't remove cash on delivery option many people who don't have bank accounts they can't order food , zomato is best than all food delivery apps because there is cod option",5
Very bad service. Order once placed can be cancelled but money will not be refunded. I m very sorry but others apps are far better,1
The app is user friendly but very slow.It takes around 10 minutes to just apply the promo codes.fix the glitch.,3
"They cancell orders themselves, if they could not reach on time ... they won't refund... if you have made online payment",1
Everything is good but everytime i order something the app doesnt work for next few hours after placing the order please fix this as i am unable to give the ratings to zomato riders,1
App chat support is no longer working. There is no way to report if something is not correct with order.,1
I thought it would be very helpful to me but It do not make delivery in Nashik. I am very disappointed from Zomato as it is still limited to his customers.,1
Online payments are not happening. It is showing transaction failed. Please correct it.,1
Every time I use zomato I don't get disappointed. Very smooth and easy to use and very thankful for it especially nowadays with corona.,5
I just had a amazing experience using this app their delivery is faster than the other .i suggest the one who is reading to install and use it thanks me later...,5
Not much discounts.. need to monitor the restaurants proactively as they are not giving the proper service.,3
"the quality, quantity and packaging... everything was top class. The quantity did justify the pricing.",5
"Cake was received in delapidated condition. The sole purpose of the Zomato was just to provide the cake in good condition, whxih wasn't fulfilled. 1 on 5 star.",1
Charging delivery charges for a very short distannce delivey also. Rates are as such higher on zomato than local menu card of the same eatery.,1
Awesome.... amazing offers all the time variety of restaurants and fast delivery also 😋👌👌👌,5
Outstanding! Just one word is enough. Plz keep up the good work. Every stone u breach is your new milestone.compete with your self and keep tracking yourself for improvement.all the best!,5
One star less since app keeps asking for rating. Even after doing so and no dark mode,4
Very worst experience with Zomato they simply taking orders and after long time send message as your order cancelled.They play games with customers and nobody can approach you for properly 👎🙅 Note : so meny times we are facing this issue,1
Really pathetic service rider took extra cash from my wife and then not responding the calls. Also i get in touch for the same concern with support team they always say we are transferring your case to senior after wasting 1hours then senior came and say we can't do anything just dropp a mail.,1
Order cancellation should be allowed ... If child 👶 order something mistakely then how should we cancel the order.. Also their resurants are not picking up the phone..,1
Nice Provide out station mobile no option so that we can able to book order for parents too,4
Best thing about Zomato it provides great discounts even for non pro members.. however changing delivery location could sometimes be annoying...😁,4
Lovely app to be used for food ordering.,5
Very Late Delivery takes more than 1hr from Valet Pickup to Delivery in the Radius of 3Km..,2
What the hell is this every time i try to order any dish above 300 it does not accept cash payments while I am not having any debut or credit card every time this app sucks🤬🤬😡😡,1
Worthless delivery service.. not delivering to concerned address..,1
"My experience with zomato so far has been very nice but I would like to give 4 stars due to social problems going on , on media... Keep going..",4
One of the best application for the food delivery.,5
"..would rather not get an overhauled interface at all, if such is the state of the app , we all so much rely on, for food.",2
Very bad service.. first they accepted the order then cancel it by themselves... you shoul not accept the order if you cannot complete it,1
"When I order, every time I am receiving late, because Zomato giving multiple orders to delivery boy, I am very disappointed this type of service.",1
"Enjoying zomat app now, Last couple of months It wasn't that good to offer Great quality In suitable price.",5
Zomato is the best app for ordering food online.If any problem is there with restaurant and food they solve the problem immediately.,5
If you want to order something minimum amount order then they increases delivery charges. Worst app ever.,1
"Always a problem with delivery, even the customer service is slow in resolving the issue.",1
Worst service.. I have waited for 2 hrs and then finally they told me some other guy pick up the order.. and order can't be fulfilled. What a stupid services. I will be uninstalling your app,1
👌👍Brilliant Food Delivery App. ..&. .. Best Offers For Daily Purchase For Any Order And Fastest Delivery Boys 🙏👍👌👌✌️,5
Awesome app awesome customer service and experience will surely recommend it follows all instructions thoroughly even gives refund delivery executive are too polite and professional,5
"Food prices is less in the restaurants as compared to mentioned in the app, price inflated & then discount offered for good restaurants.",2
They have no option to allow you to claim a refund for late delivery. My delivery was delayed substantially but according to Zomato it was delivered on time,1
Completely useless customer service. Delivery guys are good. Restaurant sends wrong delivery and these guys keep making you go round and round with Zero resolution,1
I love using Zomato but sometimes I've faced issues regarding quality of the food the restaurant's served. Otherwise it's really good.,5
This is a very best app of food delivery.,5
"Delivery guys are good, however the food quality may vary",5
"Best app i have ever seen for delivery status even app delivers best service . You cannot get this type of service in any app so it's best And keep ordering Regards, User",5
"No value of money,, i had ordered food food delivery is perfect time ,, but food is not dilecious ,, this ordered had my first and last",1
"Very Bad experience,unable to get in touch with them via chat ,many time inncorect ,missing food came but unable to get in touch with them and face losses",1
It's a truly helpful app when you have to buy food online. I trust in it fully and their service is indeed good.,5
Live tracking does not work. I will need to keep refreshing the page to view the current status.,2
Till now experience is good hope it maintains its stability... 👍👍 Need to add more resturant Need to add variety in snacks Need to add variety in ice creams Need to add special kids discounts on ice creams snacks which liked by kids..,4
"Very bad service in Cochin, Kerala. Auto decline is happening after processing the payment and our payment will be refunded only after 7 days only. Please take care while processing the order. Also very poor online customer support, they don't respond to our queries.",2
Pathetic experience location tracking is not accurate. Some technical glitch has been observed in the application,1
Nice genuine details of restaurant and mainly there are discounts which I enjoy a lot. Love this app. Thanks to zomato.,5
Restaurants ranking is worst nd all road side vendors is on this àpp by mistake if you order this road side vandors then you can be feel regrets,1
"Pathetic service, rude behaviour of delivery staff, annoying delivery time list goes on and on",1
Loved the experience. Very convenient to use and easy to send food to my loved ones.,5
Worst chat bot experience I have ever had with no competence in being able to understand the fact I wanted to cancel the order!!! Horrible customer service,1
"The support chat is bugged , cant use.",1
There is no solution provided by the customer service worst place to look for food . Swiggy is much better in all terms possible.,1
1. Please add dark mode 2. Please make the ui more suitable for split screen(tracking screen).,3
Very good app quick delivery and great app experience,5
The instructions do not work.. Even after giving clear instructions. Its useless to give instructions coz it does not reach the resturant.,1
Had lot of bad experiences...Many times order got cancelled after half the delivery time..They do not update on the items availability,1
Whenever I start placing order... It keeps on buffering going round n round reminding me of playing YouTube in my childhood even after I updated the new app version.,1
Worst ever app used. It's better to use swiggy not zomato. Placed a order with promo code and in sudden order gets cancelled. No promo code loss of money. Only half amount refunded. Guys please be careful. Never use this.. All the time it happens,1
"Can't place order, it doesn't redirect to payment page, just stays on the last page .",1
Very happy with this app.if we Have any any issues with food zomato will not act like 3rd party vendor instead they will take initiative to satisfy us.,4
Very poor never be at the current delivery location every time I oder every I have wait 20 to 30 mins bcz of wrong location 👎 improve this,1
Your new advertisements on YouTube have a really annoying music. And the ads are dumb!!!!!!,1
Delivery time is ok but food quality is not good thank u for the fast delivery zomato👍,4
I'd recommend to take zomato Pro to get additional discounts. Fair pricing and good listing of restaurants,5
The app is very easy to use and efficient as well...it's so good to have something so efficient in Lebanon with everything going on...,5
I ordered pizza from Round House it took almost 2 hours to respond and when I asked to cancel then charges applicable. Inspite there fault.,2
Experience is good but some delay place order,3
Very good app...... Fresh foods are delivered..... And delivery is fast..... Recommend others to try this app,4
Cakes are more than awesome and super tasty..... my whole family love it even my relatives and neighbours are love it... thank u cake in house for superb cakes....,5
Zomato always having shortage of drivers. Food ia ready at restaurant and no valet allotted till the time you contact with Zomato team for there allotments of valet to deliver food. Very disappointing.,1
"Very worst, delivery time more than two hours and they r charging for delivery. No response from team for customers concern. Better to delete this app",1
Regular user of Swiggy. Used your app for a couple of times. The user experience is much better and also the discounts are good. I guess I will be switching to Zomato as long as you keep it up.,4
Due to some network issue my order got cancelled but my payment deducted from my account last 10 days yet I have not get my refund they don't have proper customer service for help also very bad experience,1
"I loved zomato but off late, the app just won't open. It crashes before it can even load.",3
Very easy app to use .. and so people are very professional..,5
The best side for food delivery all are friendly and they want to earn a customer not a money that's the Gr8 thing.. Keep rocking zomato. I have decided that every time I will order food from zomato. Just try once. U will fall in love with zomato.,5
Very very poor service by team Zomato.. swiggy is much much batter.i strongly recommended swiggy. Zomato के भाव कुछ ज्यादा ही बढ़े हुए है। 2 पैसे की service Nahi hai।,1
Very very fast delivery and tasty foods thankyou so much,5
Most trusted food delivery app. Saying this because zomato's delivery valets have always helped me even though it meant extra work for them. Thankyou. Please always tip them.,5
very pathetic customer service. i ordered once and was talking to ragi the chat executive. she directly put me on hold for 15 min. and was not responding. Zomato has the refund policy because restaurant food alot of time are not what they promised.,1
good offers but the delivery time is too long and some orders got lost. Delivery process has to be improved.,3
They make sure the grand total is not less than 250 rupees even when one order single dish. Pro membership is again a sham to deceive the customer. Response to Zomato post below: W.r.t business sustainability: ought rightly declare all orders should be above Rs 300-350/. Also publish this details of minimum Rs300/ Oder value while u offer pro membership to all customers.,2
Order support system is to slow.. don't have value of customers and his money..,1
Very bad in terms of compensation or refund issue ..u end up stranded not having desired food quality and loss in both ways,1
They are charging more than the price as we visit the restaurants we are ordering from . Also they charge alot for taxes and delivery and then packaging .,2
"Smooth experience from order to delivery. However while ordering for others, option of providing their number to help in delivery not available",5
"It's good.but, it can be more user friendly,need some improvements.",3
I would say wonderful and best as compare to others like eazydiner and all...very easy to order and apply coupons if any....easy to order for dining and delivery both ....quick resolution of customer care if occurs.,5
"The food which was delivered, was not packed at all and anyone could have easily opened the lid do anything with the food item especially in such times of covid 19 scenario. Pathetic service 😡, very bad",1
It provides quick and safe delivery with great deals on most of the restaurants everytime.,5
I love Zomato its has a great offers and well packings with neat and good clean food wear all safety measures like mask helmet really appreciate i love Zomato,5
Bad service. Doesn't reply to support when needed.,1
"Zomato is perfect,,but restaurant capacity to deliver the food is the gut...depends on restaurant service amd packing.",4
Don't irritate with your notifications after force stopping the app.,1
"The food from here is spectacular. The thali is mind blowing. A good value for money place, must try! Highly recommended Food-5/5 Delivery-4.5/5",5
"This is good app with nice services, we have to chat with service provider in inconvinience, problem always have proper solution",5
Fantastic user friendly I used to be supporter of swiggy but now.lately swiggy become very commercial in.pricing they are charging more than restaurant price.he.ce I decided to order thru zomato.honest prices and good service,4
I was able to place the order. But it took very long time . Please improve the website speed.,1
Zomato take delivery charges but delivery is always late. Food always comes when it becomes cold and tasteless.,1
No offers and coupon... Location tracker is crazy,2
Good App with nice features n option for food.,5
Worst app......the promocode application option is always getting error and not able to apply Also the delivery is not quick,1
basically i can't give lesser than 1 star otherwise it would have been minus 5 on a 5 scale the worst service anyone can provide. being a professional worker I have to wait for my food for past 50 mins thanks to you zomato and this restaurant not to choose your service further.,1
It took 2 hours to get our food. Our food was ready for over 20 minutes before a second driver finally picked it up. The first driver never did. Terrible service.,1
All the options are well organized,4
"I ordered 350rs food. They deliver 200rs worth food and a missing food item. Next, they give you coupon of 150rs for missing food item. But here's the deal, I've to pay taxes and delivery charges again. So I ended up paying around 30rs extra. In total I paid 380rs for 350rs food. Nice scam you guys :) support was good, delivery boy was good, people involved seemed nice. But the underlying ethics is evil. Imagine income gains via this scam over scale with the customer base zomato has :)",1
"Absolutely horrible customer service!! If you can't understand serving a non veg dish instead of a vegetarian order is not OK, I don't want to order ever again from your app!",1
It is a very good app for ordering but if the confirmation police is changed it will be 5star,4
After placing order users comes to know that the restaurant is miles away and it will take more than an hour for delivery.,1
The customer support is one of the best assert of Zomato. They are very quick and responsive. I am regular user of Zomato.,5
Good service with the good delivery performance,4
Delivery charges are generally there even in pro membership snd the same are high too. Even membership seems to be a waist.,1
Made 2 orders today and both are delayed by more than 30 mins and Customer care is not at all helpful,2
Very bad app i have to spend a lot of time to order and delivery charges are too higher than the others really disappointed,1
Nice app. Good smooth UI and informative. Offers and customer service is awesome.,5
"Ordered lunch, waited half an hour and then they called and told me that they've misplaced my order and will have to cancel it. They immediately refunded my money, but I was left hungry. Scared to order again.",1
Order is always missing and customer support number forbtgw hotels are not working as well as Zomato chat support is worst and not responding.,1
Good app for getting food quickly and safely....,5
Very fast delivery and good food,5
One time pass word enterd in the App is very poor,4
This is a horrible experience of food delivery application. It doesn't deliver to most of places but gives a hope of making delivery possible till end moment,1
"Great application, enables me to access all restaurants nearby and order with decent discounts.",5
Fast delivered and delivery man good attitude and polite speech,5
If u eat out this is the best app as u get a lot of discounts and accepted at almost all the good places. I dont eat out much but still I saved a hell lot of money..,5
Most places are locked for orders below 250 to 300rs stating high demand.. and extra 40 delivery surge on orders below 250! even for mediocre restaurants.. seriously? I could walk into a nearby 5star hotel and order food with that money. If this pathetic condition continues food delivery services in India is gonna disappear.,1
No one available on the chat support for resolving mu issue. Have been waiting for a response since one hour. No option to call either,1
"The layout of the application is amazing, and there's a lot of restaurant choices to choose from.",5
worest experience with zomoto service. I was not getting the my order even this zomoto sent a msg to me your ordered was delivered at home and hope u r enjoying ur meals. Without recieving the food how can we enjoy. my bus time at 9:15pm and now it almost late eat. I was ordered almost 1hr:15mints completed.,1
Apps has been refined a lot since it's initial days.!,5
Any place food will recieved their fixation timing so good for zomoto,5
Messed up my order and not delivered it three times now so I suggest stay away from it. Customer care is also useless.,1
"Taking long time for delivery food which I don't think is good really disappointed, I think it take around 1 hour to delivered food",1
"Zomato has always been the best food partner with accurate information about food, delivery time, ratings, distances of restaurants and their trending dishes...",5
it is getting too much delivery charges day by day ..in Chennai selaiyur they are providing too much delivery charges and those restaurants are doing to much cheating with food.. Service is 2 worst from the Zomato..,2
Great app but these taxes are killing me I've ordered upto food worth of 500 rupees and almost ended up with 800 this really needs to change.,1
"The most recent update has application performance issues Would have given no star, if there was an option",1
Driver was so rude ! Behavior was definitely no manners.! And advice u to cancel the order. Service was definitely UNBELIEVABLE. So disappointed!,1
"Good service, before time order gets delivered. Delivery boy was looking very tired but still smiled and handed the order",5
Very best servics but food items are missings.,4
Had a bad experience in the past. But was immediately compensated a discount voucher for next order.,4
Very good. But need more chicken curry options in pune,5
They will cheat you when you receive a different product as they cannot do anything and there customer service sucks. I would rate a negative ratiing the way they resolve the issues. Never install it stupid service,1
The app is not refreshing its not showing all restaurants in between..there is a bug in the app.,1
Nice Service. Keep it up. Delivery charges may be waived off,5
Can order at anytime when ever u want this app is so amazing and brave full delivery person are so good,5
Always happy with app as well as service,5
Good food Delivery and Good preparation,5
Don't get fooled by offers like 40% or 50% as restuarant increases the price as per offers. I visited one restaurant having good rating on zomato but once i saw it i realised its fake rating created by them.,1
"The app shows item is delivered, even if there is no actual delivery of food. And one of the shittiest customer service ever.",1
Very good app for order food onine. I got shocked when zomato gives my ordered food before the time.,5
"I have order many time via visa card where zomato cashback applied but didnt received any , till day so many order i have placed please chaeck and resolve its again and again happening with me , Are you guys waiting for each time email",1
"VERY BAD SERVICE...LIKE 420 MY ORDER WAS CANCLED BY ZOMATO OR RESTORENT (FASSOS)BCOZ HE SAYS MY LOCATION IS NON DELIVERY AREA... BUT AFTER 1 HOUR I SEE MY ORDER WAS DELIVERD AND MY MONEY CAN'T REFUND...ZOMATO DOING FROUD BUT I HAVE SOME AVIDENCE AGENST ZOMATO I WILL FILE A CASE FROM CONSUMER COURT AND I will speak to my friends, my family and friends of my office and my relatives, you should speak to people you know and get this cheater zomato application downgraded RATING BAHUT MATTER KARTI H",1
Customer service is very good. My each an every issue was resolved with patients and given good services.,5
Customer support was not good My order is delayed but when I connect with customer support didn't get proper response,3
"Why do you even have ""cancel without refund"" option for Zomato pro? I accidentally pressed it while cancelling my Zomato Pro and wasted my 200rs for no reason. I'm just sticking to swiggy from now. I'm extremely disappointed",5
Excellent support and quick resolution. Food choices are also amazing.,5
So many years we are buying through Zomato and it was good but today I've ordered a food and it cost 142. We gave 500 rupees and he said he has no change so he asked extra 50 rupees and he gave us return 200 and he went. We are calling him to the number he contacted us for location first 3times he picked up and declined it and after that we can't contact him. pls Zomato because of some delivery person your identity is failing . I want the balance what he should give me I don't know I want.,1
"Liked the offers they recommend & the response is quite quick. Totally loved the app, it hepls & makes our work (tummy) easy!!",5
Isn't opening and again and again showing error while opening even after installing 3 times.. Havew no issues in Dineout or other apps,1
I like this app..and delivery time so fast.. thank you Zomato,5
Excellent and good service. They also accept cancel orders which is really great and appreciated.!!,5
It's good app for food ordering but cash on delivery not available anytime & sometimes delivery not available so please solve this issue,4
Horrible service.. they make us fool they are showing us another product n delivery something else which u can't even eat,1
"Wonderful experience till now. Liked it's service, discount & offers & app experience. Zomato pro is nice & cool to go with. Currently my No.1 food ordering app choice 😍",5
Delivery boys are being entusted with multiple orders. Its not only delay the order but also increse the risk of Covid.,1
Why is it mandatory to save the card details to make payments through credit / debit card.,2
Love the ease of use and offers that they have. Thanks for efficiently feeding me in the odd hours too.,5
It was amazing! Just need to develop real time tracking .,4
"They take ages to give you cash back and doesn't response properly, very very bad",1
"Very good, you have a great offer, you keep bringing similar offers, we will keep ordering ￼",5
"Very poorly managed the Operation when really needs the delivery @Corona time , #IPL Time",1
I wanted to change my order and Zomato gave me restaurant's number which was not working after all I had to cancel my order and payed around 100 rps for cancellation.,1
"Always problem with ordered food, if we order ghee rice no sides dhal will be missing, if we order veg Biryani raitha will be missing. You guys should educate delivery men's aswell, cross check order n see all the items are given by restaurant employees",2
I love this app so much i can't tell u in my words.. first of all the offers are outstanding and second thing this app provide u promo code also which i like a lot ....SO PLEASE DOWNLOAD THIS APP...🌸🌸,5
Very good experience because food is good and zomato always gives me offers.yum food and always helps me in any condition .,5
"The worst app for such an important service, i don't understand why they can't keep it simple and user friendly.",1
"It is utter shame that being such a recognized company the customer services are utmost laid back.. even being a PRO customer doesn't help in any way.. written numerous mails but all in vain. I would never ever recommend any of my relatives or friends to order from ZOMATO or even if by chance they do, to NOT subscribe to the unattended services and invite unnecessary trouble of get the order money stuck. This was utter disappointment and highly humiliating act of service offered from ZOMATO",1
They change potion size with reastraunts and then offer 50% discount. Also some times don't deliver and just refund money.,1
Customer support is very very bad no one responding your query....only one word they are saying we working on it but nothing totally worst.,1
"Amazing one stop app for all foodies like me.. love the pro offers, they do add lot of value for money thanks Zomato!!❤️",5
"Very bad service, can't even deliver the full order. And after say sorry.",1
I have an order one buy one get one icecream but I received only one when I try to chat with zomato they are told I have place only one order. Yes I am place oder but there was showing buy one get one free so where is my free one,1
We can't complain about the food. Worst app. They provide a email to complain to which they never respond.,1
"Wonderful experience...I don't know why some people do negative comments...but my experience for this app is really amazing, 😊😊😊😊",5
Excellent but once a time they missed my Oder and cannot return my money but over all excellent service.,5
Each experience has been good . Even when there was a delay there was prope4 communication and that's what I expect . Kudos,5
It's good but charges of delivery are entense and cannot be excluded but the delivery boy wears a mask and checks temperature . Its good,5
You should also give discount in COD. many of us don't use debit or credit card. Why you always prefer to give discount for card system. delivery charge and GST total 50/60 rupees extra?? I mean why ???? Please look after this,3
Extremely bad! The coupons don't work and the customer executives have 0 knowledge. All they say is uninstall and reinstall the app!,1
Non professional delivery services... Never be on time.. Vague answers by delivery person and customer service on app... Standard reply of apologising but no approach to solve the problem,1
Goodapp and awasome service. The service is good delivered hot food without any delay.,5
"Amazing, Very fast delivery I highly recommend it.",5
The app is not working. Keeps showing something went wrong for last half hour. Unable to plaxe an order.,1
"Very costly then swiggy and late delivery then shown time every time i order, but i am satisfied with swiggy coz cheap and fast.",1
"Ghatiya Services, delivery charges very high, order booked and confirmed, but Cancel without information.. Payment deducted.. Got refund.. Refund is not just solution..",1
Very bad Orders are always late Food is received cold and soggy,1
"Whenever I am out of town, Zomato makes me feel like I am always in my home and can order anything from my own Kitchen.",5
Excellent customer service and fast delivery,5
"Not more restaurant options like swiggy, price of the items seems to be high.",3
worst experience. improper pricing. more over I was member but the prices are more than normal.,1
I opted for on time or free delivery.After making late delivery they didn't return my money.worst and fake service.,1
Always preferred. Happy with service during these difficult days.,5
Its actually a good app their employees are making it more better today a delivery guy had a accident while delivering my food nd even after the accident he didn't gaved up it was a great inspiration for me by him that never give up,5
"Its charging more then 31% of total bill that only include delievery , really may the vendor what putting efforts to create even not, and cash back it didnt get even after delievery what the time lines , dothings in proper manner not just make every other person fool",1
When you can't show the right delivery time then just don't show! Thank you !,2
Food reached very late as per the estimated time due to which it was completely cold and dry. Reheating cheesy items makes it worse. So had to eat cold food,2
Ordered 2 ice creams (500ml) each. We got both ice creams weighing 286ml..this WITH the box . Had issues with this Baskin Robbin outlet previously for freezer burn in Ice Cream and old tasting Ice Cream. Thought to give it another chance and then this. I have pictures of the item. Cheating the public..not done!!,1
"Chutiya app,I was very hungry when I ordered my food ,it showed 15 minutes and it's now more than a hour couldn't get my order ,I am very very dissatisfied, disappointed with Zomato ,waste of time and my hungry ,it is better to get ourselves to get to restaurant and get food ,I am using Zomato more than two years now ,I have never had such an waste experience from Zomato",1
Every Delivery Takes 30-40 mins which is a pain. Even when the restaurant or shop is near to deliveey location still it's time consuming,4
Very bad service. Ordered food and waited 2 hours to receive the food. Such a waste,1
Too much buffering. Address not detectable by app. Payment gets stucks in between.,1
"ZOMATO - the new UI is horrible. On restaurant page, you can't see number of reviews. Is one step further down. No point of hiding that from the users!!!!",1
Could have provided options to select restaurants from food options .thanku but I absolutely love the service,5
I just simply love the User Interface of Zomato. It makes so easier for us to search anything.,5
Zomato provides a very good service to customers combined with exciting offers.I have used Zomato round the clock 24*7 turns very usefull.,5
Best app for ordering in food.... great discounts.. offers... and variety of food outlets to choose from.,5
I have ordered a veg pizza and a veg pasta. I have received only pizza with chicken and pasta is missing,1
Uncooked item received.. balance not refund and not help ..only chat boat options available not any agent transfer the call or chat ..very poor and wrost services..food quality received very poor,1
It's very good and a time saver app with best deals,5
"Excellent interface, very user friendly experience.",5
I would have given 5 star but at present Zomato is not accepting COD payment. Elder people who don't know net banking are facing challenges. My parents too. They need to depend on me for payment.,3
This app has very conjusted UI overall the app is good but it is difficult for senior citizens to use it.,5
Auto assigns address for delivery and does not have option to update immediately... pretty rubbish app...,1
Very interactive app! Lots of offer and discount on various shops. Very fulfilling experience 😍,5
Great services and on time delivery,4
I did not expected this kind of service from zomato. Few items were missing from my order and when I tried to reach the support they did not even responded.,1
"You guys just took my COD method, just becoz I cancelled my order, that's the most stupidest reasosn I've seen to cancel my payment method. I would just want to uninstall the app for such a rude behaviour by the customer service.",1
"Worst , its been an hour and still the app showing food is getting prepared. The worst experience i've ever had",1
Some food's quality is not good of some restaurants and the portion size is too small in some restaurants so u have to improve the food quality and quantity by saying them or guide them,2
Food was good but was order Jhol momo by call before order but received steam momo...still fyn...we enjoyed..because it's my husband birthday and don't wanna mess,5
I have had very good experience with Zomato recently so changing my rating. There has been significant improvement with respect to customer support rather customer delight.,4
Delivery service is available in my area 1year back but from 1year it was showing that it doesnt delivery in your area for every restaurant why did zomato doesnt delivers in my area now waste service and waste app,1
Good in delivering food and also app is now very convenient to use query solve very quickly.,5
Overall good experience.fastest delivery as per estimated time.keep up the work Zomato.😊😊 I don't agree with the others sending negative reviews.zomato is doing great and actually giving good offers n discounts. Vimal Hyderabad,5
One of the waste online food delivery app @zomato I was asking my refund from many days they said refunded given RRN number check at the bank but there is no transaction with tracking I'd they are not responding with my problem still now,1
"Not a good app, placed a order and not delivered food. And returning money after 7 days.",1
There is a bug in the app which shows the food delivered even if the delivery valet not nearthe destination. This causes confusion a lot,3
When guest waiting at home only 1 packet delivered rest 3 packets the delivery boy missed it and no response to my messages or calls. I had to go 5km in night to pick the food and no actions were taken by Zomato.,1
"Zomato Pro is useless, I bought it thinking I can get extra off , but it is only applicable to orders worth 300 or 500 or above, they are just making you buy more with less offer.If I want to order something worth less than 300 what is the use of this so called Zomato Pro",1
"Zomato delivery boys do not wear masks and zomato never takes a resolution for their costumers' problems. Swiggy is very much better, and the delivery of dominos is the best, and I would rate Zomato the worst",1
"Up to mark selection of restaurants, delivery on time and well behaved delivery boys are there .",5
It's been always worthy depending on zomato. Generally food reaches on time and follows the given instructions too,5
"They always want you to spend more when you ordering the food , by the excuse of ""We're are facing demand!"" . Even a person dont want to eat that much he will have to pay more or you cant order the food at all",1
Good app but some restaurant food is not good according to price like kamal restaurant Bahadurgarh haryana,4
Worst delivery service... they pin two three other orders with your order .. cold food will b received and you have to wait for 1hour to receive the order...,1
"Amazing experience, from great food to quick and fast delivery service. Excellent interface!",5
Customer Care is poor. Sending wrong items but no response. No quality checks on restaurants.,1
Very bad service or food are very expensive and not delivered on time. Always giving excuses. It's up to you use this app🤬,2
So much bad experience zomato..1 and 1/2 hour over then also order not deliver..money also not refunded..dnt order from zomato..,1
Easy and convenient. The listed restaurants must mention the quantity especially in the non vegetarian items in their menu,5
"problems: onion kulcha: was more naan with sprinkled onion on top mutton soup: did not send, said, ""aaj hum mutton nahi laate"" (why have it even in the menu?), sent chicken soup which was boiled chicken in warm water (no veggies, no spices, no accompanying sauces) (check photo) 20/- difference in the price of both and i didn't get even the refund. dum aloo: gravy has no taste at all.",1
"Doing good job in this critical situation, delivering food with safe and clean.",4
Food served was not hot and breads were hard. Didn't enjoyed my order from Om Sweets. Will avoid in future.,1
Everything else is well with Zomato but one is the major problem is order cancellation. Give your explanation about this comment.,5
Zomato is a really good app for ordering food and to explore restaurents around your city. Zomato also gives ratings. I have brought several other food item from hare,5
The app is not available in my location.My house is just 5kms from the city but in the app doesn't make necessary provisions to deliver in my area.,1
Fastest delivery... And just amazing service 🙂...👍,5
"Very Bad Experience If you pay online,you will remain insecure of delivery will be done or not,it might be that there wont be any ring to your phone and you will receive msg like sorry restaurant couldn't confirm order and you lost the money you trusted on Zomato Will not get any help If then also want to place order go for COD Only",1
Very fast delivery & good service,5
I have ordered my order at 8.30 I waited at till 9.50with out any reason.later I called to valet but he said that bike repair.later after 30min order is cancelled.now u tell me what the rating I have to give there is no food today at all,1
New delivery option is confusing. Get it at the restaurant should not be the default option.,4
Very horrible app...my order was declined and they didn't refunded my amount till date and no help from their so called customer support,1
"Great service, excellent delivery service. Just love it repeatedly.",5
"3rd class policies, item missing and they dnt have redelivery option, we are waiting for the food and after 1 hour they have refunded it",1
great app and delivery was fast and ratings of the restaurants was good and helpful to order food,5
Superb . Improved version. Discounts without subscription. Thank you.,5
Very bad experience in Zomato app. Some of Zomato delivery person cheating on by handle the product to customers. I'm going to uninstall Zomato app and install swigy or dunzo app are handling the product and good handle customer to delivery the product.,1
You guys are doing batch orders which is making us to carve for food. It's been 2 hours to deliver order. Rediculous,1
Don't book order from this app if you cancelled any item you can't get your refund. with me also same happened,1
Most of the times the order delivery is delayed. The worst part is that they justify it even without understanding the issue from the end user's point of view,2
snack shack mahanagar..awesome food with best price and good portions...specially the grilled items in chicken and fish are to die for. must visit place when u in lko,5
Delivery will be only till road. You have to go to Road and collect the order. This is what delivery executive informed me.,1
These people accept the order before and at the time of delivery they want us to come to a pick up point. Which is really nt a gesture of service. I ordered the pizza at Dominos with the Zomato app. But the dominos people talked to me in a rude way and they picked the called after three times I tried calling them. They are really nt professional. They literally a badass restaurant people. I would never suggest any one to order food from Dominos or zomato.,1
"Scam got charged twice on my account due to payment gateway issue , after consulting with customers service they advised that you need to wait for 2 weeks for a refund end up with out getting any food don't recommend to use this app at all.",1
Very nice service providing by zomato anytime.. But one suggestion for zomato need to do some changes in cancellation and refund policy..,5
"Awesome place to have delicious food served by young and handsome Chef. I love to eat again and again the mouth watering pizza Momo's, Peri peri Chaap, Tandoori Spring roll, kurkure Momo's. Highly recommended...",5
Very good service and needed timeline at anywhere and everywhere.,5
I am satisfied with the riders of Zomato but sometimes prices of food is more than they should be of.,4
It's nice experience in lockdown. You're giving door to door services in lockdown. Great work zomato team....,5
"Regarding customer service, very poor.. I am following up with them from 15 days, but no one responding.. every time they're replies to my mail, within 24 to 48 hrs issue will be resolved.. I am not getting, in view of Zomato, 24 to 48 hrs means..",1
Zomato is improving day by day bringing food in time so thats what impressed me about this app and this is their improvement,4
"Simply excellent, quite helpful in pendamic",5
Worst service. Its like taking Ola shared cab. The delivery guy will do lots of deliveey before you get yours. Expect wait time more than one hours,1
No Zomato seals and if we order from top most restaurant also the packaging is worst and restaurant logos also not there on covers .even if we write to your support also immediately you will ask for photos and you will refund 40rupees no action is taken,1
"Not perfect , sometimes you'll get stale food, be cautious.",4
Very easy to use... I've been using zamato for years now... Best in the business...thanks for memories 😁😁,5
"Love this aap. Simple , connected with all the restaurant,which makes very convenient for ordering food..",5
"The service has detiorated a lot, the order is delivered to some other person without verification. The standard of Zomato Valet has gone down.",1
Good delivery and delivery boys are so good and hardwork,5
Supar fast delivery and nice app interface,5
It's ok and delivery charges are costly.,2
App is not able to properly coordinated with restaurant...food was very bad unpacked and it was not my order without bill also,1
"I download Zomato today but now going to uninstall , Zomato don't take any attention on customer's complaint . And in the night orders they serve what ever they want , not what customer want , ghatiyaaa app.",1
This app is very helpful the food quality is good and the delivery is also on time,5
Cheating With Artificial Intelligence. Same items same place same time Have huge rate diff. As a regular patron & by rating higher for food items you get higher rates. That's a Good way to fleece people by mis-using Artificial Intelligence..,1
"Swiggy is better. Always whenever I compare the rates between Swiggy and Zomato, rates are always higher on Zomato and no discounts",1
I could not order because it was very defficult to use this app. Swiggy is easy to use I mostly use swiggy for food orders,1
"Food delivered on time, and we always have a quick response from customer service.",5
Their is no provision to restart on my new phone as my email ID is already registered and no provision for support,2
Zomato is charging extra money from us not the delivery charge or taxes it is about the item price.At the place item is of 270 and here it is of 400 without taxes and delivery charges or any thing it is the basic price and at the restaurant it is of 270 with all charges like taxes,1
I really don't understand it once I placed order and I need to change on it like they told me that it's buy 2 get 1 free still they don't give me and now told me it wont cancel the order I told it that you cancel and pay me back and I will reagain post my order but no....,1
"Pathetic service food reached in 45 mins exactly. Can't say anything to delivery boy after this new zomato issue going on. Just pathetic, last order forever. Super cold food less quantity. Just terrible.",1
Soon need food regulation act for food delivering partners. Food is too bad while ordering in online . Too much of hidden charges .. restaurant menu is entirely vary from zomato menu .. not worth for one star rating also,1
"Shoddy food experience is not redressed properly. Is Zomato about delivering a memorable experience or just a logistics company ferrying food from point A to point B? If it's the latter, I have other options to choose from!",1
"Great app, great food options and good service. Could improve adding the exact location",4
Food quality is good but delay as schedule time,4
"Dear Zomato, u r serving more than 200% of price only. u dont have best relationship with respective hotels. So most of the ordered food have very very worst and very very less qty. I think u may down ASAP.",1
Nice app but above 300 no cash on delivery it's Problem,4
Excellent UI and Seamless navigation of screens,5
Best app great discounts and easy to order. I can order for me and my family from different countries.,5
Not good at all. Never give a resolution. Customer support is a such a bad. Never use this app.,1
The process was smooth. Delivery was as per schedule & live tracking made it easier.,4
"Totally rubbish, many times i had faced issue with zomato, today also my order canceled my you guys after accepting the order and waiting for longtime.",1
Very helpful app....u can eat whatever u want from ur favourite place at ur most comfortable place that is ur Home...,5
Best app because the Restaurant options are wider in comparison with swiggy. I enjoyed it a lot.,5
"BS APP. DON'T Use. Paid and ordered Mcdonald burgers via zomato. Zomato boy waited 2 hours at Mcdonald but they kept saying order not showing. Obviously the THIRD CLASS APP made by unqualified idiots who open offices below bldg staircases. On concall with Mcdonald they failed to reinstate order and told me to use Mcdonald app. Then why would we need ZOMATO? I LEFT HUNGRY, FRUSTRATED AND ANGRY. HAVE CALL RECORDINGS AND CAN MAKE THEM INFAMOUS IN SM. JUST WAITING FOR ZOMATO RESPONSE FOR A DAY.",1
Very complicated app. How to order did not find option easily. Difficult to operate.,1
I think zomato people are out of the world . Their time is running very slow. For past 30 minutes its showing 12 minutes. Time even stops in zomato. Their valet doesnt even pick up the call. Horrible service.,2
No live chat available for wrong order / spoiled food spending lots of money on this platform... But poor service,1
Good experience with food delivery.,5
"The maine negative point of Zomato is, they charge more prices as compare to restaurants...if the price of food is 60 at restaurant... Zomato price is 90 or 100....this is very bad thing",1
Nice service but at this time I didn't use this service app not support my mobile phone n after installation it's not work properly,4
Food Items are missing in combo packs,3
Good but delivery charges very high side,4
Amazing app for food order .. sorting and filtration is great and also gives you great deals... Fantastic,5
"Fast delivery,& good stasty keep continue",5
Very bad experience. No customer care in India. Chat service do not reply on time. No tracking feature. worst experience!,1
"Dear Team, PFA I have recharge my Zomato Paytm wallet with 5100Rs/- on 09/03/2021 and my money was deducted from my SBI Credit Card ending with 4575. and it was not reflected in my Zomato Paytn wallet not reversed in my SBI card Request you to resolve my issue on priority and confirm. Other wise I will complaint to consumer court and ombasmand Thanks & Regards Abhijeet",1
"Superb app made my day, but wanna make a small update that we can do cash on delivery for max RS.1000",5
Worst app the time shown on the app and actual time of delivery is totally different and customer care representatives are illiterate don't know what they are talking,1
Payment failed many times and money does not refunded after 7 working days!!! I will not use this app anymore. Disappointed,1
good experience and fast delivery in time,5
"my amount got deducted, but order not placed. no signs where is my money. secondly refund was initiated to my upi account, but money did not receive. total amount rs 1800 is on hold from your end.",1
"Maintain single meal option separate tab, like previously",4
Far away delivery made quick and easy,5
food quality is decent. the portion sizes are quite good. Menu changes have happed post Covid.,5
"Order placed 90 mins ago and food not yet delivered. Expected delivery time reflected on app is 30mins but I'm STILL WAITING for my food. Everytime I order from Twigky, food is delivered LATE. I shall NEVER EVER order from here again",1
Less quality as compared to cost.if they have take delivery charges than they should send same quality and quantity of food..otherwise not bad ....,3
"Very good service,food is great...",5
I ordered something today and my item was missing.I tried to talk to the agent but the it is not opening .The service is very bad,1
I have faced this issue more than three times with in span of 4 months not delivering on time..,1
"I payed my order through Sodexo. But after food delivery, not able to add tip for the delivery guy. Always show change payment mode, inspite of selecting Paytm.",3
Nice but it increasing food rate Everyday when I ordered yesterday the Food rate was 150 and now 170 this is not fair,4
Nice my first order became successful but he didn't came to the exact location ok thanks,4
"Enjoyed Fast delivery and has a variety of food available there, with good food quality",5
app good but food come at home not good that much too costly for everthing and the offers are really off but the charges make that ofeer go far far away from the offers lol batter go and eat urself at hotel and rstrr,2
"Raised an issue in Support section, shared the image of the food which i had issue with, one of their support member named Priya reviewed it and didn't do anything... *slow claps* 😒",1
One of the worst food delivery app. Always there given estimated time is wrong that's why every time they are giving execuses but that execuses will not work every time. Pathetic service 😡,1
Worst app ever.. if you order a food which is worth of 100rs then they will charge 100rs as taxes and delivery charges which is worst.. very disappointed,1
"Its great app But the gift message option, did not give my message & if its a text, like common i can text myself😅its better if its handwritten",3
"Easy, fast and pleasing, rate little hither",4
In a way it is better than other online order apps like swiggy. Easy to use interface and great offers. Best delivery app ever,5
I am A pro in zomato i cant even get my delivey free for that but the order delivery time fast acco. To you but the time same with compired to normal then Why pro such a waste of money,1
"Very happy with it.. super user friendly, promt delivery and friendly staff.. my order was delivered 7mins earlier.. ☺️",5
Worst experience when it comes to delivery ! Delivery time keep extending if food its ordered on Sunday and you are not informed before placing order. Not going to order from Zomato again,2
This is a very user friendly app..never faced any problem till now.. I am using and ordering through this app now since many years..,5
"50% off should mean 50% off, not 100/- off or stuff like that. Its very misleading. PAYMENT NEVER HAPPENS STUPID HORRIBLE APP",1
Customer support is excellent.. They hear the issue details and refund the amount immediately.,5
Love the app as we can get all the restaurants on one app and it is totally great we can also get discounts on the ZOMATO.,5
Amazing app service is really nice comes in directed time,5
Delivering of food items in proper condition and with approppriate packaging should be taken care of.,3
Very late delivery..not acceptable..please improve your delivery system..I ordered my dish from BBQ nation..and it took more than one hour to deliver my order..,1
Tax and delivery charges should be standard. It changes as per your bill amount n also pro is not available on all the places. Don't understand their concept.,3
"Good application, but taxes and delivery charges are very high.",4
Prices shown on the app and the bill sent by the restaurant are by far too high.,3
Very worst service I got my oder in 1 hour .my oder was ready in 15 mints in restaurants but zomato delivery person came to me after 40 mints to pickup the order. No customer support from zomato....,1
"Very fast delivery app with live tracking,, just loved this app service,, happy to choose this app for food booking",5
Good but delivery time is alway 30 to 45 minutes late than the expected time every time please improve it Zomato,3
"Always a life savior, I just love this app evn exciting offers too ad always comes with good promo discount vouchers ❣🤞 my trippy partner ✌✌",5
Love this app! Quick delivery and hassle free payments. Highly recommend.,5
Nice app but takes some time to update our live tracking ... So 4 stars .. otherwise no problem😊,4
This app gives us a good and contactless service which is the most important in this pandemic .The food was really amazing,5
"The best food delivery app. Prompt services, great choices and great customer service.",5
Useless delivery charges even when subscription for Pro has been taken.,2
Worst app bcoz one parotto rate 23 🤨 it's too over I gave a 5 parrota for the money 150 it's too over the rate 😤,1
"UI too complex, other than that 5 star app",4
Zomato is live saving. And its user friendliness makes it easier to get a meal of your choice. Thank you zomato and team👍👍,5
Received cold food as the delivery person was assigned two deliveries. There was no provision to cancel the order with full refund. Pathetic service,1
"Superb app but delivery charges is very high as compared swiggy,only improve your delivery charges .",4
Best as always. The only thing that I can ask zomato is to expand more deliveries to other parts of dubai as well like areas close to production city,5
Its my go to app when I am hungry. Would be great if you offer bigger discounts for people who order more than15 times a month. Rest its all good.,5
"Its a experience to always order from Zomato... good quality,on time delivery, good customer service.",5
"Best app to order, with quick delivery time. Love this one absolutely.",5
"It was a multi stop order, so when my food got delivered, it was completely cold. Horrible service.",1
Very Good for food delivery and with very low cost prices than restraunts very happy with the app but not able apply codes in updated version,4
Wow wonderful was the product I reciebed from zomato. I wish zomato must be the no 1 app on all platforms for food ordering app Dil diya gallan Teri rehemato ka dariya sa re aam Brown munde In your eyes I know it hurts to smile But you try to You always try to hide the pain You always know what i dont say,5
"Sorry to say, my payment was debited for an order from Thaal Cochin today noon, but immediately Zomato cancelled it mentioning no delivery from restaurant to customer. I need the refund or the order made as soon.",1
Stop that money returning stuff if the dilevary person reaches late so that they shuldnt have to pay by their poket ... And if possible extend or manage the time according to the trafic timing like how google map tracks ..,1
"Price is too high these days, earlier I used to order frequently through Zomato and I used to get nice offers, now offers are Very limited , to avail offers we have to register to some unpopular apps which is very disappointing",2
The app takes too long to start and when choosing food the system gets stuck.,1
"Today again I ordered burgers from Burger king the distance from home to that restorent is about 4 km s however they took 48 minutes to deliver Sorry Team Zomato you have to learn from Swiggy, Dominos or KFC delivery teams. Does Zomato really delivers on time and serve hot food? answer is No Food quality is poor Comparatively swigy and uber It means there is no qualty mark standerd for food delivered by zomato.",1
"Zomato pro is cool, foodie like me has already saved around RS.4000 in 4 months. Their customer service is also better than swiggy(uninstalled now). Don't think if you are a regular in trying new bars n cafe's as savings are big",5
Super app to order food online. I could track the orders so easily . Loved it 😍,5
"It's amazing. Show real status like Order not eligible for Delivery, Cancellation by Vendor, Tracking.",5
Sometimes my money was stuck .and cant get them back.food may be high priced and not good.sometimes bad.please be alert,3
Very useful App. for the users. Excellent performance!,5
"Poor service quality, also after the case happened in Bengaluru it feels like there is no background check of the delivery boys they are hiring. Uninstalled",1
Pathetic experience. Worst food delivery app. Doesn't take any responsibility for customer concerns,1
"Sad, both money and food gone because i gave a wrong delivery address, though zomato has a option in that regard Prepaid orders are canceled without intimation to customer",1
very good food..spring roll r so yummy and crispy..packaging was also good and safe..delivery boy was helpfull and owner of this shop is good in communicating.everyone should have continue shop with Aggarwal sweets.,5
"Good value for money,service has been good so far,",5
I don't know why majority of the restaurants are not delivering in my area. Earlier every resturant was serviceable here.,2
Everything is very costly.. Zomato should at least decrease the prices or give promo codes every week Otherwise it's nice,4
I am not being able to access the zomato originals videos.... There is no tab for any kind of videos in my app... Otherwise it's great!,4
The experience has been good except no money has been refunded of failed transactions.kindlybrefund money for failed transactions. Honesty is required,3
I have reported 3 times food quality issue and no reply from anyone's agent . They disable chat agent also . Not good app order food bcoz they won't take customer feedbacks....,1
Good service delivery in given time,5
I have many order in this app.The app is one & only extraordinary fantastic app.,5
"Great offers and great service, what else does a customer needs. Loved the app",5
Choice of Wide range of Restaurants including budget ones. Lots of discounts. Buy their Gold Membership.,5
Very bad service I have ordered pizza from behala at 6:30 pm and it is came at 8 pm such a long time taken I am angry for so much late usually it takes 40 minutes to come... 😠,1
App is good but taking too much delivery charges bcs of delivery charges many times i cancel the order,1
Tasty food Good quality. Delivery system is very good.,5
"The delivery charges are high, which nearly takes the cost of the food.",2
"Zomato really love it...the best app in the world for me❤🔥awesome delivery,fast delivery, lots of offers......superb I really loved it...alwaz summa semma zomato❤👍💫😎",5
Food will never be delivered on time.. restaurant or zomato- nobody will take responsibility. And you will keep waiting for the food,1
Zomato is perfect food delivery app...I love using it ..it has so many offers for us ...I love Zomato ..thankyou for making my day...love you,5
Ordered like an hour ago... When it shows an eta of 30 minutes... Fun fact is that the eta dosent decrease with time.,1
"Today I have ordered Crispy chicken burger combo, but received only burger. Zomato accepted that they made a mistake. But after wasting 1hr 45 minutes Zomato is not able to give me a solution and at the last Zomato team is telling that the restaurant has delivered all the items but u r not accepting. I m not getting any options to paste pics & call recording. If anyone can help me with that I can paste all the details. The total cost for Pepsi & Fries is Rs 127.15 & Zomato is refunding Rs 100",1
"This time I had very bad service from zomato, for the 45 min but pizza not delivered, contacted zomato customer care chat but theyare not responding and just messaging to contact domino's branch for it..very bad on zomato",1
Excellent food on low cost..keep it up.,5
Guys ur app is crashing for me. Suddenly started happening now ie. 2:30 pm 03-23. Check ur DBs and microservices if all well,1
"I like Zomato very much,and I like ordering on this app regularly and Zomato makes life easy for me",5
I don't know why but from the past few days my Zomato isn't working properly when I am clicking the pay options it show error in showing and also closes the app.,1
Not happy with last minute cancellations of orders and then the money is refunded back after 7 days...that feels like a scam,1
"V poor customer care service.. Unable to reach them.. Items wer not delivered, when tried to reach cc received only computerized reply",1
The app is so good. Loved it. I use it every week. Makes meals time better ❤,5
"Dont use it on weekends some time wrong delivery and vallet will accepting to many orders at a time and our order will be late and cool, what is use to order from zomato",1
Intuitive UI. But could be more instructional to somehow lure the baby boomer generation to use it.,5
Worst experience I had... As I am trying to connect with an agent but there is no response.,1
It's nice app. Getting good service as well as getting nice discount everytime on ordered food,5
"An amazing app, very accessible to find restaurants nearby and very helpful in starving moments. 10/10 Experience",5
"Such a good app I have ordered many times, even one time also didn't get late ,super fast app",5
"Cheated me. I had renewed my membership for 2 years, and after one year Zomato membership stopped. Zomato customer care was explained everything and they told -will get back, but that never happened. It's complete wastage of health and money. When you have such apps u eat more, instead of healthy home food. Hence deleting this app, Zomato can keep my one year money, I am however disappointed. Will try swiggy for once in a while ordering.",1
I ordered first time today through Zomato however it was my worst experience. I would never recommend anyone to use this App. Thanks.,1
I have a issue with my order. I am on a chat with Geetanjali since the last 32 mins... She is extremely slow in responding and said she would conference my call with the hotel.. I am waiting since last 16 mins and have sent 7 messages but she has not yet responded back. Extremely disgusting service.,1
They are running a food scam in short . No proper way of complaining and your chat method is so slow and irritating I feel like smacking my phone talking to your executives,1
Great variety..and quick service...,4
"Customer support team is excellent,i had ordered some food from tacco bell even after providing cooking instructions telling not to give pajito beans they had delivered pajito beans ,when i spoke to Zomato team ,they intiated full refund which included delivery charges as well , Zomato cares its customers better than swiggy",5
Giving 5 star not because I'm impressed by this app technically but instead gave it because this service is giving employment to many needy young people who are working hard and getting paid by zomato. keep growing keep employing zomato,5
Did not receive the order even after following up with the executives and delivery boy for 1.5hrs. Just got an apology gift coupon at the end. Useless navigation and system,1
Worst app to order food. You will not receive the item you order. if you order veg you will receive non veg which means if you are vegetarian they will make you eat non veg.,1
Good and fast delivery very nice app,5
System ui is fab and functionality in map api sometimes it will not fetch the place and SEO shud be updated.,4
Very true it's delivery time. Good pakagings and tasty good foods. Very easy to place orders. Trustable.,5
Good but taxes are too high on ordering food,3
The discounts are pathetic...their customer service is a joke..their app dosent work..the chat option dosent work...swiggy is way better,1
I am trying to contact customer support from yesterday still not able to contact...there is always problem with customer support..my refund is still not initiated.,1
Zomato increases the prices than what is present on the menu in original restaurant. I can provide the screenshots but no option available.,1
"After looking ads about 50% off for first 5 orders, I installed the app but didn't got any discount coupon. Disappointed☹",1
YOU LOSE MONEY on this app Guys...beware...this app have no cancellation...they make u enroll into no otp and there is no reconfirmation on orders. So food will be forced on your throat. I've complete history of this trick. DO NO USE.,1
Team you really need to update your 'Write A Review' section. It is not at all user-friendly. Neither on the app nor on the website.,3
Serious problem with live tracking..even the food is delivered its shows the delivery agent is still in restaurant..,4
"They are the best for food, they are way better than swiggy. I always order my food from zomato and they always delivered in time .",5
Very Nice application. Easy to navigate,5
"Easy ,and user frindly app which keep your hunger level on",4
Very bad coordination between zomato and burger king. You ask for a particular item and they send you wrong item food.,1
"Worst app, playing with customer's money and patience. I never install zomato again. Thank you for the experiences that you have given instead of food! Swiggy better than you. It's better to shut down the company.",1
Very user friendly. Good variety of foods I liked the service. Best wishes to their team,5
App service is worst. Now it has disqble typing in support l. How yhe hell customer will comtatact support. Please try other apps.,1
"Zomato as expected is amazing. I would really love to work in this company someday. It is amazing, creative. Their delivery rule of within time is just mind blowing. Thank you zomato for making bachelor life more happy.",5
Pathetic customer support. Delivered cold order and customer service person kept me waiting and gave no response. Absolute disgrace. Worst exp. And they haven't changed. One executive carrying 2-3 orders and delivering cold food! They are a disgrace to humanity.i placed order by mistake and requested to canceled it immediately. Their bots said cancellation fees n all. Only bots. Cheapest app on planet earth.,1
User friendly app ...easy to choose from the menu .... Hassle free ... quick delivery as well 👍👌,5
So far Zomato has improved form couple of years...not bad it's okay to use services...but the offer's which advisement's show will be not applicable for all the customer's this is unfair,3
Everything is fine..if you can share location of the restaurant it would be great because we get cold food because of the distance.,5
Application is not working in my mobile. When i tried to open its showing unfortunetly stopped. Kindly rectify it soon,1
The charges for delivery are too much...this is ridiculous. So many peoples complained about this problem but you are still doing this ?,1
Very fast and contactless delivery.,5
"Good app and work must be given 5 star, but one or two bad experience may make it 4.waiting eagerly to give5",4
these guys are not even checking the orders and they are still delivering wrong products...committing same mistakes with same orders.. apart from that they are giving a strong orders base disorders worst application. Swiggy is much better,1
"They never refund your money. They keep giving excuses that system issue. 3months later, they decided to never refund money they owe",1
Worst experiences from time to time given by zomato to me.. now I use this only when I have no other option and it's rarely the case now,1
"I did not get money of discount or sometimes promocode does not applied due to technical issues , kindly do some corrections .",1
0 rating Cant take cash on delivery above 750 and cant do another item from another restaurant above 350 cod and it says yoy cant order on cod.dont download it is waste of time.dont download it.,1
Easy to use. Customer care is extremely supportive.,5
Very Good Tasty 😋 And Healthy Food Always On Time.🤗,5
this app shows only 1 restaurant around me why whats the problem..nearly 90 above restaurants showed in the past what happens,1
Realy bad gesture from Zomato... should give the job back.. otherwise he won't be able to work in any platform like urs... uninstall is the option left for Zomato....bring back the guy and work in favour of the delivery boy...they work fr u ...care for them,1
"Best Reastaurant in THANE..It’s a great experience. The ambiance is very welcoming and charming. Amazing wines, food and service. Staff are extremely knowledgeable and make great recommendations.",5
The application is repeatedly crashing on Oneplus 7 pro since the last update. Please fix.,2
Very nice and quick delivery 👌...I like it...delivery boy also great and decent person...thanks zomato...in this covid pandemic days also u doing very great job,5
"Great service ,very fast, my order came earlier than the delivery time . 👍",5
Worst experinece. Order came after one hour and that too very old.. I will never use Zomato for food now.,1
Excellent App...My experience of zomato is excellent from the past 4 years. It's been four years that i am using Zomato App,5
First I love the app and services before...but now they have increases the tax...it's very very too much,5
The best food ordering app with easy user interface and user friendly.,5
"Worst service, Since at a time multiple orders are given to single delivery boy and much of time taken. Very poor service",1
This app is very impressive but But every time when I order food update option comes but this app is very good,5
Overall good. Swiggy tracking is better as tracking can be detached from the app and visible separately,4
Good. But pls remove limitations for cash on delivery. Always keep the cash on delivery option available.,4
Very good coverage and huge selection of restaurants. Very good service.,5
favourite food with mind-blowing offers... enjoy all tastes by ordering from all varieties of hotels n restaurants One thing is making delivery charges a lot,5
This is very pathetic food delivery services i ever seen restaurant are doing malpractice of ignoring food quality standards They ignoring customers problems Dont responds customers problems Just say revert with 24 to 48 hrs I hate this app,1
"Very easy to use, time shown for delivery is appropriate, overall app is very good!",5
Best application for ordering food and to satiate the hunger... Little bit work required in communication system with the customer support...,5
The app is good and they have timing responsiblity of the customers and lighting fast delivery,5
I got incorrect order. My refund was initiated and I didn't get my money back even after 8 days. Even I'm not able to contact agent,1
Cheap .......and ripp off with no skills of understanding and customer service which is designed especially to use against customers.....rules which are only fair for zomato....,1
Third Class App...i dont know why suddenly the app started saying that in every restaurant that i am not able to apply promocode...,1
Absolutely Speechless and the delivery boy is outstanding,5
Their customer service is awful. And the information about delivery time is always misleading,1
There are lot of spillage issue...they crush the order n get to us .....if we contact them they'll be like we'll set we'll make sure ur experience is better n that's all what about our food gone that's all ....bad delivery app ...swiggy is far far better than Zomato,1
I have just downloaded this app and I have ordered food. Your delivery is best. Give ads on T.V and please increase the salary of deliver man.,5
Great app. Timing is very good excellent 🙂,5
The food was delicious 😋 Menu is perfect. Service was awesome. Will be back definitely! 🤗,5
Wonderful app just one suggestion i.e it would be nice if zomato had done COD order of above 750 rupees,5
Worst customer support service Wanted to cancel my order since I selected a wrong delivery address by mistake Informed the chat support within 60 seconds They still took 15 mins for the process and deducted 50 rs unnecessarily Swiggy offers free cancelation within 60 seconds,1
Delivery charges are more . Rates are doubled . Emergency time good for ordering food .,1
Always pick wrong location. Delivery guy find it difficult to reach place and ask for extra charges,1
Well this could depend on location but pathetic service there is no quality control for restaurant listing. Recommending Swiggy,5
"So courteous , friendly and punctual",5
For elderly people bit unfriendly . Also cash payment option is a challenge to manage.,4
"If we can order on any restraunt ,rider can check order nd taste it after they delivered. Don't order ever on zomato",1
Very user friendly app...Easy to use..never cancle their order....Superb app for fastest food delivery..strongly recommend 👌,5
"Clever people, they increase over regular price of restrurent like checked with KFC, then add distance charges and even if they give offer discounts it will always more than base rate...",1
I had a wrong delivery and afterwards I'm stuck in this loop with the customer care...I am very uoset with this type of behaviour from their customer care....They kept me on hold for more than 40 minutes....and still my issue is not resolved,1
"Best application for online food delivery, also deliver boys and their timing are perfect at any wether condition",5
It's good app for eating foods and it have many offers and it have high quality foods quick delivery service and superb satisfaction,5
Easy and delightful to use. Lots of choices and offers.,5
Rates are altered for Zomato gold and Zomato customers as compared to Restaurant's Price. ALSO delivery Charges are high. Feels I wasted my bucks in buying Zomato Gold membership.,3
Worst... Every time I order through this app and always got delayed delivery. Chat support is use less,1
Non reliable ratings Delivery time is always wrong. Most of the times it is delayed Pathetic customer service in case your order is delayed or delivered wrong order,3
Zomato food delivery service is decent and very promising. Its the restaurants that are very greedy restraining to insane prices and people keep tossing tomatoes at zomato for all the idiotic mistakes of the restaurant...,4
"Fake offers, whenever I use any coupon I didn't received specified cashback. Also it shows inflated prices, I think swiggy is better than Zomato.",1
"Very bad service...they are charging extra 80 rupee to deliver the food....and on call they told me to if you,ll not pay..we,ll cancell the order..all conversation hd done with Anne bakery (Fazilka) punjab..",1
"5 star, Becouse zomato delevery is so fast, secure, and testy food provide and then swiggy so costly online food charge,late service and not to good quality food. I happy for zomato app for 100 rs discount every take food order.",5
Good service.I observe that its well managed. Please open a window to cancel the order given by mistake.,4
Worst app ever. They deliver wrong order and don't bother to address your issues,1
I cancelled 1 order n that too 1 year ago n still my COD mode of payment is blocked and after sending mails n reporting this issue in the app still they have not fixed this .,2
It's not good I had order 40 minutes before and than after 40 minute zamato person delivery on location so my pizza will arrive around 1 hours and 20 minutes. After but so this is not good what is the services zamato amazing👏🏻👏👏🧐😒,1
"Excellent, fast and safe service",5
Very user friendly. Fast app.,5
Now a days they are not very accurate and it's hard to deal with them!!!,1
"Can't even cancel any order. This is the first time I'm experiencing something like this. Being a growing brand in India, they don't have an option to cancel any order. This is pathetic. I usually don't complain about things, but this just changed my mood !",1
very very very excellent app for ordering food and booking places.... highly recommend you to order,5
Should add more joints and be # 1 in the country for delivering everything and anything related to taste n food... Keep going. 5 Star.. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,5
Easy to use and tracking of order online is also perfect. Behaviour of all Valet found very polite.. Keep it up,5
Please remove the feature 'On time or free' This makes the delivery executives rush to get an order delivered which might lead into an accident/life threatening situation for them.,1
The support system is bad There are not response to chat system,1
"One of the Best Restaurants in city. Value for money, awesome taste and lovely services. Eager to visit it again and again",5
"Zomato offers are very good sometimes. Add on few more hotels, which we get on zomato",4
We don't get dishes on cheap rates. 90% of the time the food we get is awful.,1
Even taking Zomato PRO or premium it's Expensive and Not worth to what u r spending.. Disappointed,1
Hopeless service from the team. Support team provides no support at all. Received incorrect items many times.,5
The restaurant price in both swiggy and Zomato are same but when it comes to delevary in swiggy 1chicken biryani half is 120 by delivary charges 178 in Zomato it was 120 after delevary charges apply it's 165 both are same food same restuarant bit delevary charges are low in Zomato so I love 💕 zomato,5
The food does not reach in time anytime and the time is stopped in the app.,1
"Didn't allow me to apply discounts. Delivery charges were not applicable, still I was charged for delivery.",3
"The most easy , safe , convenient food delivery experience .",5
Delivery is always on the given time and sometimes it comes before the end of the time 😇😇just love it and nature of delivery man is awesome and Polite 😇😇Must try it once,5
Terrible experience.There is no vallet but they expect us to complain against the food quality when in reality food gets spoiled due to delay in delivery.But zomato will not issue refund nor accept their mistake,1
Good restaurants. Good service. No complaints. The valets are well behaved. Reach in time.,5
The new version is much better than previous one. I am satisfied by delivery and quality of food.,4
It is nice app with an interesting feature that every time send us fresh food and at everywhere at everytime,5
Good app with lot of restaurants but little expensive on delivery charges while ordering almost daily,4
Great app for food delivery and I always find great coupon code and trust me this is an party saver 🥂,5
I don't like there food stuff no refund policy very bad service.... Never use this app,1
Very bad customer service. They cancelled the order without informing and customer support guy disconnected the call while speaking.,1
Good but they charge so much extra in many ways that sometime I wish to kick these app for making us so lazy in the name of convenience.,3
Fast delievery in 30 mins must try this app but some food items are missing so that's why I'm giving 4 stars,4
The service has gone bad in last few months. The customer service works like a bot even for Pro members.,2
Very much useful for the needy but the delivery boy must have maintained some discipline in clothing and uniform,5
Very nice app which gives best output everytime..,5
"Offers r great but not safe for family's ,womens, girls ,kids we can't risk our family for ease of ordering food,things like this happen when u guys hire without proper guidelines",1
Lately it wont operate properly system is so slow trying to place orden from 2hr it finally places but still app doesn't run properly,3
This app is really helpful sometimes and also perfect for ordering food online.,5
Cant see the panel for order processing & maps..issue occurred only after new update.. before it was fine,3
Great! User friendly ! Good range and variety to choose from.,5
Which is one of the worst delivery app which didn't have serving hotel numbers with them and the quantity and quality is very worst,1
"the owner and staff service is quite good, loved the chocolate waffle, it is a must try. Overall wonderful experience",5
Third class app. I didnot receive food after the payment was done and also no refund was done. Worst experience.,1
"Tamilnadu Trichy Service are very poor, Please aware that delivery time what they are showing is not correct they took double the amount of time...",1
Service is very good. So far I did not have any problems with Zomato. It's very good.,5
Love this app. Sometimes I feel that delivery charges are high eventhough restaurant is nearby.,5
thanks a lot to Zomato...im feeling it like a mother especially when it's delivering food in odd times...thank you Zomato♥️,5
Very bad service..ordered 2 item but they delivered only 1 without refund. even no one is there for support.very pathetic service.,1
It takes them half an hour to assign a delivery agent. Pathetic app. No cancellation option,1
When I order from KFC through this app. The delivery was too late. And there was one item missing from the list. Now I am waiting for it come................... after too many messages and calls. Still waiting.,1
"Very careless no response from Zomato after putting photographs of Misplaced order from Cream stone Kompally.. They have send plane Chocolava Ice cream without any toppings of gems, fudge, Choco sticks are missing. Absolutely cheating from Creamstone, zomato on this issue. No response till now.",1
Charges packaging charges when there is none. Charges taxes arbitrarily when restaurant prices are already inclusive of taxes.,1
"You should stress, enquire and confirm about the cooking orders also. One thing is, your delivery person should enquire wether the cooking instructions followed or not with the restaurant before taking the parcel.",2
Completely satisfied. One thing I love about Zomato is the quick response from the support team.,5
Nice app . Everything is good at these app but delivery charges are very high .,4
Never get a proper resolution from customer service. No one reads instructions. Never get the refund in codes added to the account.,1
Good food and timely delivery,5
"Good, need to simplify menu style",4
There was meals for one option now it is not in the new update that is why rating is low add it again if u want 5 star,1
Taxes and charges bhut jyada lete Hain. It's depends on its own wish. useless charges added which not required because distance is not much.like delivery charges I m not satisfied,1
"Not genuine, delivery time increasing is increasing after order placing, not delivering on time",1
"The delivery boy cancelled the order without even calling once.It was prepaid,he was the only one available for contact.I don't want to pay for delivery boy's food no more.Over!",1
"Well and good service,fast delivery.",5
Best available app for food delivery. Various choices of outlets available for each food dishes.,4
Initially said refund for cancellation of pro membership but now saying no refund... worst app...I'll give 1 rating for every order that I placed from now onwards..,1
Atleast act on complaints made by customer. Ready made questions to raise a complaint so that there were less issues what a brilliant method.,1
My first order was nice but in my todays order no 349892 I have received wrong and missing item. No is responding on chat. Pathetic service.,1
waste of money and time. never use this app. No improvement in service. Tied up with worst restaurants,1
"Amazing experience every time. Delicious meat cuts, Appetizers & sushi, super friendly staff & outdoor seating is lovely",5
"Bad customer service. They do not listen to your complaints. All they say is ""we will share stern feedback with the restaturant"" and thats it.",1
So long delivary time. Food quantity and quality issue mostly so less no action or follow up system.,1
Zomatao is excellent but little expensive but it deserves because delivery charge and little bit earning,4
Good food.. delivery timing is also good,4
Best app. For home delivery for pipeing hot food,5
This app is not responding properly.i order 9 veg puff but that bakery not available so I am not interested to buy other.so I ask to refund my money.more then 10 days I am not recieved my money back.so this really un satisfied use this app.,1
Worst app. U will never get food ontime. U will receive order after getting fed-up with their service.,1
"Currently, zomato services are worst. They are extracting so much money on the name of taxes, delivery charge and surge charge. For an order of 100 rs, we need to pay around 180 rs. Also, at the restaurent, same food is available at 80 rs only. Worst ever services. Guys, go to restaurents by walk and eat peacefully, rather ordering from zomato.",1
I love this app but some time app crashes thats painful for me,4
nice delivery methods and the employes were also good and i liked this app and uses it everytime when to order food,5
Nice UI and simple yet powerful experience,5
"Won't recognise you after your food is delivered , won't help you in any way , I ordered food but it tasted really bad , they didn't do anything about it above that the food's colour was different than the picture , this app should be cancelled already.",1
"System fault, order canceled without any information, and they are asking for place and order again,",1
"Service has become extremely bad in the past few months. Too much delay, cancelled orders etc",2
Its good but many things is not there for delivery But just loved the taste of each and everything that i have booked 😍😘,4
This app is really helpful for me...I can easily order food and they are really safety conscious... I love Zomato,4
Worst Zomato app I ordered food but 3hours over not delivered and I can't able to contact customer service for refund because there is no option to connect them what the worst app is this and delivery boys are also worst,1
"Very bad experience with ZOMATO, i have order many times order with different date zomato delivery boys has been cancelled my order without my confirmation and he was don't contact me...and also Customer care number not available and chatting help desk service is very bad.. i don't preferred anyone to take ZOMATO service and install this app.",1
Restaurant may be forgot to give best service sometimes. But zomato service truly best. Zomato care for customer 120℅. Thanks a lot Zomato team management & wishing you all happy holi.,5
Don't have any control on the restaurants and how they maintain its recommend to buy from Zomato until you don't have options...,1
"Timely and safe delivery, thanks zomato to deliver whatever we want in this pandemic.",5
"Every experience with zomato is different, its all depends on your valet. So far 3/5 on my side as delivery and handling. Also I request zomato to choose your restaurants after adequate health checks not because they willing to join zomato.",3
"What the hell is wrong with your app, whenever I choose the payment mode it shows an error. I will never install this useless app again😠😠😠",1
One time delivery speed booking order.. Few discounts if they add more coupons or discounts then it is very good compare with swiggy,5
Very fast delivery fast than swiggy and uber eats Offers are more than swiggy Every time new offer just one suggestion please add beverages section to it,4
"Worst service, I had ordered 3 items from kargeens restaurant on 25th feb but I received only two items but i had paid for 3. The zomato customer care promised me to refund an amount of ₹230 within 4-7 days but it has been 20 days now. They're not at all bothered to look into our problems and refund the money. I've been trying everyday but nobody responds. This is the worst app I've ever come across. I was in a dire emergency for food but I neither received the food nor got refunded.",1
Very late delivery....always...better we order directly cos order routed through zomato takes more than usual.,1
Worst app with worst customer service and worst delivery people . Order only if you have spare time and money to waste,1
"Amazing, fast and reasonable priced",5
Was 5 stars until few months ago but now charging heavy taxes and delivery charges. Worst uninstall it,1
I don't think this app is worth to use as it is not showing single restaurants which is delivering at my location and app is showing that we are delivering,1
Worst feeling because I thought there's free delivery as it was there for pro members but when I renewed my pro membership it stated that delivery charges are applied.. not expecting this from zomato...,1
UX is too cumbersome and confusing,3
I don't want to even rate irresponsible behaviour the amount was deducted from my account u people said it will be refunded now it's almost 10days the response the payment was failed from my side if the payment was failed from my side why will I wait for refund,1
They charge more than double price as per restaurant menu..better to go on restaurant for lunch or dinner ..delivery boys polite in my area.,1
High Delivery charge..And Take more time for delivery...And Food price in zomato app more than hotel price...,1
Sometimes it provides different and actual food or order. But service team gives proper follow ups.,4
Very nice... Payment failure sometimes.... Which should be solved soon.,5
We never received our order.. but it changed t delivered after 3 hours after I placed the order.. no customer professional helped me.. I am out more than 800 rs without any food received,1
Bug in offer with McDonald order above 199 and get free Mc Veggie Burger. I am charged cancellation fees for Zomato's mistake. Very disappointing experience with Zomato.,1
Great app to order food online and good delivery services. Have good offers sometimes.,5
"Can't cancel an order, there must be an option to cancel it within 2 minutes.",1
App is good but try to make more discounts excluding delivery charges.. Ppl will order more...,3
"Your valet delivering, your showing 3 minutes to arrive. No synchronisation with valet travel in graph. Please update. It happened earlier also.",3
"Excellent mind blowing service,thanks zomato, delivery boy also decent",5
Best app with best delivery and more quickly delivered worthy for money. Best food with quality provided,5
Very bad service....I havnt received my order and also paid before order but zomato showing order is delivered..I lost my money and not received my order...,1
It's always lovely and fast work . And best thing is offeres available here .,5
"Nice service, Delivered in time & safely",5
Worst service when the time of booking time shows 20-25 minutes but after booking it shows 40 minutes..,2
No refund options and support can't help to resolve the reported issues. No callback option also.,1
The customer care executives and the delivery boys are very much good and the food quantity and quality is pretty good,5
Superb app. .Great deals on Food delivery.... Quick service.. reliable customer support. They do respect their customers. Thanks Zomato😊😊,5
WORST SERVICE EVER!!! I literally had to wait for almost 2 hours yesterday after placing the order after which they cancelled my order. Uninstalling the app right now.,1
worst app ever i placed a order after successful payment it displayed that restaurant canceled the order now worst part is zomato app don't even display my order in history and custom care telling me that i don't even order anything as a software engineer i can say zomato is worst in handling payment failure and logs handling,1
Well gives option to have good food from nice restaurant to destination,4
Pathetic customer and delivery experience. Swiggy by far is the best. Would recommend uninstalling this app. No courtesy and fraudulent activities everytime.,1
"Worst experience, they are delivering the proper order,infact items ordered are missing, in turn no refund,no response, from staff they are cheating with costumers",1
"All the cheap roadside restaurants are registered with Zomato. The taxes are too high. Double taxation. Screwing the public. For Rs.1800/- food, Rs.480/- extra tax for delivery. The Food bill is inclusive of tax. Then what is the other tax ? Gabbar Singh tax !. What is the TAX MAN doing? Watching the dacoits ? Swiggys is better. The on time or free is a gimmick. There is no response. When a lady stood up to claim her right , Zomato sent rowdies to break her nose. Modi Ka India !!! Jai ho !",1
The menus in your app are not correct. Eg Tic Tac is famous for the rolls. But don't show on your menu.,5
The ARRIVAL TIME is inconsistent. When I placed the order it time was 35Min after a while it showed 41Min,2
"Not just sometimes, but all the time when i order food, i get fully satisfied with zomato service, i dont knw bout the owner but m sure zomato hv the best supporting team with them, thanks for such app, makes our job easier",5
"Good but needs improvement, especially on COOKING INSTRUCTIONS 😡😡😡 !!!",4
Good service most of the time...high delivery charges especially for low budget customer,3
I just loveee this app. It works wonderful and nvr hangs... The foodstuffs are just awesome. You must try this app...😊😋,5
"I was ordering for first time ,I had a free delivery and welcome offer ... I ordered and order was cancelled by the shop ... I lost my free delivery and packaging offer .",1
Too bad services and waste of time and waste of money and the service is not good.Agents are not responding properly and they didn't satisfy the customers,1
gelato was nice. kinder surprise was a little sweet for my liking but green tea and vanilla was good.,5
Pathetic services . Customer care & delivery person will switch off their nunber after they pick up your order from restuarent. After my comment i request google to delete such app from playstore. They are doing fraud.sunder pachai kindly remove this app from app store.,1
Very disappointed After waited an hour of food order get cancelled at 11:45pm now all restaurants are closed. Now there is no option to have dinner because of Zomato,1
"There is no good customer care service. Whenever I place an order, my order is not correct.My food missing in what I ordered.There is no report of my order, who do I have",1
Delivery can not be tracked .They are always late and don't have the courtesy to pick up calls,4
Previously it is average.but now it's service is very good..but the delivery time should be change ..I mean quick...tnq,5
"They have fixed issues with the app, a lot more streamlined. Zomato Pro is even better!",5
No much option for restaurants and delayed deliveries. Few Restaurants are available only after 5:00 pm,1
No words to describe!!! Zomato been there for me when needed the most. Keep up the good work!!!!!!!!!,5
The invoice copy was torn. But Food was deivered in time and the packing was intact.,4
Worst app ever seen and the customer service is ridiculous. They stop responding to us without resolution.,1
Isn't it possible to order food worth more than ₹350 by Cash on Delivery mode? I mean seriously!,3
Awesome Changes .. Great Interface .. And Secured Payment Transaction .. Back to Zomato been away for a Year .. it Feels Good and Satified I just Too A Pro Members-Ship Now.. Kudos !! 🤗 🤩,5
The chat proscess or whatever the services are they all are fake just sended message and not replying waited for 10 minutes to see reply but no one is available,1
It's awesome app. It is fast delivery and foods are fresh.,5
Discounts are hard to get also prices are higher than usual market price .,1
I dont know why this app is because because many of the best restaurent aren't accepting orders please make sure that many restaurent accepting orders,3
Superb quality and excellent service and work,5
"Awesome service!! No delay, fresh food, excellent packaging.. Thumbs up!!! Good job",5
Would have given 5 star if the online payment works fine Better deals and almost all restaurants are available at finger tip,3
Zomato Rates are at higher side than hotel menucard actual rates. Dont order anything from zomato. Instead call directly on hotel number and order.,1
"I can say one thing about Zomato "" Really a Sukh Dukh ka Sathi😄"" 5 stars. Impressed by offers as well which were not there earlier. Thanks",5
"Poor customer support. If we sent one message, reply will be given after half an hour.",1
wide range of cuisines at fingertips and brilliant network. however not too happy with the loyalty discounts.,5
Night 11:15 I was hungry... No vehicle is there for me... Soo I go for swiggy it is not available to deliver food @my location and then zomato wow delivered food @11:45. Thank you zomato,5
I feel the delivery is a bit overpriced but looking what happened with Uber & other such apps I think they have to keep this pricing to survive in the market,4
Really bad first they delivered wrong product and when complained they kept on saying that they have delivered right. When finally i called for compensation they deducted money from my account,1
Easy to get food quickly with best offers.Nice patience and polite behaviour of staffs...,5
Amazing app. Their report food feature saves my day if I receive something not up to the mark.,5
The service by Zomato is very good. But the price increases quite a lot when you order something from Zomato.,4
What need ato be done for error. Something went wrong. Have already cleared cache data and uninstall install the app,1
Works every time I am hungry. Love the wide spread in food as well as payment options.,5
Too much delivery charge also the prices are higher than what you get if you directly contact to the restaurant,1
"Overall Great Usability, and good job it has been nice experience and found no issue yet.",4
Good service and packing...... Some products prices are high the can be reduced.,4
"Zomato service is very bad they are not help the customer for any issue if the customer is and in membership there is no discount or promo just making customer fool and nothing , if u can do anything for customers so please provide the service like AMAZON , if we messaging them for any issue they are say we are getting high flow of queries ...... So what u help the customer if they are getting problem they are not asking for the picture or the issue just they are sending this lines 😠😠😠😠😠😠",1
Live tracking is not up to the mark..i cnt see till where my order reached..it shows on the pick up location only,4
"Thank you for making our life easy. Thank you for timely delivery. But will never mind if it will be late by few minutes. Because we are living in India where traffic is the top issue . Thank you again Zomato. And thanks to the delivery boy for following all norms of Covid 19 and contact less delivery. Thanks for the right approach you have shown in Bangluru case, firmly stand with your employees when they are right. Thanks 😊",5
"Fast delivery, polite attitude and comfortable app",5
Unable write feedback and submit after the delivery in Zomato app..It should be fixed soon..,3
Not happy. Increases the prices and minimum order during lockdown. Just exploiting the situation.,1
Omg the attitude of the delivery boys was hell.im really freaked out.3 times my orders was canceled only for delivery boys and they behave like a king of all india .we r customers and your app only working because we use . but see your delivery boys 1st don't make us angry. I really need to said they have really bed attitude.,1
"Great and when I used this app, only 2-4 transactions failed. The rest, proceed",5
A must vist place ! you should definitely try out their fishfood ! The authenticity of the food and the flavours just melts and the food is way next level ! feels home😍,5
I mean honestly....only app that returns money if order is faulty...a very good customer service and descent food....affordable price...love the app,5
Always late with the delivery.Says in 10 mts and order will come after 40 mts.I am giving my option after checking multiple times,2
"very nice service.better than other delivery platforms. Delivery boy was good,humble and respectful.",5
Works quiet well for me here in Dubai. Plus i change address and order for family in India as well. Pretty cool.,5
Sublime.. They do have a great after sale service unlike some buggy portal I know...,5
Very great app.... Loved 😍 it Orders as directed 👌🏻,5
"Good seamless working easy to use app, with lots of restaurants options.",5
Take time in preparation of food too much. Not satisfied with time duration.,1
They don't send as same quality and quantity as they offer you at the restaurant.,1
The tracking section area in the application can be improved.,4
Very very good platform for food delivery I like it they give on time delivery and pomo codes,5
I have got a dead insect on my pizza when the box is opened.when I raised the issue with customer support and they are not taking any responsibility. I am really dissatisfied with Zomato for such careless and irresponsible customer support.,1
Experience was good but cost of food is High not affordable for students and not value for money 💰..... Hope Zomato take action on this matter....,2
Most of the time item delivered is wrong item n refund policy is zero n they are unwilling to support for returning the wrong delivered item.,1
very expensive... the orginal price of product in the shop and selling price in zomato is like earth and sky ...,1
"Delivery is getting poorer. Delivery executive is assigned more than one order, which sometimes takes the order 1 hour to reach after pickup. Food is not hot or fresh, cannot blame restaurants gor that.",1
"Love this app, easy to use with a lot of dining and delivery discounts",5
Amazing and all time favorite for food order and go out and search new restaurant and cafe .......,5
The customer support is very very poor. They just keep us waiting for hours and don't reply. I had really bad experience with Zomato agent (Kamran and Akshay). They just kept me on hold and didn't even replied to me. Please be aware that you may get theft.,1
"It is a very nice cake, I have the same taste and design as I said, I would like to give it 5 stars.",5
Delivery is satisfactory. Service is good. The cutlets were a bit more spicy.,5
"Very best app, fast delivery, good attitude of delivery partner, what else we want? Thanks Zomato.",5
It's very important to have timely hygienic food.zomoto is doing its best.The food is always good.,5
"Fast, good choice, good promotions, easy to order , highly recommended",5
The service and delivery boys of this app are very bad and the language is very bad and the food is not given properly.,1
Great app. There should be a facility to pay the driver tip after order is complete.,4
"Superfaaaaaaaaast delivery, aaaaaawesome food & all dishes....Thank you!!! Hope this review will help and motivate Zomato !!!",5
Doesn't mention if it is full portion or half portion .I just order tandoori not mentioned full or half assumed to be full. Delivered a half portion,1
"""Please introduce rating per menu item"" - thanks for taking this feedback and implementing it.",5
When I open my app it is showing something went wrong try again..can anyone please identify this issue,5
"Pathetic policies, I ordered food from a restaurant they accepted it after 20mins, then waited for 30min. When contacted delivery guy, he said restaurant is close and he can't cancel it. When I canceled it, you(zomato) imposed penalty on me instead of restaurant...Isn't it a good experience?",1
Worst service ever. Never expected zomoto to be such a irresponsible co .place order at murugan idly simultaniously they also gave another order to the same person who is collecting our order .I saw in app and the order which they received 1st is on the opp direction .when I chatted with them they r telling that they ran out of staff so they clubbed my order I asked to cancel the order for which they r asking to 329 rd as cancellation fee . Beware everyone,1
Not bad cash on delivery amount limit too low pls increase it,4
It's amazing experience as per me and the food also delivered on time and carefully,4
Excellent - user friendly app- amazing offers,5
"Bad bad experience no proper food delivery, items are missing, refund only the product price not taxes and delivery charges",1
This is the best online food delivery app Thanks Zomato....!,5
"Worst app , took my money and didnt deliverd the food,after talking to 3 hours they returned money and rider threatened over call Apology letter.from zomato:-- Hi Parminder, We would like to sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused here. We will surely speak to the delivery partner to understand what caused this inappropriate behaviour and promise you to take the necessary actions to ensure this doesn't happen again.",1
"Very fiew veg options,and they have some restaurants who's not delivering via zomato,but still registered on the list.so u make an order and get it checked and accepted but never arrive",3
"Worst app ever, it never takes my order properly and does not let me add cash on delivery. I am switching to swiggy or uber eats but never this app ever again",1
"I rate this app big zero, i ordered but not recived the order , they massage me that ordered delivered . Neither delevery boy nor local restaurant not received any call,i was totally hopeless. Guys don't believe this app becoz.very bad app and totally fraud app. Please stay away from this app.",1
its an worst experience with the chat desk so i dont think its good to order from the app,1
FOR THE FOOD WE PAY MORE AND FOOD QUANTITY IS LESS WHICH IS NOT ACCEPTABLE!! We pay the same thing at hotel or store or restaurant but why when it comes to delivery the food quantity is less..,2
Bit expensive. Some time it is like one meal at zomato =two meals from outside. Uber Eats was genuine and desent.,3
Cash on delivery is not there only that is main issue otherwise good,4
"Zomato is my all time favourite ...in lockdown, I have ordered so many varieties of food from it . Love the offers they used to give.",5
"Not consideration for delivery personnel, a delivery guy was given multiple orders and when I asked Zomato for my order, their staff asked the delivery guy for a rush delivery which resulted in him getting injured by an accident. So far the worst food experience. I never asked for the to deliver the food asap but asked why there's a multiple order to which there are not justifiable. So poor ZOMATO.",1
Zomato is very useful app. There services also to good am heartfully happy with this really so good nd faster delivery as well. Thank you,5
Service is very good but the taxes are sometimes so much increased.,4
Very nice and great app to have any kind of food at your door step,5
Has very bad customer service staff on chat. They don't understand or want to understand. Also they don't have updated details for vendors. They don't even know when a vendor has week off .,2
unable to fetch recent photos from gallery to complain or to give feedback..,1
Superb deals on Pro. With delivery and dining as well . Faster delivery as well.,5
Online rate are high compare to the hotels price list. All items are 50 + rupees extra charges.,1
Worst Worst Worst . Some times the food items are missing . Some times the order is not delivered . Sometimes the food packaging is not good . Worst,1
For the same hotel same product price difference is huge between swiggy and zomato🤣🤣 and so does in shop...and then give discounts 😂,1
"Amazing options at affordable cost. Highly recommended Tandoori Chicken, Butter Chicken biryani and Prawns Biryani.",5
"Zomato is a huge DISAPPOINTMENT. This is the worst service provider. I have ordered food from zomato today n mentioned in instructions that I'm allergic to coriander leaves so it must not be used. But my instructions were not followed and when i raised this issue to zomato customer service representative they told me that restaurant has followed your instructions, even after providing them proof they are not ready to help.",1
It's gives me very much excellent experience to get food before the time I m appreciate to this work,4
"My order is being prepared since last 2 hours and no body's receiving the call at the restaurant and Zomato is completely shaking it off their hands and not taking any responsibility.... I'm hoping atleast I'll get my full refund, now that they've kept me Hungry for almost 2 hours and now I can't even order anything cuz it's tooo late 😭😭",1
Awful experience 2 times in a row. Want your food to take forever and arrive late & cold; then order with Zomato!,1
"Unique signature dishes available, top quality food.. must try bhuna biryani, kabsa rice, alfaham, hot & crispy fried chicken bucket, zinger box... go for it",5
"Pathetic backend service.. they don't even keep an eye on orders punched... my order didn't came for an hour n when I started enquiry , it was then they woke up n discovered that valet is not in mood to do the delivery. And what is my compensation...a sorry voucher of 400 against my order of 650 and cold food at 11.15 pm in night... and then they say they are working 24x7... what a lie...",1
"I keep writing bad reviews(the truth) and they keep on taking down my reviews. If you don't have the guts to resolve the customer issue at least be honest and don't report and have the reviews removed. No hygiene, no customer satisfaction.. every now and then you'll hear their delivery guy getting into mischief. Swiggy is much better! 😡",1
Very very delayed for delivering the orders....... after 5-6 time call to deliver boy.......all ordering food is mash and colder.,1
Zomato chat is not at all supportive. Once i select the chat option i get automatically logged out of the same,1
Extrodinary delivery and very fast delivery,5
"Something that doesn't make sense to me is the no cash on delivery on orders above 350 rupees, don't know if it's related to Corona or anything. Otherwise a nice app",4
Very helpful to ordering foods but sometimes it doesn't shown restaurant near my location,4
Good service and good experience with Zomato and given so many time good offers thanks and it's real my personal experience if you not taken good food its given me refund my all amount Zomato I'm happy with you...I recommended to all and pls my request cover some more area in thane district site.....,5
Fantastic app. Good for online food orders. I really Liked this.,5
Customer care service is so horrible. I didn't get any solution to my issue of receiving wrong cake flavour from zomato. Hate this app and its customer care staff.🤬🤬,1
I like the app but if u search for particular dish can't find properly Its shows restaurant name but we search cuisine name,5
Zomato is not interacting properly with the restaurants. Restaurants are behave themselves they will not follow any food instructions and Zomato also not responsible for that. Zomato also leave them easily.,2
"Cool app,has great User Interface, complaints are solved instant.",5
"I always choose to order via Zomato .. service is better, app is better, riders are presentable .. pls ensure that you are always cheaper than Swiggy",5
They simply showing 10% off.. I ordered biriyani it's actual rate was 269 and it's 10% off then it may be get it on 242.10 but when I ordered it.. It deduct 269 rs it's new type to impress to people.. When paying money it will debit actual price money only not the discounted price,1
You have become very unprofessional and theoretical! Last few months the majority of the deliveries are wrong and we have collected your apologies too many times. There is no added value and for sure there is a lot of inefficiency from your side!,1
The took the amount and din't deliver the meal and there is no number to chat with zomato about this and they never chat.. Nor did they refund the amount.. They system sucks. Even the zomato delivery guy's number comes off while trying to contact him.,1
Its a excellent app but you should have kept cash on delivery for dishes above the rate of 200,4
Zomato is a very good app....After running it I felt no other app should be downloaded...And everyone can use it....,5
Worst customer experience..not even 1hour and 30mins delivery my order and not even shown delivery boy details.asked for customers service they can't even help me my order to delivery and iam full of hungry.this kind of problem are facing nowadays with Zomato..is it Zomato is trust worthy to usin all circumstances,1
Inconsistent with what's on display and what's delivered,1
Excellent app and very easy to use with lots of great features and offers,5
Zomato used to be the superior food delivery app. But now they don't have any good offers and have stopped alcohol and groceries which is a minus. So I'm forced to review my rating here.,2
I think they should also have cod (cash on delivery) for every time. It is just for 1 time 🙄,2
"Useful, hygiene staff and sometimes i feel happy to see the offers. Try to improve offers and serve the society by providing more promo codes..",5
They should remove the restaurants using their own valet. Dominos sec 56 had a really bad experience!! 👎,1
"terrible I need to add a new review but all I can do edit the old with the same old date :/, the item search, hotel search are all bad. Too many fake reviews zomato should try to regulate more",1
THIS IS AN AMAZING APP FOR ORDER FOOD AND DISCOUNT,4
"Worst customer service ever... delivered order late by 1 hour and of poor quality, when initiated a support chat, no one is responding to my messages.. really disappointed..i will now switch to swigy..",1
They have increased the prices and decreased the quantity to half of what it used to be. Even the size of pieces in mutton were small as peas.,1
"Sharp and simple accessibilitu,easy to use!Prompt service.",5
"Fast , saves a lot of money , but delivery charges are too high .",5
"Very bad experience with Zomato siwwgy is far better than Zomato I ordered many times but always got sm missing item nd no quick solution of prblm it take 3,4 days I never gonna buy anything from Zomato again",1
Delivery is getting delay most of the time,1
"Dear Zomato team, I loved this app, bcz of some offers , received coupon and good service always provide us. Application also working gud and fast.",5
"It's best if you you are in city, but if you ordering just 5-8km away from city that's time dangerous Bit in city no doubt 🙂🙂🙂",4
Excellent service and delivered delicious food with adequate safety and hygiene measure.,5
"Great. Better service than swiggy, does not limit restaurants by distance.",4
Automatically took the order and amount deducted from my credit card automatically.,1
This app is best but the only problem is delivery charges they r way tooooo high like 45 rupees seriously 😑😤 it's should be 20 rupees max to max ✌️,3
Running a fraud company i didn't receive my order and i complaint on chat they said we are not responsible for this after this answer i just cancel my pro membership they also said if you want to cancel your membership we didn't refund your money you have to use this membership but in application they write you can cancel membership whenever you want please refund my membership amount and cancel it,1
"I love to order whenever i dnt want to make food specially when I'm 🤢 sick so i ordered for my husband nd for me thanks Zomato , i just want to tell one thing that please give more offers and promo codes for your regular customer",4
No chat support will be possible after ordering food..very bad no solution for any issues,1
"Prompt,desirable and hassle free",5
Nice app. Even takes cooking instructions from the customer,5
"Promo codes not working,always shows invalid, used Mastercard debit card SBI, still says invalid.",1
they don't have a customer care number to call. only chat option which takes hours to respond. very bad customer support,1
nice one ..and easy to order as well !!! with quite attractive offers as well,5
Good experience but services are slow 🥺,4
Awesome user friendly app and lots of discounts are available here..I enjoyed a lot,5
I love ordering from zomato had a great experience only u should keep unlimited cod there should not be limit.exept that everything is great,5
It's nice to have Zomato.....as the people like us those who don't have family with us and no time for cooking in daily tight schedule......thanks,5
Superb quality...THANKS ZOMATO and Mr AJOY THAKUR (from Disha Bar and Restaurant) to solve my issue...,5
"Rates/charges are heavy in comparison with the stuff quality and quantity delivered, they executives seem do not take initiative on behalf of customers even when specific instructions were given",4
"Worst cutomer service experience, they support their vendor not customer. And customer will get the answers like ""this can not be undone"" . Looks like customer money dint have any worth to Zomato. How simply they said this can not be undone. Almost 90% their vendors are below average in food quality",1
It is very convinience and easy to order. And there are a lots of promotions.,5
No response from zomato help centre. I dont think call centre needs an hour to respond.. Still same after months.. cant increase the rating,1
"Customer service is very bad, it's no use of having issue with ordering smelly food or restaurant,, they cannot help with anything .",1
Zomato rider is always assigned at last minute. Many times food is cold due to prolong delivery time.,1
Quick delivery and best quality,5
Worst app I could have ever used firstly it said we can use cash on delivery but after I applied my order it said cash on delivery was not even a option,1
Worst app. They cancelled my order saying address mismatch even though correct address. Customer service is awful,1
The app first shows that the restaurant will open in 10 min. Then after 1 hour I can't even find the restaurant name Amazing glitch😤😤,5
"Overall, a good experience! Sometimes the app doesn't work well.",4
Really Great. Offers are not coming. Delivery charges to be reduced. Zomato is always best comparing to other online food app. Kindly try to reduce delivery charges.,5
Good service for customer and no online issues,5
"This the worst delivery app. All the times when i ordered, my order was delayed and Zomato also very poor to support the customer issues. I will say, do not install this app at all Ok",1
Prices of the menu's are always high than the original menu card of the restaurants..,2
The rate which you shows are higher than actual rate of dishes and still you take delivery charges.... please explain why?,3
One star also this doesn't deserve. This wrost app don't instal it all item price is double. And it promo code is not working and not showing also,1
Delivery boys are very professional. Good to see their dedication even in this pandemic situation.,5
Takes lot of lag between windows and gets stuck only when order is late. Unbelievable.,1
Excellent App for Food Delivery..,5
Thank you for such wonderful n fast 🚴三 delivery... It was my first time with Zomato and I love it... You guys are amazing bring food to someone's table is joy.. Thank you.🤘,5
Rates are dam costly they charge more than 30% on food they charge ₹60 extra for delivery and tax ₹20-50,1
This app is awesome love TO try New foods..,5
Its very disappointing ...that they do not deliver all around the area .....they should improve their area for delivery ...i think it was my last last from uh.,1
"As per my personal experience for the first time, it was good. Thank you for honest work, both restaurant and delivery man! Keep it up",5
Food delivery at anytime. What i feally like is the promt response from the customer care. Appreciate the customer service.,5
Awesome Good offers available Delivery time is good ☺️ Love to eat food in night times ..it's worth to order and get it soon,5
As long ad the order gets delivered ..its fine ..but the customer service is pathetic and dont expect a worthwhile response...so order at your own risk,1
Worst app I have ever seen. Display prices and final bills are totally diff. Unfair delivery charges and taxes. It's like a fraud. Also they will provide very less amount in online food delivery..China maal..😡 Better to go in hotel and eat. C,1
It too good and deliver food very fast and also give us more coupons 😊. But their delivery rate is higher. Overall good. 👍,5
Always change the mood by messaging 😃..... in some new and interesting style... Most favourable app for eating variety of dishes. 🤤🥳🥳🤩🤩🤩,5
Great application for ordering food.,5
For last 1 hour I'm waiting for an order. which was to be delivered in 35 minutes. And still it is on the way..,1
"Zomato is very good in handling customer service issues. They provide refund for any problem with orders, quality and food taste",5
I love this app for the value it provides. And the service it delivers. It's the best one so far I've seen.,5
It's easy to order and team is cooperative and understanding ... Good service,5
Overall the app is good..much improved UI from previous versions and is user friendly.,4
They didn't assign valet on time and food was late by more than 30 mins... I called up support guy and he told me that cancelation charge will be applied if I cancel the order. I had a bus to catch and i was too late... Pathetic Zomato Support... Her name is Divya.....,1
Very good and fast service.,5
"Worst app , always serves the food chill . But charging so high for delivery.",1
Awesome app. It prepare your order very carefully ☺️. Just loved it.,5
"The food from this Cafe is spectacular. Thier pizzas & pastas are mind blowing. A good value for money place, must try!",5
One of the worst service received ever. Their vendors don't even know how to read a order and send to there customers. Seriously pathetic service that you have and your vendors.,1
"Has improved, good offers .",4
Awesome app.. connects to every restaurant.. recommends accordingly delivery boys are punctual..,5
Customer support is average and cancellation policy is worse. Need to improve.,4
Offer it's ok but not expect then rate is very high some foods was very bad I give 4 star thanks for delivery boy very fast,5
"Great Format, Easy to understand and Order. Payment options are good",5
"Very useful, easy to understand, we can also have good savings 👍",5
"I have been given coupons which I am unable to use since the day I received them,I did chat also they changed the codes but still cannot use them",1
"sometime delivery charges are too much, even though restaurants are within 1 km radius",4
Best app for food delivery with safely deliver at your door. Zomato support is very positive to listen your complaints and do futher process accordingly.,5
"Train your delivery persons about what is the meaning of ""contactless delivery""!!!.. they ring the bell, put the parcel in ""hand"" takes a photo and says ""yaay contactless delivery""!!!",1
Why do you need to link account to Facebook or an email ID. It's so cumbersome. Isn't phone number good enough !!!!,1
Can't even take orders properly!!!!! Had to pay double just because of the application. 😤,1
Good service and quick delivery. But started to charge extra tax and stuff,4
Guys no need to take PRO service of Zomato as it is useless. I just ordered and forgot to apply coupon. Now they are charging 50 bucks for cancellation. Ridiculous Service. Don't waste money on PRO plz.,1
"Waste of money buying zomato pro , first of all it needs above 500 rs order to apply it. And most of the dishes shows not available on pro. Not good for a single person who orders food only for one.",1
"Cart not functioning, it says something went wrong. Unable to order.",1
Please be careful before ordering as no option to cancel order. Swiggy is better as one can cancel order within limited time period,2
There should be some more exciting offer to attract the customer.,3
IT was good at first but now they have stopped cash on delivery for me only.(edit) they fixed it now Thanks Zomato team,5
"After long years, installed Zomato, ordered food, with long talk with hotel guy and arguments, he gave an alternative food option, but then, guess what, Zomato says that they don't have a valet to deliver the food and they cancelled the order. Lovely",1
"Location service is not up to the mark, delivery guy always reach to some other location",2
Horrible service ever ordered on zomato almost 2 hours back neither they are available on chat nor they are refunding my money .... ..felt cheated nobody is available on the chat they even not mentioned there customer care number. Niryher they are reverting on my issue nor they are refunding my money.,1
Excellent app. Especially Zomato Pro which is very beneficial.,5
I love this app very much... it so easy to order dishes in this app.,5
Excellent taste & prompt service. Quick delivery. Safety measured followed.,5
Good options and reviews. Offers and discounts are reducing though.,4
Costumer support is never helpful to resolve the issue. Totally third class app.,1
Very Bad App There's No Hotels Which are Open In midnight and There's No Clear Options showing about the restaurants which are open Map Takes lots of time to zoom in Please Improve your app,1
The App gives me great dealings.. and hot fresh food with great quality.. so far I didn't meet any wrong queries.. keep going zomato..👍👍😍,5
Best application I've used ... customer service is quite good,5
It's an amazing app And the thing I'd like the most is the delivery Super fastest delivery,5
Very good Service & sharp timing,5
Life saver in these times if pandemic for all the foodies out their,5
Your restaurant order to food quality is very good & delicious. So thankful for your team and this app is very good quality food order all time.,5
They cheesy you change your food options according to availability and impose it on you just beard and check your order before taking the delivery cause after that they won't listen it's not there responsibility any more,5
So good... Unbelievable service... Very polite behaviour of the valets... Outstanding performances...,5
Very good and fast and secure service I like Zomato,5
"First order, thanks for discount, quick n smooth delivery. Food was reasonably hot.",5
"Very easy to order, and on time delivery and good food",5
It is very good app for deliver the food. the taste of food of zomatoa are wonder.i want to say that you can also try to order the food on Zomato,5
"Order was late, no executive was assigned to enquire about the same. Tried reaching valet but his number also not reachable,,,, frustrating experience",1
Worst service... Not delivering food on time. Cant trust this app when you are starving. Am gonna uninstall this app,1
Easy to order Service appreciated.,5
Very good service But could have been more better if the delivery would have come on time,3
"I orderd my food before an hour ,,what is shocking is that the delivery man picked up my order and going opposite direction from home just to deliver patched orders ,,if I have gone by myself I would eat there and comeback with plenty of time",1
Very very good. They returned my money after canceling the order. Plz add more vegan restaurants,5
Worst at initial order. Items get missing..... No proper after order support .,1
"I ordered from this app , my order got cancelled on its own and they took money as well not received refund and after contacting customer care they said they can't do anything . please don't install this app instead use some other apps for ordering",1
Not a nice first experience... delivery Man was very impatient... impolite and literally shouted at delivery spot...,2
Worst service from zomato support Noone responds when there is an issue with the delivery I have ordered from one restaurant and I have received other I will never order from this app norepinephrine to customers,1
"Pity service, usual delayed delivery, bad customer experience.",1
Quick delivery and awesome service,5
"It's an amazing restaurant for Chinese lovers. The best part about it is the rates are very much affordable with the type of quality they serve! Highly recommended. Do try triple schezwan fried rice, pot rice,veg crispy, manchow soup. Trust me it will not disappoint you. I visit this restaurant many times, it's my favourite when it comes to Chinese cuisine. Ambience is also good.But in busy hours you have to wait a little too much for your seat and service. Must try restaurant!",4
"its overpriced..there is no need to buy zomato gold as well unless you eat twice a week with zomato. there are hidden terms and conditions as well to use zomato gold. In short..zomato is useless and there are better options like swiggy out there. I still think the same for Zomato. A 150rs food item costs you 250-300 including delivery, taxes, surge charges etc.",1
"Inflated fake prices up by 30%. Actual Shop Price : 100 all inclusive, Zomato Price : 130 + Delivery Charges + Taxes",1
The app is great there's only one problem that the food always runs late,5
"They giving delivery to third party companies and they not performing good, they giving long distance orders to delivery agents, so they make delivery late always,. Tragedy",2
"Unprofessional app, Customer service is very bad, orders most of the time are late same company zoato and Talabat and the worst they don't have contact number to complain. Deleted both apps zoato and Talabat.",1
Very poor customer service by zomato ...like if a order is delayed they will penalise the restaurant but the customer who orders have nothing but to just wait,1
Nice and fast delivery but taste of food quality is not good in home delivery,2
I I have given Zomato only two stars because these Zomato delivery boy doesn't have exchange money and it's has not happen only one time it happens every time,3
Disgusting app. Very poor service. If you'll report any issue lile unwanted thing in food or raw uncooked meal tbey won't respond. Only the bot will kepp you revolving through the options. I'm going file a consumer case against this app.,1
A great place to have snacks just nearby to Thakur College... Melting sandwich is a must try.... Amazing experience,5
Fast and prompt deliveries with less call from valet.Fine place to order and dine at home with ease.,5
Pathetic time shows for delivery 30 minutes and it took 1 hour they should bound to policy. Cheating customers.,1
They are not giving good quality sevices of customer care.They charges more delivery fee.when food deliver with an issue they dont refund in full. They should fine such restaurants who are cheating their customer.and zomato also.,1
Very poor delivery timing even zero traffics in midnight. Its show 14min left to get order even crossing moreover than.,1
"This app make more charge than expectations I ordered 50rs icecream and i get 20rs icecream , it's bad for users and misguide peoples , bad quality of foods I'm complaint about this in consumer court",1
Pathetic .. How can u cancel after an hour and not give a reason for cancellation,1
Unsatisfactory delivery.. delivery delay.. every time I'll order door delivery but I'll go and picking up.. so bad service..,1
"Too good app for a foodie person like me , we get too many options at a single frame 😍",5
Horrible service.. Zomato have no quality control over the food we get.. and the hotel use this loophole and serve use all kind bad and stocked food.. since we can question them directly.. and Zomato customer care is absolutely horrible.. they won't do any thing saying we will take your complaint.. horrible experience.. better go to restaurants you know and get the food.. and there is also a huge price margin difference on the food when we get from hotel directly and food listed in Zomato..,1
Very flexible in delivering food to places at a longer distance from the restaurant.,5
"True app, if parcel is not came on time, they give back discounted amount.",5
"Extremely worst kind of experience always , the delivery takes around one hour and gets so dissapointing to wait that long. Going to switch to swiggy now",1
Poor....nowadays not accepting order below 150....ridiculous.....delivery charges hiked too. Also levying surge price always. whether some festive days or normal days.....moving to swiggy...,1
"Very useful for 24×7 busy people, cause Is they dont need to spend time for the food and transport etc ,",5
"Worst experience on the quantity issue I ordered couple of orders which were great but today when I ordered paneer butter masala 2 full from Balaji Santosh Dhabha Attapur Hyderabad, the restaurant has send 2 single paneer butter masala instead of 2 full, I paid for full 2 paneer masala but received the 2 single paneer butter masala, when I complained the same to Zomato help care the Representative keep on asking for pictures but not at all sounded interested in solving the quantity issue.",1
nice app you can order anything from your house by just tapping one button very very very nice app,5
Fantastic app to order food online..keep going,5
No customer support at all.money gets stuck most of the time. If anything is wrong then there is no one sought it out.,1
"Very poor experience , in menu they are showing 254 exclusive of taxes and on cart they are showing 302 without taxes.they are simply making fool.",1
"Despite purchasing Zomato gold (now Pro), You are taking average 30 ₹ delivery charge plus other taxes. This is the worst than any other things. You are taking around 70-80 ₹ extra. This is very much disgusting.",1
Not likely to use this app for minimal outside food takers. Zamoto Pro is just an eyewash. Nothing useful benefits. For an wrong order fighting for refund 3 days.,1
well uptil now have no issues except the additional charges of delivery is high.,5
Arey yaar! Amazing! I Love it! ❤❤❤❤ Pro offers are even better! Service is also amazing! Disadvantage is you tend to eat a lot of food... even late night 😜,5
I had just now ordered Lemon Chicken dry and Mixed Fri3d Rice from Golden Dragon . Instead of dry they sent gravy one. Moreover the lemon chicken was so bitter that u cant even put a single bite in your mouth. Horrible taste. Zomato people say that they can only inform the restaurant and asked me to write a review. An utmost displeasing experience after having spent more than 550 bucks.,1
"Other than the UI, everything is good. It's not very easy to make a choice in the app.",4
"Pathetic service... Package came 25 mins late, coke spilled all over the place. Two people delivered the parcel without zomato code dress while one was holding the coke in his hands! Yukk.. This is what you get for lunch?? Non-sanitised hands touching my coke which is spilled all over the place. One word : pathetic",1
Without delivering the order marked as delivered and no proper customer support... worst service,1
good food good timing aluminium foil good food was still were hard and crispy after 30 minutes from order.,5
It's upgrade then boom so good UI and simple and easy to order and great offers ....I am so happy,5
Very slow processing and very late opening of offers tab,1
Customer Support is very bad Zomato has not delivered on time and just waste my money n time n this app said if delivery is not on time food will be free but this not truth,1
"It's times to thanks all Online food delivery persons and hotels, who are servicing in this hard time.",3
The best 👍💯service and far better than Swiggy. Always happy 😊😁to get my food from here.,5
It's good but sometimes there is a cart glitch where the cart dosent open and I can't order pls fix this asap,4
Pathetic experience .... They given already eaten food ... food quantity is so less... Restaurant did not pick up the phone.. worst experience ever experienced from an app,1
"Very user friendly, Zomato service is very customer friendly",5
"Worst service, After the booking they cancelled the order without any reason. Worst service. Poor",1
Food Prices are too high than restaurent original prices. And delivery charge also very high.,2
The best!!! Zomato is a life saver in these trying times,5
i think zomato devloper doesn't knew how to see time it shows 15 min for delivery and order come more than 50 min. what an logic😏😏😏 btw app is good,3
This app is very amazing I think you should install this app fast delivery also is available here so what you are waiting for come and download this app thanks 👍,5
If you looking for some authentic Hummus then this is the place you should try ! The thick texture and the taste makes it delicious. A must try for Hummus Lovers in the city !,5
Always the best. Customer service and staff behaviour are really satisfactory.,5
Today was my first order in zomato.. The delivery boy kept the parcel and went away at doorstep.. The cover was torn and by this items were missing from total order.... The customer is at loss at last... When called the delivery boy.. His response was irresponsible.. Waste service,1
"The recent incident involving the delivery guy and and girl who wanted free food . Please do not dismiss the delivery guy too, before getting to the bottom of the issue . I would just like to say these days customer are not always right. Before trying to please the girl and firing anybody, try to come to an amiable outcome beneficial for all parties involved. I know social media is both intimidating and necessary. The app is by the way good.",4
App crashing during peak hours. Couldn't place order in the first go.,3
Better than any other food delivery or dining app anytime. Always a good experience 🤟🏻😊,5
It's making fool of customers the menu is much more expensive then in real and I have personally experienced it,1
Good service. But restaurant rate need to be more precise.,4
"The offers are good, Booking in the app is also very easy.",4
Enjoying the best from Zomato but expecting more to add on the list.,5
Very bad support from zomato...donot order...swiggy is much better than zomato....plase uninstall it,1
Most user friendly app interface with wide filter options for searching restaurants in your area.,5
Everytime there is no restaurant available for taking order than what is benefit of this app Previous it is good app but now it's nothing,1
Can add some more offers and make them easily understandable. Can also consider reducing delivery charges for pro members.,4
"Easy to use, fast delivery and having great options.",5
"Earlier I had rated 4 now Zomato has degraded hence 1 because if u compare the price at hotel directly the prices shown here are expensive and moreover delivery charges have increased , earlier u guys were customer centric now business centric with cheap tactics which won't take Zomato higher levels. it's been many times as well reported earlier of missing food and with fake reviews .won't recommend Zomato to anyone now, thanks for your services there are more better competitors in market.",1
"Log in problem, in this world most worst app. And also zamato has all scrap restaurants",1
"Great, always on time delivery and many discount offers 24/7.",5
Superbbbb very nice really very happy to delivering at any locations,5
Swiggy is better than Zomato. I got half/missed order in night 2 times from Zomato. Everytime i have to sleep hungry.,1
The best app with really easy interface. Many options available and great discounts.,5
It is much much better than swiggy. fast service. Good delivery. Payment secured.,5
"just because of the location problem,they have cancelled my order.. But the location was correct.. N they didn't even refund my money..",1
"always showing surcharge without any reason,if u want to beg then don't call it surcharge,swiggy is better",1
Zomato should have an eye on quality of food served.,3
"The delivery charges are too high... other than that, everything is really good",4
Good app and prompt service always,5
Very usefull and fastest delivery,5
Should allow option to cancel order for first 2 minutes,3
Awesome fast and smooth delivery without headech,5
This app not show delivery property and take more time....,1
Wrong item was sent to me and the customer service executive was so rude and wasn't even reading my msgs.. Pathetic experience with customer service. Uninstalling zomato,1
Very poor customer service no control over the delivery boys or the hotels there have been many instances where wrong food was supplied but still it goes on,1
Easy to order and very quick response to any queries related to order and refund,5
"Inflated prices, inflated delivery charges and overall a costly affair for the consumer. No use being a Pro member either. Biggest mistake buying a pro service. Beware before buying the Pro service, it is bad. Bye bye Zomato.",1
"Very bad experince ,ordered food and after 2 hours of waiting they cancelled the order,very pathetic service by Zomato.",1
worst online service. charged full price but didn't delivered the full order . recieved incomplete order . disgusting worst,1
Good delivery and really helpful,5
The staff tries to be extra sweet with automated responses but in actuality is not customer centric,1
Its drastically slow app .. took 30min to place an order,1
still got no news on my refund process. been waiting for 4 months and they always responded its initiated but never actually got accounted into my account,1
"Pathetic experience with zomato. I Order food from kfc at around 10:35 pm nd I already made a payment through layzy pay.i didn't received my food till 12 am. I have raise complain to zomato customer care but there is no response, zomato rider behaving very rude with us while checking about my order on phone call, he doesn't have any sense how to speak with customers. I cross check with kfc restaurant executive about my order food was ready but zomato rider didn't pick up from kfc.",1
The service is fast and accurate and timely and could make it better by adding 50% discount on all restaurants😋😋😋😋👍👍👍👌👌🖕🖕,5
Decent app. No complaints as such.,4
Easy to search and hassle free order process. Great discounts. Thanks,5
Zomato offers you a rice duo meal at 380/- without taxes from KFC. And if you add the nonsense taxes which are way too high then you'll see that the bill is going around 475/- but from the KFC app the base price of that same meal is 359/-. As a consumer I would prefer KFC app if you are a KFC fan and order a lot from KFC. In short what I've understood is that in zomato every dish is price hiked,1
Worst Service. After wasting my 2 hour neither the order delivered nor the amount refunded. Such a shameless people. Escalation desk stoped responding without resolving Issue,1
Stop promising free food on late deliveries. Think and care about your employees ....Do you have any idea about the traffic jams these days and also that the food is always not readily available for delivery executives to pick up the restaurant takes time in preparing it!!,2
"Good Service but, Adds on an extra charge, as compared to walk in, offline order velue",4
"The promoters are both,- greedy and miser!! Even after the food comes spilled or bad packaging where it is no longer eat able they will.refund 50 percent with a fake apology! We need more competitors apart from swiggy to set new benchmark on customer satisfaction",1
"This is a worst app and it has very bad experience with customers.if delivery is late, when we questioned delivery boy becomes frustrated and harm the customer.please remove this app from play store.",1
Going to uninstall apps - the reason is just simple. You need to hire Mr. Kamaraj (innocent guy) once again. He is facing a problem without do anything serious and she created unwanted problem to him.,1
App is not working fine on Oneplus 6T. Have to unistall and reinstall it all the time.,2
App is good but take high delivery charges,5
First of all delivery charges are high. And it does not have CASH option in payment section.,1
Very affordable prices also discount upto 50% on your first order deleivery on time also taste are really good👍,5
"I was unable to login with my mobile number, the customer support was not working on my issue",1
The food ordered was not properly cooked and raw. When I complained about the food they just said they would not let it happen next time I did even get refund for that food.,1
"Good experience , time to time delivery",5
I have ordered pizza in Domino's Today two hrs fineshed not yet delevered I have paid money and at last I have received that my problem will be solved with in 48 hs. But my money was not refudned yet now,1
A ok types app not more than good going.. Problems are there while searching or ordering..,3
I changed my review. Why? Zomato doesnt recognise Indian Institutes as places of potential delivery. For Years now we get on-off service in IISER Kolkata from restaurants in Kalyani. I am hoping that this changes soon and some exemptions can be made for the students who(alongside those in MAKAUT and AIIMS Kalyani) will certainly be a large market for Zomato,1
Very bad experience. No response and no refund back of money if we don't receive our order. Just grabbing hardearn money of ppl.,1
Better than other online food ordering apps and have great discounts and its worth taking the pro membership,5
I have received smelled item but chat support not help and they closed issue badly this is a customer harasment app swiggy is better then this third class app,1
Very worst response. Got missing food from order nor proper response from support. Support team kindly contact me for the chat script of the chat,1
There should an option in app to add feedback about restraunts and dishes and people can see it,4
Great UI and tons of eateries are tied up here..pro membership offers loads of discounts tooo,5
Offer are great as compared to swiggy..+long distance resturant coverage that Zomato swiggy never gives.. Zomato pro is +point again if you have good resturant at your place,4
Nice app. Delivery Staff should be good and try to improve the behavior.,4
all the hotels nearby are there in zomato. no need to go and wait for order. i liked the initiative and service,4
App is completely good but please add descriptions for the recipes,5
Its better to go to shop and purchase rather than paying delivery charges and taxes...,1
Excellent & good app orders and delivery 🤘🤘🤘🤘👍👍👍👍👍,5
Not good. Because instead of given instructions to the team they repeat same mistake and not refund the amount.,2
The price is little high but when you apply coupon generally price becomes reasonable,4
Delivery charges very high.. Swiggy is much more better,1
Rates are Frequently increasing. Huge Tax rate,1
Good service provider very fast delivery also,5
Service vise this is good but we can see dishes cast is very that why we can't frequently use zomato,4
"Pathetic service from Zomato. It is the worst food delivery app I've experienced. Honestly, please switch from this app to other food delivery apps and save your time and money.",1
Very poor services from zomato these days. Taking 1 hour 20 minutes to deliver my order. Cause multiple order system. Disgusting service.,1
The worst app ever. It took 1 hour 30 minutes to deliver my order because they clubbed two orders. Stupid service,1
It was my first experience with zomato today ....and I lt was excellent...proper & safer food delivery ...❤️...it delivers on time 🥰❤️...had a great experience,5
Overall good interface. Easy to use and user friendly.,5
"I ordered my meals and was waiting for the delivery boy (Alatab Udin) to deliver apparently the order which I never received shows in the app I have received and when asking from Venkatesh says he never picked my order and then he changes and says the delivery boy called me and I never received the call, it was me who was making calls to delivery boy and he never responded. Zomato services are gone pathetically to down. Once I get my refund I will uninstall thier so called pathetic service app.",1
"They promise something else and deliver something else, and for the customer service they've put just an irritating and smiling bot there which only works for sharing feedback and nothing else",1
"He brings food from very poor place. I ordered 2 different items, but both were exactly the same. The taste was absolutely sour, probably sent stale food.",1
One way communication facility which is not at all appreciable if your order is getting delayed unnecessarily,1
Excellent service round the clock. Love using Zomato and their offers are amazing.,5
"Excellent App with reasonable offers ,pocket friendly options are available.",5
"It is very good app for order food and very fast delivery , than I will also use this app",5
"Very satisfied, great service I always use the app to order food",4
App is very easy to use and find the choice .,5
A large no of restaurants option with good offers time to time,4
I ordered food with special instructions which where not followed by your delivery partner. Now I'm neither getting my refund nor a replacement of my order. What am I supposed to do now ? Worst service this is and wouldn't really recommend anybody. Highly unsatisfied.,1
Much improved. Remember keep good delivery professionals,5
"My kid was waiting for the food and shouting ""zomato arrived , zomato arrived. But she was supprised when he didn't get her food. As expected i was call the restaurent and he said "" yup i just see the packet left the zomato vallet.im sorry.but you can come here and get your order.after that i call the zomato vallet he said sorry i cant come. And you send (1)just know(2)refund(3)refund to zomato credit. But you can say dnt worry i will send the food give me some time. This is not first time,manny",1
Amazing application..life saving for foodies,5
Best food app since they fixed their UI in the latest update,5
It's just an amazing app we can't accept any thing more than this I am very much satisfied with the product,5
Worst experience dont order from this site ...Have ordered from a famous brand called behrouz kalyan(pathetic service) ......They have no cordination among their partner restaurants and delivery guys ....After waiting for 1.5 hour and calling twice they say we dont have any clue about your order... Seriously dont use their service,1
Worst chat support and response time is too long. Not worth ordering!!,1
Orders are now always late! Zomato is cutting costs by bundling 2 orders for a single valet at a time leading to delays for single or both customers.,1
"Horrible services if there's an issue nobody resolves it,my money is gone plus my order is wrong.rubbish services Third time I'm losing money, customer service is horrendous",1
"Zomato is the one of shittiest online food delivery apps, no it is the only. Open zomato search a nice restaurant go there and eat or order from swiggy or any other app, dont waste your time, energy, money and hunger on this atrocious app. They are charging almost 50 rupees as delivery charges. After paying this amount food comes after one and half hour. Taliyaaaaa Aur dher sali galiyaaan.",1
"The timer they use while delivering is improper, and food delivery time getting worse now a days",1
the app is good we can order food whenever we want its amazing and service is also goo,5
Delivery time is not accuracy . delaying too much,1
"Good user experience, excellent service, lots off options of good restaurants.",5
Love it. Anyone can't deliver here but zomato deliver in my location.superb app i found of food delivery on googe app.realy love it thanks zomato.,5
"The worst app, i ordered food and from last 1 and half hour there is no update and shows no help.",2
Delivery Charge is too high Refund policy is bad,2
Too much delivery charge..no use of applying coupon code ...price increases instead of decreasing,3
HORRIBLE delivery service PLZ DON'T DOWNLOAD.. I wish I could upload the picture of the food I got delivered.. First of all it was LATE and secondly the whole food was messed up.. Never gonna recommend zomato to anybody.,1
"Very bad customer support, not able to provide a copy of my bill since 3 weeks. Also food is very expensive in this app, try Swiggy",1
"Though the app is serving our purpose, giving this rating for the policies that organization is following on its employees. Zomato should always consider and review the delivery person's point of view. Customer is not always right. Hope Kamaraj gets justice!!",5
Lately it just takes forever for zomato to deliver... They are always low on staff and even restaurant don't cater zomato orders happily..... It's becoming sad n endless wait to order from zomato.,2
Really bad and it was a waste of money .. i order food regularly and this is how i get food after ordering so many times .. pls see into this matter seriouly because it has cost my money. And if anyone can take it return pls send them.. I am very disappointed and dissatisfied today.,1
Very fast and efficient service,5
"Hey Zomato, your service is great but at some time your delivery boys got late, but it can possible because they are human being not a superman who can fly and come to us very quickly. So I request you don't fire the delivery boys for this type of issue . they can late cause of traffic and transport issue etc. Please be liberal .",5
I ordered and they took 1 hour to just resolve a an issue to deliver item missing in my order.,1
Good app. Fast delivery. Wide range of choices.,5
"Off late Zomato has become a team of cheaters. Restaurants deliver pathetic food. After contacting zomato customer care, they tell you they have noted the complaint and take no action at all. While contacting again they tell you they'll refund for low quality items, but they do absolutely nothing until you remind them again. Upon contacting again, they tell you to wait for 48 hours. The circle goes on and on and everytime you're assured of better service next time. Awesome tactics.",1
Excellent service and discount.,5
Complaint handling process is very bad. No contact no given I ordered 16 Nos. pizza but they deliver 8 Nos. Neither pizza delivered nor amount refunded from last 3 days.,1
online support don't allow us to mention exact query. My order was cancelled after 30 minutes of acceptance.,3
Fake app...the app delivery duration and real time is different...the app adjusts the time according to the delay .,2
Such a pathetic experience with the app wherein it is asking you to add picture of the food and everytime the app crashes when tried.,1
good app ontime delivery I recommend to give details of the dishes if possible and main ingredients list,4
I can get faster resolution and very good UI compared to others food delivery app.Thanks for the service.,5
During the pandemic situation Zomato helped me a lot.. ate some mouth watering foods at the comfort of home,5
They do not have delivery people restaurants are using there own and canceling orders after an hour,1
The promos doesn't work no matter how many times you uninstall and install.,1
Very good delivery speed in this pandemic sichuation.,5
"Payment takes long. Need to wait for nearly 15 min after entering otp. Also, asks for otp twice.",1
Worst app ever seen Dosent support me with my issue I wasted my money and now I m hungry in this lockdown day.. because of them..swiggy is better atleast solve issue on their own don't wait for restaurants to do the same.. keep the change bro..,1
Good user experience and responsive customer care 👍👍,5
User friendly UI. Covers a lot of local restaurants.,5
Good . On-time delivery n all but sometimes food is not upto the mark,4
Worst App the customer service is very bad and don't care to call back are responed to customer They totally favour to the hotels and don't check what is our concern,1
"Excellent service, very good, keep going like that 👍🏻",5
They seriously don't pay attention to issues. They know just to initiate orders whether wrong or correct. Did not even replied to me in my complaint I raised through email to them.,1
always there will be some issue sometimes taste sometimes quantity sometimes packaging.,1
Worst app...too high delivery charges and taxes....as high as rs 100 at times,1
"Worst experience I have faced,I ordered food today but restaurant person told me that the order you placed is not available and still order neither canceled nor delivered ....",1
The cheapest service I have ever seen not following any cooking instructions a very use less app and customer support,1
"This app is good, but at first time order I got disappointed due to cancellation.",5
Good service and fast service,5
The worst customer support ever I tried ordering something and the agent that got connected has not even solved my problem and let me on seen for more than 2 hours and the restaurant got closed due to his late replies ... Would definitely encourage people not to use zomato.,1
The app works well however the cash on delivery should be applicable for all orders,2
Zomato is over charging Price at restaurants are lesser than what is offered by zomato by a good margin I found difference of Rs 50 on each dish,1
"The app is very bad,i ordered one item but every time i recieved wrong items every time and the app doesn't pays money back",1
I love the food from Twist the Taste and recommend to try Nasi Lamak combo from them unique and different experience all together do watch some video on how to eat this amazing dish all the way from Malaysia .,5
Awesome and tasty foods at a best price and will recommend to everyone.,5
Very delayed reverts on chat box for order related concerns! Delayed deliveries too at times!,1
"Chicken was not merinated and therefore,hard. There was no need to put such colour in the rice.",4
Zomato was good service but some hotels quality and quantity is very poor,1
best food at reasonable prices and service of the staff is very good with smiley on the face 🥰👌👌👌 keep it up guys,5
Great! Easy to navigate! Great offers too.,5
We ordered and we didn't recieved the order. Then the delivery boy said that they called and we didn't pick up the call. But we didn't even get the call and we didn't get the refund or the customer care. Highly irresponsible. We need refund.,1
The delivery man came drunk. Pathetic service. They force you to share GPS location over whatsapp with the delivery man. I felt highly unsafe using Zomato.,1
Zomato is looting people with their partner restaurants...actual menu is too expensive in zomato plus delivery charge plus they charge you surplus for busy days...wow if you are taking delivery charge plus your commission 20% from restaurant than why are your menu is too expensive than restaurants actual menu????......i really feel cheated from last 4yrs,1
Prices on Zomato are higher than the actual price in the restaurant.,1
This app is very good and excellent we can add very things in one order thanks Zomato and her team.,5
Best place to book variety of food and enjoy the same with family .,5
"Zomato is doing nothing. I ordered pizza and they cancelled my order since they can't deliver to my address I had paid them online But they haven't returned me yet . Very bad service Unexpected Will never ever order food from Zomato Worst ever !! I had even mailed Zomato , but no response . 0 OUT OF 10",1
This is best app for food. This give discount on swiggy I have check this 🍕 . The Zomato price is 85 rupees and swigg y price is 95 rupees and extra charges of delivery. So Zomato is so good 😍😍😍😍😍😍💯💯💯,5
Most of the time portion is missing but Zomato executive never assist event after sending the images.,1
Very Bad experience.. items r missing and payment was online so not got my money back or not my order..,1
"Fast delivery. , Delicious food . , I lv the app ... And easy coupon for discount",5
Good experience with zomato thanks for delivery and feeding many,5
Zomato delivery is on time and person is cooperative. Thank for wonderful experience,5
Very bad delivery service really not acceptable faced issue 2 times 1 I received wrong ordered 2 Most of the time I have received the delivery late,1
On time delivery on every order. I like it.,5
Excellent app with great delivery persons,5
The estimated time is worthless...it shows 30 minutes and I m waiting from past 47 minutes We can't able to contact our delivery boy...,2
Worst delivery ever!!!!our food is ready to deliver but they dont have available driver!!we wait for almost 2 hours and our food get cold!!!i will not use this online food delivery again!!!!,1
Worst service..every time they take more time then expected,1
Great but at times irritating when address is not followed properly.,5
on zomato you cannot cancel the order even if you ask them within a minute after ordering.....their chat executive are very very slow and are not helpfull....I DONT RECOMMEND THIS APP,1
I am really happy with this app honestly I have to go on a diet because I am ordering to much junk food and its delicious,5
Adding delivery address is cumbersome.option to add ph number to delivery address is needed.,4
This app is worst they doesn't give cash on delivery on orders. Really disappointed with the app and their services,1
Nice facilities of various functions..And also great discounts on regular basis,4
Very good service and polite attitude of delivery guys,5
Response is good .but. Shortage of material is to be taken care you have agreed to pay refund of rs 100 for shortage and I have spent 175 for the same for placing order again for the same matl,4
Complete hygienic Super Quality Excellent Service will make feel special.,5
"Good app, easy to communicate with your Zomato vallet, and fast delivery...",5
Im order nonveg pasta but giving mushrooms and hallopins in that why this kolaveri Don't do like this idont give any rate for this,1
"The delivery guys dose not speak english and no location awareness, in the other hand when u chatting with the support they find excuses for them and issue a refund which i will receive after 7days, what a service",1
Helpful and time saving.,5
"Lovely and no parallels for the discounts offered 👍 ., better experience can be felt with more better app",5
Good food and very good service....quick service as well.,5
The notifications that zomato sends is so interesting! Creative team is doing an amazing job!,5
I ordered food yesterday and I didn't get it. I had a very bad experience and my money was gone.,1
Very easy and convenient,5
My experience is very bad. I ordered for food from Haldiram at 3.16 pm but the food delivered me at 4.30 pm which was too late and the food was not hot.,1
"Worst Service. If they sent you burnt food and even if you do complain, they do nothing. They just tell you it will not happen again and the if the same thing happens again they repeat the same line. Never trust Zomato they are just liers earning profit.",1
Need to improve fast delivery there is some difference between the time showing in the app and delivering,5
Don't just take ratings on the basis of your delivery. Also support your delivery staff for all mis happening they are facing around the country. Some stupid people misbehave with them unnecessarily.,5
"May I know why the menu price more in zomato app, when I compare zomoto quoted price in app and price with restaurant menu. Almost 30% to 40% more in zomato app. Additionally we paying delivery charges. May I know who quoted the price in app. Is restaurant or Zomato. Could you please clarify.",1
A very good app to order food and many more other information!,5
It's one of the best app to order the food and it's pretty easy to use it.,4
Very good service but the address they get find it confusing 😕,4
The service has deteriorated day by day. They will promise to deliver within time but it will not happen.,1
"The app is very bad . The delivery people are really rude (mannerless, no politeness), they shouldn't serve people the way they did .",1
The customer care services are the best as I got refunded for a wrong order in like 2 mins so I rate it 5 stars.,5
I subscribed for Pro membership by paying Rs. 200/- but the benefits promised were not provided. Poor response on chat communication. Disappointed.☹️ Based on the communication I wrote an email to pro Zomato. Unfortunately the response was poor and my problem is not rectified. So do not trust Zomato and never loose your money on pro membership,1
"No proper hotel details and proper review, diffrence in price with actual food price is high",2
User experience is friendly and offers is good. That's it.,4
It is very worst then any other app...supporting team of Zomato is very worst...they even don't know whether ur order hotel is available or not...if u go for help then one person will come speak with us for some time and again another person will come and ask same question....This is early very delivery team app,1
All time show error in payment status...i cant ordering through this app..why all time i faced this problem,1
Delivery prices are very high compared to other apps.,1
Zomato today update new apps looks awesome. And service already Good 💯😍👌😇 New 2021 Update apps Nice.,5
Food delivery was very late by 20 min. more than described time of delivery. Very disappointed.,2
One of the Best apps for serving food. With following current covid restructions😍😍,5
It's nice and the best is the delivery time... Always received the order before time....,5
"Excellent ,good food good health add tests to your life to enjoy the feel of food, loving so much",5
Super app i like it i in palakkad in zomato is fast dalivary 👌👍,5
Worst customer support I placed an order as a gift and the greetings Card never got delivered The anniversary msg it was supposed to deliver was more important than the order itself I was expecting more from you Zomato Till the time you don't deliver that greetings Card.. I will not use Zomato service,1
Order price limit is not a good thing and sometimes it breaks my expectations.,3
Ok but please check food quality I experienced in Visakhapatnam some restaurants sending food thats taste less,4
"The app doesnt even work properly after i updated it, it takes forever to load.",1
"amazing experience! great staff,food nd ambience ❤️ just loved it! Do try the chembur vada pav & chilli chicken kabab!!",5
"Good , as from another State I'm, the service ,u r giving is good , but , sorry for saying, the service charge is high.. so more over , Zomato , All Is Well.. Great Job",4
Absolutely terrible customer service. They take such a long time to give incomplete responses,1
It's a realy nice and very useful app but sometimes a glitch happen not receiving orders,4
Very bad service and they may cancel aiu orders suddenly after 2 hours of placement,1
"A wonderful place my parents enjoyed the food especially when I ordered from BBQ mysore and we liked Zomato it brought us ,soo much happiness with its service and food",5
"App bugs, selected a pizza with 9 different toppings,got single topping and plus no responsibility regarding it,happy to uninstall,just to save 10 rs ordered on zomato,but got fooled",1
Before time delivery good and well behaved delivery boy,5
"Best service, polite delivery boys, low rates, good app , thank you very much",5
i observed that....zomato shows much amount than the actual price at outlet.....also charge too many taxes... basically we have to pay double money for food.,1
Food delivery always delay. Need to much more improvement max time delivery cold food .,1
"We are unable to chat with zomato app For Cancel the Order. When i tried to open chat box with zomato several times, Its not opened.",2
I'm experiencing this with zomato for the second time and.. I have ordered bdc an red velvet and it was a prepaid order .. the valet did not reach me .. now again with fasoos I ordered some food and it was a prepaid one valet did not reach me .. there is no response from the team at all I don't know how to get the refund for both,1
"Bad service, very bad, could not provide cutlery with the order, and there was no mention anywhere that Brunch N Munch dint provide cutlery, so whose fault is it..... Done writing, i was on chat eith zomato's executive for 2 hours, that's enough time i gave....",1
Poor chat support on issues with deliveries. its the same with my two consecutive orders.,4
Fast delivery. Will be better if more restaurants are added to it,5
Very poor and deceptive service . Full of lies and false update . Very first experience was very awful 😂😂,2
Not able to login post last update happened on the aap,1
Very Bad Food Delivery Service. Their delivery boys are beating customer such a rubbish service. Can't be tolerated. Thanda food entirely at the tiemllme of delivery. Yukkkk Service Zomato !!!!,1
Its pro membership is bad bcz they charge delivery fee as compare to other application they dont charge delvery fee in its and also your minimum order value for pro users is high so its a worst app,1
Really disappointed..Unprofessional behaviour..Charged money food not delivered and non supporting customer care center..if you guys cant handle rush hours ...simply dont take orders..Giving false promise making customer wait and not delivering food is very unethicle..will uninstall app and delete my account after my refund is processed...Add two more worst experience with Zomato.. extremely inconveniente and harrasment at all level without any solution,1
Application are good but sometimes the problems is tracking system.,5
Amazing . the service was also good enough,5
Best app for online food ordering:) keep up the great art of work in this development:),5
Great app 👌..Best than Swiggy and Improvement can be in terms of extra coupons.,5
Zomato has improved a lot! I see myself using zomato much more than swiggy these days.,5
"Plz make easy contactable services if food was not ok , restaurants using same food junction with different names and delivering poor quality to the customers",1
I have received a stale products from the shop and to get help with that I am trying to connect u guys but chat options are not available what the hell guys please connect us please even after writing lots of feedback to your mail and app u guys are not responding us very bad experienced,1
I love Zomato . Great job during lockdown .. service at its best,5
I would rather give a zero.I purchased food from this app and there was promo code for cashback I applied it and got the food when I did not received the cashback I contacted zomato but they denied to take responsibility of that.Really hate the app.,1
Very nice app.... Loved ordering here but a few restraunts are not available ...,4
Charges way too much for delivery and still delivery is always 20 to 30 minutes late,1
"It's was very bad experience.. Delivery boy doesn't contact with me.. No phone call, no massage, but he cancelled my order. And zomato doesn't back my payment.. It's my fast and last time order..",1
When I order my product delivery time was 20 minutes. When they accept my order the timing was showing 59 minutes. Why??????????,1
Excellent app good customer service..... Really helpful for me,5
App doesn't give proper transaction especially when you order combos it selects and send the wrong combination on its own,1
"I am having very bad experience with Zomato from last few orders, i would not like to give 1 star but minimum should be there thats y",1
Gives more offers than Swiggy... Need to maintain or giving more offers will help to continue in Zomato.,5
My order showing 3 minutes from past 30 minutes does Zomato wallet is not answering the phone. Confirmation code from the hotel that order 20 min back. Not writing this review because of this. Mujhe problem is I am unable to contact this Zomato support.,1
Amazing user friendly app with amazing varieties of cuisines with heavy discount. Love Zomato..!!,5
Good app & take care of customer.,5
With zomato order u can get pieces of paneer in veg bhoona and also quantity is also less of all items.,1
verry veer bad set up of restaurants and no help received.... i had good service for my last 3 orders but for the first 2 its like i still have that garlik bread and pizza in my dustbin because i am lazy.... rven if i were hungry i will never eat it,1
i lost money on this stupid app.... delivery guy has put delivered but i dint receive any food and customer support is like worst not responding at all.,1
Pathetic experience. Delivery boy left the parcel unattended at the gate. Even no help from the Zomato online complaint service. Indeed a poor state.,1
Value for money..hygiene and well maintained..on time delivery..contactless delivery,5
"Very late delivery, delivery person just roaming in area, the food was super cold.",1
Disabled coupon code section 30% extra prices than ofline (excluding packing and delivery charges) Worst app ....,1
Not able to find any support on the app neither the zomato is helping nor the restaurant person is helping with the order. It is exploitation of the consumer rights. Very bad experience.,1
Got reply from delivery boy that your order is ready - but I need to collect other orders also from nearby restaurants. My order is ready with him. Even if I get cold food it's not his problem & he cant do anything.,1
Just because I cancelled a COD order which was late ...Now they have removed that option for me.. pathetic..Vanessa was the executive I had a talk with and she said I won't be charged any cancellation charges but the removed COD option for me,1
Very costly and delivery time is very high,1
Very good appp Food quality is good But sometimes cash on delivery Restaurant location not available 😔😔😔,5
Not bother about customer complaint. Last time i ordered cake and it was delivered half broken. Hence requested for replacement none of them responded,1
One of the best app. Always reliable and awesome discounts.,5
Extreme fast service. Wid tasty food. Delivery person was very polite. Happy wid d approach.,5
Poor interface not asking for address at all.. accepted pin code as complete ridiculous,2
The best app !!! Food ordering is so simple Mega discounts%%%% 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 + Newly din inn🤩🤩 Really great!!,5
Very bad order experience twice. What is shown is not delivered. Next time they improve as per customer care executive,1
It is good app where we can get a lot of the variety of foods and good delivery,5
Really not expected that mostly the food is spoiled one's and not soo trustful,2
Always fast and prompt delivery. Delivery boys were very courteous.,5
Overall experience has been top notch and there could still could be a lot of scope for improvement.,4
Good app Delivery on time all the time 👍,5
"Worst customer service center,just placed my last Zomato order, no feedback option for customer service Delivery guy and customer service tell different stories, though they don't have item that I placed they deny to cancel, anyways I will uninstall after review submitting,bye Zomato, and wonder is from past 45 mins it's showing 10 mins wow super time management app",1
The customer service is pathetic. My order was delayed by 50 mins and I ended up getting the wrong order. When I contacted Zomato the staff refused to respond and I have screen shots to prove it....,1
"Very convenient , wherever we go ,we can order . Best app",5
I love Zomato! The delivery is good and I have had a good experience with it.,5
Nice UI and customer service has improved a lot after 2019 especially.,5
This things always happen. The delivery guys are incompetent of delivering and when help is seeked zomato keeps passing the ball from one rep to another with No help. The delivery guy spilled the cake and he blamed it on the restaurant... The restaurant ppl send the cake pic how they made and i also shared the one delivered. Zomata chat is so worse that from that since 59 mins m chatting wd them and 3 reps came and bypassed my case... Utter non sense and rubbishness from Zomato,1
"Worst app,will deliver expired food and no customer service response at all",1
Your clock system is worst your 12 minutes takes more than an hour and the funny things is they says its on time! Seriously,4
"Over all app infrastructure is good,but the chat support is not helpful,they are not helpful",1
Superb quick delivery even though the tracking was fake and especially a perfect quality,5
The delivery charges are too high,3
"The taste n quality of food are not good. I even got spoiled food. Even when u provide them proof there is no refund even if the customer care says that they have initiated the process, not to mention u go hungry becoz of it",1
"Best food app ever, i hope soon it'll be covering all the areas, coz totters are the worst, ps:haters back off :)",5
Worst experience with the food.over salty food received and on top Zomato delivery person was not even wearing mask .I doubt they even care to sanitize during such pandemic.entire food was wasted and no refund was also initiated.highly disappointed!!,1
Delivery personnel is very polite and having professional attitude.,5
"it keeps asking for location,after allowing for Location than also location pop keepet coming",1
tracking is poor.....zomato team not helpful....details of the stores are not upto date,1
Wow outstanding delivery and tasty food provide,5
Awesome services.. And no issues or any complaint... Exallant usage..✨✨,5
Excellent service and easy to find available resturants in any time,5
Nice and very helpful Fast service in midnight also,4
I really love that you guys have brought an option of priority for covid people. Its a great help to nation. Although my order was not one from that then too i got an delivery before time. LOVE FOR ZOMATO WILL NEVER END....😍😍😍😍😍,5
Restaurants are not getting organized by zomato as everytime chat guys saying restaurant are not picking up the call to inform cooking instructions because as i told you they don't follow cooking instruction shared by us and to raise the voice restaurants are not picking calls informed by chat guys😠😠,1
"I really like the atmosphere, good coffee, and nice interior. This place is amazing! Will go again.",5
"Terrible service by Zomato😡..I ordered 2 veg special thali which is including rice, dal, mix veg, bhaji, paneer masala, papad,chatney. but receive only rice, 2 packet Gobi curry which I didn't ordered and potato bhaji....@zomato please reply over this matter",1
"Very poor customer service, cannot cancel delayed orders and no support is provided by zomato in this regard.",1
"I hate that Zomato is charging delivery charges!! It's basically a delivery app, what is it's work anyway!!!!",1
Whenever I order anything it is either a completely different order or either some things are missing from the order.,2
"App is good but service is very bad.i ordered 190 rs food item but I received only item of 95rs ,one item was missing from raj&raj fast food centre ashiyana Lucknow.",2
Zamota uses customer queries as per their online set of options. They don't give customer a chance to elaborate their need or problem. One way communication. 👎🏻,1
"it is nice and easy to use, but cost and taxes levied are high",3
Awesome 👍 app...makes me feel hungry and order food ...keep serving and appetizing,5
It is good all about but the question arrive is about location pls solve this query as soon as possible and nothing 9s doubt about,3
Foods price on app is slightly bigger than the restaurant dine in price. Apart from that everything is ok,4
Its tracker is worst. Showing wrong map and vallet wad at my home but on map it is showing 10 min reach,1
Zomato is better than swiggy . You were order will be in time and their delivery partner are awesome like they do they care for everything,5
Good food delivery app with speed delivery of food,4
"Worst app for delivery foods.It,s too late of time to deliver foods 1 and half hour,s waiting",1
Everytime I order from Zomato It's value for money...None of Delivery guys has ever made any delay.....Love this app and food,5
"Amazing app, should offer more special and discounts on regular customers",5
"They don't come at all for support , they just waste time by doing show off that they are of very helping nature.",1
Terrible customer service and extremely bad live chat. They are not into real customer service.,1
Everytime I order something delivery boys doesn't have changes in their pocket.... I have to give that delivery boy 30 rs extra just because he does not have change.. its a good excuse to earn extra money as because we aren't going to check their pockets so we have no other options left instead of believing them.... so much disappointed as well as angry with your service,1
"This is literally the worst app every guys. The riders are so rude and harsh on the phone, they told me they will deliver the order only when they are free and made me wait for more than 2 hours. Also the customer care representatives are the most laziest, this guy name zafer idk if he was a new staff or what , I felt i would go to the hotel and collect my order instead of asking him for any help.",1
The discount code was not applied. I could not place the order in one go. Had to place two separate orders.,3
"Great to taste the food with that low cost, every one should visit, once, and eat with low cost",5
Superb but today my ordering bucket briyani combo set this listed item two missing cooldrings and chicken 65 I do know but menu is not two items but briyani taste superb I like this thanks zomato 👌👌👌👌✌✌,4
Pathetic service. Highly unprofessional people and app. They do not know what is the basic meaning of servicing.,1
When I see the cost of food is low but when I order it the rate increases and the riders don't wear mask properly and riders also asks for tip and irritates and suppose the time is given 33mins it takes atleast 1 hour to get the order,1
UPDATE THE RESTAURANT ADDRESSES ON THE APP! LEADS TO DELAYS IN ORDER EVERY FREAKING TIME.,1
Shiitiest platform as the senior managers are sitting on highrise and rubbing their belly while the valets/ delivery agents are doing whatever they want to . What a SCAMMING food delivery app .,1
"I ordered pizza from Zomato... And due to the mistake of delivery person I received totally spilled pizza ... Pizza was totally spilled in the box... I checked with Zomato customer care, they said you receive refund in 4-5 working days but it's been 7-8 days I haven't received any refund... Ridiculous services from Zomato",1
Don't trust their ratings of the restaurant. It could be false. Don't go by the name of the restaurant because not necessary it's an actual restaurant selling food.,1
I think its often waste cuz it doesnt take any locations quite easily cuz it tells no locations found i think it needz to be fixed soon,1
"Always shows fake time and they won't blame themselves means the back office they will always try to blame the riders, being a customer I have seen this alot of times . For the back office these riders get bad ratings. The boss of Zomato sucks , very disappointed with Zomato they will show 30min after confirming the order that will be 1hr , I know it takes time but guest and work won't wait for my delivery so Zomato back office totally sucks . Worst and cheap management by Zomato.",1
"Support is pathetic, To resolve one issue they are transferring the concern with 6 agents and even if I asked to call them 10-12 times they refused it. Recommend you guys not to order from Zomato. I have observed this with second consecutive order.",1
How long will the delivery surges be on.. literally there is delivery charges plus the delivery surge charges.. Let me take an example of a lunch meal veg it cost 105 Plus delivery charges 45 Taxes 5.45 Delivery surge 40 Total comes to 195 .. How pathetic way is this to loot ..,2
all item is over priced . Almost double price or more in every item.,1
Thank you so much Zomato for sending the food in time as always....,5
The decision to hide the number of reviews adjacent to the rating of a restaurant was an extremely dumb one!,1
Super fantastic best app with best offers better than swiggy and very fast,5
No Call Support nor chat support. Always says we are facing high support flow we will contact you shortly.....,1
Wrost experience no support for order. When I order my order got cancelled and I didn't get any refund.. I calling devliey person continusly but he didn't pick my call..,1
Average app campaired to others apps !! Sucking money in terms on Tax and delivery ! Should try reduce it !!,3
Pathetic service....talking to a robot feels much better than talking to a real life agent. You guys really need to step up your customer service.,1
It was a good experience with zomato app. fast delevry and user friendly. quality food.,5
Worst service if you ordered from wrong restaurant they won't allow you too change the restaurant and for cancellation they will charge high amount. Better go for swiggy. And there is no benefit of being pro member.,1
The Rates are different when items are added in the cart everytime.,1
"No service. No attention is paid to customer issues, since last many orders my order is served cold to me beacuse of late delivery. This is unbearable since you pay so much for the food.",1
"customer support was not good,not responding on time...they were giving offers for non quality restaurants..i have given 1 star because there is no -5 rating ,otherwise i will give -5 to zomato ..delivery boys are good ,please dont use zomato better to go for Ubereats ,swiggy ,or foodpanda...fake zomato",1
The UI compared to Swiggy is worse. Even your tax and delivery charges are triple than swiggy. Your app is hard to use,1
Love to order here... Food wise... Quality wise & coupons are awesome👏👍😊😊😊...,5
its very helpfull if you are alone and hungry they give the fastest delivery that they can Thanks Zomato,5
"Excellent App, earlier swiggy used to give it competition but Zomato defeated it by long shot. Keep rocking Zomato never change",5
Glad if order placed are packed & sealed by zomato tampered proof tape before delivery to customer @ hotel/ restaurant only. Ensure safety covid-19 measures.,4
Keeps on buffering...app says error and the order is placed.,1
"Strongly recomended, visit or order online , For any food lover best place.",5
More restaurants to choose from. Good service. Simple to use.,5
Nice work but need to some improvement like observ restaurants foods quality...delivery partners' responsibility,5
Food was delivered on time all the time with the proper precautions as per covid situations.,5
worst app ordered food last night and didnt got complete items items were missing reported issue and got respone after 2 hr😠😠😠,1
Worst food delivery service in india ...every time I placed order they will add my order in group orders (they charge for delivery ) and I will receive food after 1 hour ..even thogh the hotel is 15 or 20 near to my flat ..and the food will became cold and pathetic bez of they will keep my food more than 1 hour in Parsel and they will deliver to everyone at last them will come to me ..other food apps are 100% best on deliver time comapre to zomoto,1
Wonderful app for all of those who wants to make their lunch or dinner at home.,5
I don't know but there's no way to track dilivery taking so much time no food quality if we compare it to swiggy even though swiggy is also worst but 1 lakh time better then Zomato,1
It's not opening after I install.. tried to re-install and restarted my phone.. still same problem,1
Good for food delivery..and take asuch responsibility .so it's good,5
It's good app for service of supply food for residential enjoyment of children with good test,5

"Poor help center and service. The service guy has mishandled the order but no action against him, and the support staff says he didn't do it. Worst service will never return here.",1
"If enter wrong adress, after cancellation option is not thr, worst",1
"Let's not talk about food cuz it's the restaurant which makes them & not Zomato. Talk about their service level, they are doing Great! I mean what a service. Also it's better to become a PRO member & enjoy your food with best deals. I simply love them ❤️",5
"not good. order delayed It will always show same time arriving, even when time is ongoing",1
It's very quick delivery and make door step it's very good,5
"This aap was very bad , because I will order food from domino's their order option is not coustumize , I don't know but this aap is so poor then other aaps. 😬😬😬👎👎👎👎👎👎",1
Double charged for food and they won't refund. This app is corrupt. Beware!!,1
Extremely disappointing. Late delivery every time. Food gets cold and chewy. Wrong items delivered.,1
Nice app for food very cheap nd resible price,5
"Quick delivery, app layout is good and user friendly",5
Good overall but i dont know somehow it runs little bit slow..i dont know either server slow or something else,5
"Polite service and on time delivery, 👍",5
Good food and fast service.. so overall a nice experience 😊,5
It is very easy to use and the offers and discounts are a great deal,5
A great platform for online food order. I loved their offers and discounts... Just they need to improve that restaurant always remains online.. Too good 5out5,5
When order was confirm they didn't accept call directly accept or called just for only address details .. Before delivery..,1
"In real way this app and services not deserve 1 but i have no option to give ""-10"" star or ratings. it is such a stupid app.",4
Fantastic Service. Makes life much easier.,4
Pathetic customer support..cancels the orders quite frequently..refund situation is even worse.. customers need a new company,1
"Zomato is really worst , please do not order anything from Zomato I am rating this as 5 because if I rate it as 1 star they are not posting it they are hiding , first when we order they send according to restaurant and Zomato preplanned manner ,and what we usually eat at restaurant or hotel are completely different ,and they won't give any refund for false food or any kind of spillage or loosly packed food so friends don't ever encourage Zomato worst and don't order anything from Zomato",5
Doesn't accept orders for lower amount gives a message please add more order as we are facing High demand.,2
I really like your daily pops up for ordering food. They are too real 😊.,5
"The recommendation needs to improve, you cant show AB's when i am looking for manglorean food",1
The worst food app ever... The delivery guy takes more than estimated time and when he doesn't show up you cancel the order we don't even get our money back.. Never gonna use this wasteless app ever after.. So Dissappointing.,4
I am very disappointed with zomoto service always I am expecting good service with zomato but as usual zomato and restaurant service is poor or inse connected kisi v restaurant ka contact no. To kabhi ni lagta Taki koi v customer restaurant ko complain kar sake food ko lekar or zomato wale v customer ko jaldi response ni dete,2
Good delivery and order comes in time,5
All good but just feel that the delivery feedback should also be taken up more efficiently,4
"Bad, vallets are not in control of the company. They work on their own. They can delay the delivery upto 30-40 minutes as per their convenience. And can make a good food from a nice restaurant into something which is not eatable. 🤬",1
Very pathetic service Zomato....not friendly user..since 1 week we are following still problem not yet sort out,1
"Good class resto.in link,timely delivery,well mannered delivery boys.",5
Good food delivery app But delivery charges is thoo high,5
Really useful for enjoying food at home.,5
Service is getting pathetic. There is always an unreasonable delay.,1
"In most of my orders, it has taken over an hour to deliver the food. And in some the order had not been confirmed only.",3
"No words to describe your service. But what you guys did to the delivery guy without knowing the truth isn't right too, i loved your service and the delivery person were even friendly too. But, i guess you better support every gender instead of supporting one gender, won't order anything until the solution comes out.",1
"Worst service, I ordered 1 hour ago, and I was said to wait for 45 Min. I waited 1.5 hour Such a nonsense",1
It is very nice app I have ordered many types of food these all food are on time 🙂,5
"After waiting for 3 hours, order not yet delivered, app shows the order is delivered, too bad",1
The get the payment instant and at the time of refund 3 to 5 days and no costumer care,1
Late delivery and high delivery charges.,2
I love this App really amazing.. I use it every day and everything is really perfect,5
Less offer compair to other food delivery app. App using experience is great.,3
"Decreased my previous 5* rating to 1*.. Probably I won't order any food from Zomato further.. I had to wait for more than 1 hr for food delivery.. Upon enquiry delivery guy got 2 orders , so , he collected my order & waited to collect 2nd order at anothe restarurent.. Finally delivered my parcel after 1 hr.. In between i was waiting with hungry stomach.. What is the purpose of giving multiple orders to same person when he hasn't delivered the first one ??? 😒😒😤😤",1
Got fed up with Zomato because of late delivery so many times even after complaining. Very bad service,1
Anytime they can cancel the order while customer is waiting. After the complaint they have the readymade scripts for any issue. Pathetic service,1
3 stars because of delivery charges & 1 hour delivery time on weekends,3
"Zomato isn't only online food application, it's is also provide us good suggestion to choose food. Love it",5
"Customer friendly, resolves the issues of customer at the earliest possible..",4
thank you zomato for world class fantastic service but its a request please incl amazon pay as well as payment option,5
accepted all orders....at the time of payment order refused by restaurant.what nonsense.bogus app bogus restaurant.....want to delete this,1
Their feluvey boys are the rudest and can't quite deliver at the right location and then argue on the phone that they have reached the location and tell US that we don't know our own location. What kinda nonsense is that? And this comes from om the delivery guys above 4.5 rating. It's just a hoax. Zomato has lost it. Uninstalling... Swiggy is much better.,1
The service providers don't respond to pleas well and often they are rude. Sometimes they miss basic instructions and cutlery.,1
Perfect for foodies and sevice of food delivery is awesome,5
Such a nice app. Fast delivery safe delivery Very good.,4
"I received old and raw chicken(Roasted chickenwings Peri-peri) from Domino's for the order slip DPI66081 & Order: 217 however none (Dominions, vidyaranyapura) or Zomato took responsibility or provided me with a refund for the stale food or replacement of the ordered food!!! Worst part the Dominios outlet phone number is not valid. Zomato is like we need 2 days to resolve the issue. RIDICULOUS:(",1
I always order from this app only and it has the offer also to less the payment,5
they have simple idea....for any problem thay told we are unable to contact restaurant.. i was very frequent customer of zomato and provide at least business of 15-20k but now switched to swiggy. finally i would say....untill the problem arise they are good but when ever you will stuck they will not do anything.,1
Very good and fast service,5
"I changed my 5 Star to 1 Star till the time Zamato Delivery Boy issue not resolved and Zamato boy not join again in your Company. I hope you Understand, Thank you!",1
"Worest service app interface , ban ZOMATO, I was having very bad experience, I have ordered food it's been 3 hours, I am unable to cancel the order and no customer care responding.",1
Had ordered Dominos but did not receive the order..also the when I initiated the chat with zomato they give the number which was not working...pathetic service,1
An app who has made food ordering super convenient and easy for everyone.,4
"You people do not know address, no mask, no change.very bad experience with Zomato.taken so much time for delivery.very very very poor service.",1
"Very bad service, driver combine delivery and youbmay end up getting your food completely spoiled",1
It's easy to order but the order place is very very slow but it's nice 🙂,5
Good service bro .this app is awesome and ur delivery is also very good exact on time .,4
Overall a good food delivery app... Would love it more if it had info about halal meat in the restaurants,4
Wine delivery menu doesn't show up. It's more than 4 days. And hilariously Zomato Customer Support executives doesn't know too.,1
Worst exp.... delivery guy number was not reachable.....and on top of it delivery guy was blaming me that there was no response from me...even when i have made several attempts to contact aupport team and d guy......support executive on chat was pathetic as each amd every reply was delayed by 10 to 12 mins... I vl never use this app again.,1
Very nice app.. I can eat whatever I want... Whenever I want... Good service 👍☺️,5
Worst experience I ordered at 8.08 pm and till 10.35 pm not received the meal and no one from support team was interested to give me clarity for my booking. Pathetic,1
"I really had a great experience with ZOMATO.. I really love to order from ZOMATO.. Thank you ZOMATO for the great service. I really have no words to describe about ZOMATO, that much happy with ZOMATO. 100% happy with 0% regret.. Totally happy and satisfied with ZOMATO service.",5
Very bad service and urs zomato agent never resolution for public and I I'll never use urs service disappoint request to all public can't use this midetor Thanks,1
"This is very wrong I placed an order and was waiting for it and when I checked saw the order was cancelled by them due to some ""network issue"" Not even responding properly on chat issue We aren't fool here",1
"Donot take pro because after taking pro you will not be able to talk to customer support, you can only chat with them. I had disappointment for continuously three times after taking pro",1
Wonderful services to cover all types of cuisine and deliverd fast and fresh,5
Great Customer Service. Very Quick and apt. Amazing service recovery attitude.,5
"Food ordering is fun, not the over priced delivery charges for near restaurants.",5
This delivery app higher for extra charges and delivery charge you will bye any order 200 rs he will change 100 rs packing and delivery and other changes so.......I am really feeling bad......,1
Superb service.....I have ordered so late but that valet boy has delivered the order on time.,5
Prices are very high in zomato but actual price is 40 - 50rs less in restaurant ...other than delivery charges,1
Worst app with worst customer care services. Riders are good but the service of Zomato is horrible. I don't even want to give 1 star to this app.,1
Stupid app if they can't deliver food then why do they show the option of that particular restaurant this app don't deserve one star also don't download Swiggy is better than this app if u guys can't deliver the food within 4-8 Kms then this is the dumbest app plz don't download this app go for Swiggy they deliver the food within 12 Kms n this app not 4 kms also useless app.,1
Very slow delivery and time not update proper,1
"Not able to chat with the pro help section, they are just providing options to choose from and the customer cannot describe his/her concerns",2
"Anything about food, dining, lunching, breakfast or a night out; THIS is THE place!. An encyclopedia really, and a bloody good one! Haha!",5
Worst service ...i waited more than 1 hour my order was not delivered...and then was cancelled...and my money blocked for 5 - 7 days,1
I am very satisfied with a very good online food order app.,5
Very bad service. even swiggy is best with great offers and proper food service.i suggest every one to go ahead with swiggy app.,1
Facing issues on the orders daily should take care of the restaurant quality on combos,1
I had ordered many things from zomato ... Its really great loving app to order wat u like or wat u want .... Only please give some offers related to high prices dishes that will be easier for us to order,4
Nice food delivery app. Helpful and easy to use.,5
Bad customer service at late hours. They make you wait for hours before giving a reply from customer care agent.,1
Nice service. On time delivery. Very safe,5
Ordering food and selection of restaurants is very fast.,5
Amazing resto... excellent quality as lowest price.. really something for all,5
To much delivery charge compare to another food delivery companies. It is not good and work on it. It will lose your business.,1
Please don't use zomato The customer executive prasanth was worst ever. The time is now 12.30 I ordered pizza but I received biscuit topping with cheese and some veggies instead of pizza. I spoke to executive he said that I would request you to write review on restaurant page. This is only solution at midnight from zomato team. Worst ever second time same incident,1
Very stupid support service.. They penalize delivery people for no reason.,1
Superb maintenance in zomato all the best team congrats (swiggy is wrost payment frod and bad maintenance no response all personal cheating,5
Quick delivery and better service,5
"Awesome experience, professional representatives and on time performance.",5
The app is bettet now. The customer service still minimal,3
Theres no customer service no even. Cant even contact anyone in case of delay with the valet or from ZOMATO side regarding a wrong order. Worst service ever.,1
Poor service experience.... No check points ... Nobody take order seriously... Whenever they want they can change ETA. Bad experience... Poor zomato,1
The items delivered by Raghuveer were yummy and excellent. I have added them in favorite.,5
30 min delivery is a scam !!! beware.. all you will get is your money refund and some coupon from Zomato which is worthless. or just covers your tax and delivery fees.,1
Hi I see zomato boy video I have a suggestion for this problem wearing video cam cap for delivery food and upload data directly too the servers no one can access the without authentication Thank very good service,5
Verrry punctual service...it has always delivered my orders before time and shows me the best restraurants to choose my meal......Thank you ZOMATO😚😚,5
Nice food delivery app and we can enjoy our time when delivery can reach within home 🏡 😀,5
Its excellent App Very easy to use with superb service,5
Very Good application..timing of food delivery is very accurate..👍👍,5
Assigned orders from far way restaurant and food becomes delay for this mistake. Its a mistake of zomato not riders.,1
A good app for food order and good support team to solve issues.,5
"Wonderful, timely, cherrful delivery boy and good covid precautions",5
Superb food delivery app used...good job zomato,5
the Zomato support never works... it's better to order from swiggy,1
"They cancelled the order and not even informed and then asking us to cancel the order , now I cannot even reorder as well as lockdown is imposed very pathetic service.",1
My experience with zomato was good.The food provided by the hotel was delicious & the service was speedy...,4
"Support system is worst they don't value coustomers.Even when I got stale food,they did nothing. Highly dispointed.",1
Delivered within 10 minutes. Nice service. Very happy with zomato keep it up,5
Prices are too high compared to the original cost of the food..,1
"After 8:30pm no option to order food in all locations,,, service closed.we have no choice. It's not acceptable... just irritating....",2
Very nice application Fast delivery and delivery boys are talk respectfully.,5
Very slow service and always don't follow the special instructions mentioned,1
Whenever I'm hungry I will use everytime zomato not swiggy app I love zomato app and whenever there is a food maked in my home my mood goes off and at that time zomato is the one app which gives me happiness with their best quality and quantity food. So this the reason I love zomato app there is fast delivery with minimum charges of delivery. So that's why I say for zomato NYC service and fast service of zomato and keep updating new things and new offers in zomato app I will love use zomato App,5
I like this app....have every facility that you want on a online food order app...,5
It's nice app perfect work and find correct location on time delivery superb Tq😊,5
Every time with discounts is fine.,5
Good intuitive app to order food even in smaller cities.,5
Nice offers.. Dedicated to customer sides only provides genuine offers..5 start again.,5
"Bad experience. Since then been giving a chance but delivery took almost 2 hours, not just one order but thrice they did this. Such a disappontment 😡",1
only useful before you finished using all the coupon after thats its 3 times expensive der! and worst quality food,1
Superb app wow experice really impressed . It is really smothe detailes are well given wow,5
provide more features about rider improve map navigating,5
You are telling me to send my issue on Zomato support but I already did it several times and got very bad and one sided response I'm not going to trust this app ever even a local delivery app is better than this,1
Wrost service ever I am regularly order on zomato but today it's not accepted any online order of any restaurants in our area very ridiculous is this.....,1
amazing taste and choices provided by zomato. Doing good job,5
Very poor service.. disgusting response from delivery boy ...my order nt Completed not proper response .. dnt gv any order from this app..,1
Delivery charge is tooooo High and also taxes to high,1
Easy to use and operational is also good,5
Very Good specialy food delivery on time,5
Wasted time lots of time cancelling order Through valet. No call facility to support.,1
"Valets are not good. No proper service. Also there is no priority for PRO members. PRO membership is uselsss. Waste of money. Here onwards, I would never prefer zomato to order my food. Totally unsatisfactory service.",1
Zomato is not showing any near by hotels i don't know whether it is happening only in my phone or same to all...,1
It's really very good when we r tired we can order the food and audio will get the best offers,5
It's good for foodies nd hungers but zomato should give some extra coupens for there regular customers rather than pro membership.,3
"They have made me wait for 3hrs . To juy transfer chat agent , still not transferred .worst customer services",1
Item. Not delivered at my home.. Status shows it has been delivered.. Fake company fake staff... Have recording from restaurant and staff... Will complain for the same,1
Customer service is way too bad They do not make calls For food we have to chat for hours Delivery boy gets spilled order yet query resolution take more than hour Executive keeps chatting that's all No refund,1
There is no response or accountability with Zomato. There were missing items but Zomato support was irresponsible. Idiots and waste of money and time,1
Its very good for our and those who are handicaps.It also saves our time.It's very good.You are doing very well and in lockdown it's very helpful.,5
Nice food delivery app and very appreciable customer support services.,5
"Very good service, onetime delivery",5
Better discount and faster delivery,5
Very bad experience with customers care support executives they are not replying to my msg on chat i have an issue with my latest order they delivered old and bad quality smelling chaap so i raised a issue over chat but they are not replying to me frustrated with zomato now,1
Very bad. Plenty of fake hotels and fraudulent delivery guys. They don't check the authenticity. Order from a star hotel and you get a roadside food. Uninstalling. Swiggy is far better in authenticity.,1
"When you're about to pay for your meal in a restaurant using Zomato's app and expect to benefit from the discount, the restaurants frequently reject the payment method. Basically you pay for the gold membership and risk getting nothing in return",1
"So earlier there was a market option where we could order milk etc, why has it been removed?? Pls get it back",3
Its very easy to order food,5
Amazing a food delivery and Nice food and weary testi food,5
App doesn't work properly all the time and it's getting worse everyday..,1
Food quality of food is not good this 2 rating is because of the food they serve N for Zomato service I will give 5 points The food which hotel serve us was little smelly we did not eat and we paid for it hotel have to understand that if we r ordering from some special hotels they have to check the food quality first then serve. Once again for Zomato 5 star n for LA PINOZ 2 star for their bad quality of food,2
My daughter had ordered from macdonalds chicken burger etc on 28 march 2021 at11.50am and paid online rs.856. she is at hrishikesh and bordered for my birthday treat from there. But due to some network issues when zometo boy called her phone was not reachable. So the order was declined by him. Now this zometo app is declining refund of the same if zometo could not refund us then they should diliver the same order to me cause if phon was not reachable he could come to given adress directly.,1
"Good service - Best Food delivery app in Kota, Rajasthan",5
"Overall experience is good with zomato....but at times, mishaps do occur..",4
Good app for food orders for online👍 And fast delivery. In my opinion it is better than swiggy,5

Very bad service.zomato recieved the amount only if parcel is not ok and have many complaints zomato not refund amount they refound just 49 rs if you are pay 260 rs other 211 rs is totatly waste.zomato is so cheap.,1
Got a non veg order delivered with a veg sticker on it after patiently waiting for an hour for the order. All I got from Zomato as well as the restaurant was my refund and a sorry. Never going to order again from this platform.,1
Worst experience with zomato ... and mainly the chat with customer care is worst worst and worst ... its better to order in swiggy and foodpanda than zomato ... people make sure when you are ordering,1
"Pathetic service, Charging too much but services are worst",1
delicious! First order and now craving for it again...never had Kunafah like this before it was something new for me👌,5
Great first order. Let's hope the food arrives on time too.,5
It's a good idea but the delivery charges are very high as compared to before.,4
"Always some discounts will be there, vey useful and budget friendly",4
Some requests are not met as expected.,5
I came to Bangalore and at this destination first time alway looking for hotel for food first and then for stay because good food is first priority. Now I can stay any where at better location because it's assured that I can enjoy tasty food any where..,5
"Best app for ordering food online, gets me the best deals always and great food tracking...",5
I wish to give 10 star rating. Very happy to use zomato. You guys are incredible. Salute to all zomato team. Thanks alot to service in our location. 😁,5
"Received a spoiled food, no customer care number n support they said its non refundable alreayd mentioned in disclaimer. Completely day light scamming time to uninstall do not support these kind of scamming company. Customer care said only they can take feedback from customers they do anything from hotel commission , I dumped tht food into garbage bin... Pathetic n useless. Uninstalled finally.... I wish ths company should shut in india ...",1
"When contacted for an order which was delivered late, seems like the executive was helpless.",1
It's Very Good aap The easiest way to eradicate hunger is just and only zomato,5
Its a very good food delivery app. I am happy as they also give food coupons,5
The service is good and fast3 but the delivery charges are very high,4
Very good Service very quickly,5
HUNGRY THEN ZOMATO Lots of hotels and restaurants available to choose from. Loved zomatoing in these unfavorable situations. Keep going strong,5
Very poor service. Taking too long to reply for messages Customer service is hortible,1
Nice app and have a great UI/UX.,5
Like this app is the best order app and sorry to say but this love is better than swiggy.... It's way is here to order something on Zomato than any other app.... I appreciate this up a lot ❤️❤️,5
"Awesome, but sometimes retailers have the issue to diagnose the the bogo",5
Awesome food home delivery option.,5
"Everytime I order,there is a delay.Pathetic service.I am uninstalling this app.",1
"Everything is best except ,, local hotels and other shops availability is less",4
Great performance. Timely delivery and well behaved staff.,5
Very good... Covers maximum number and variety of restaurants...,5
Best food order app. Easy to get food at home.,5
"Worst app ever They take your order and then after 30-40 mins. They say that no one is available to pick ur order... And now? What am I supposed to do with my hunger? Only the reply I got is sorry for inconvenience. Now what to do with your sorry? Ohh yeah, maybe I should eat it right? Bastards!",1
I really ❤ the food and the way they are taking care of all the guest is really awesome.. Nothing to say😑 😋.. Diffinitely I will come back again... See you again team Asian Bistro Restaurant..,5
Order dispached but delivery person waiting for another order which not acceptable.. from. Hotel its despatched but due to delivery i have to wait,2
Its worst food deliveiring app as i ordered food from zomato and i also called delivery boy too many times but he didnt responded and after sometime my order was cancled and my money was deducted. And you all didnt have a customer support to listen to our grievances and solve it.. Zomato cant take my hardearned money without deliverying food. Worst app,1
Not helpful at all and do not issue refunds even if delivery is not made.,1
It's a wonderful app but! Please charge less delivery charges and taxes,5
"First thing no respect for women. Second zomato pro is useless because unless you order above 200rs, it is not applied.Delivery time is very high customer should die of starving. Delivery charges are high and all coupons are applied above 159rs. I strictly recommend to go with swiggy for small & huge quantity.",1
"The order delivery of Zomato is waste,when I ordered 16 Burgers of KFC,I was delivered only 2 Burgers,and the Zomato support team was not able to support me with this rather than asking me to cancel the order after waiting time of 3 hours",1
nice ambience..and the food was literally very nice,5
Delivery is very fast and delivery boys are also very good 🤗🤗 Thanku Zomato 😁🤗,5
"The food I ordered is very bad, and why I try to contact Zomato they didn't even care their customers. The food is very bad and the chicken is undercooked, so I contacted them they are not even caring about it , full waste of money. I'm having a feeling that I got cheated through this platform.",1
Worst service provider the customer support was worst had worst experience with the delivery no support in app we should send mail so what is the use of installing app provide orders in mail tooo,1
Every time i order i have to guide for home they fallow some other root and reach some where else.,3
"Totally useful,easy and very helpful app for foodies n everyone I really loved it😍😍😍😍😍",5
That's a neat application I like how easy it is to order food,5
"Previous was pathetic Wrong order was delivered Refund does not matter, expectations did not the presentation earlier.",1
Very fast and safe delivery...,5
"Very good n quick service by your executives, nice talking with the customers. They will deliver the food with wearing mask n maintaing social distance also.",5
In pizza or continental dishes some detailed description may be given if asked for by the customer so that he can make a informed choice,5
Very prompt and fast service.had a very good experience.would like to make my orders on this app.,4
Doesn't respond when restaurants don't provide service to your order. Doesn't treat consumers on priority.,1
Good ontime delivery...vera level..best when compared to swiggy...,5
Awesome food app. Fast delivery. Loved it 😍.,5
Worst... they take two three orders at a time and deliver each order so late that the meal becomes cold and no one can eat it.,1
Very Good and fast service. Love to get food again and again. Thanks Zomato,4
Awesome service and very helpful at the needy time( During hungry)🌷🌷,5
Kind of a ok app. Charges too much for delivery sometimes.,3
Worst delivery system. I order food through zomato they delivered all chutney and veg leaked out of pack. Ask the delivery boy they just reply they pick item as it is,1
Another incident where the app fails to deliver. The food is not delivered completely I have added comments but no response from zomato team or restaurant. What is the benefits of being pro membership. It's all scam,1
Good service by Zomato. Easy to order the food.,5
Worst customer service their customer service agent Kartik is was the worst and very abusive first i ordered the food it was not delivered and the status is showing delivered and on top of that their customer service is another torture better use swiggy,1
"The app is very user-friendly,full of handy discount codes!!Overall the best food delivery app in India.",5
no updates for the restaurants from years. should update reviews and pics atleast every 3 months,3
Excellent service from Zomato and timely & swift response to any issue has made me to trust them.,5
"Very useful interface , easy to operate",5
Charged me a hey hefty sum as cancelation fees when I canceled the order in under 2 mins time frame. Sadly I was a pro customer and you just lost one in me,1
Excellent app and delivery executives deliver the order always before time.,4
I ordered food online but my order was cancelled literally after 30 mins. Very disappointing.,1
You order for 200rs and their fees and taxes will add another 100rs.. better go and eat .. Too high charges. Most of time they so location is unserviceable,1
Super app and super customer support too,5
Good app for foods. Fast in delivery. Very happy with it,5
"easy to operate and handy features, with option of instant chat with them",5
App is good and food and service very fast and trusted app and covid freeless food,5
The customer care is very helpful and generous 😊,4
In our areas this is practice of Zomato to deliver food without any hotcase . delivery man hanged food item in a polythene and handed to me .food was not hot .all the craze of food has gone .if they can't restore quality of food during delivery period what's the difference of their brand.I have paid delivery amount for cold food. Even they can't provide any hotcase to their delivery partner.please focus on logistics more than technology of app. No solution given by customer care .useless,1
Very prompt delivery. Quality food,5
"Best,Found the tastiest food here.Yum! And its pocket friendly too",5
Very bad app. They collect only comission from outlet but will not take any responsibility.,1
Delivery is very fast and within the time with minimal calls.,5
"Easy to use, quick delivery.. nothing more to ask.. love it",5
"Worst app ever I ordered something It was supposed to be at my place in 30 mins It has been 2 hours And they kept saying ""10 mins"" And the money won't be refunded 🤣 cool Lmfao swiggy is way too better",1
Not able to select payment mode... Doesn't display online payment options from evening today... Plz rectify it,1
"Good experience with Zomato, best one among all other food delivery app.",5
Good with app and customer service addressing complaint about delayed delivery,4
Items duly paid for not received. Wrong items ( Non Veg ) on Tuesday sent by McDonald's. On repeat Veg order again one wrong item sent. More accountability required. Absurd app.,1
I love Zomato for its live tracking facilities and timely delivery,5
It is an amazing app for food! Youbcan trust them. It is always on time,5
"Pro offers are diluted. No value in pro anymore and multiple deliveries is not a great idea if food delivered late and cold, happened for the second time",2
"Have ordered food before 45 mins , still not deliver and showing more 45 mins , what time should a person have dinner .",1
all is welllllll... nice service n fast delivery with in given time . free delivery for first time go ahead,5
Out of last five orders four orders are taking more than one hours and food are chilled instead of hot Two orders are collected together and give delivery one by one . Such a horrible experience,1
Nice service ; speed delivery 😊Love the app,5
You don't provide proper care for customers in order... I was waiting for mine for more then one hour.. i already try to chat n call but still no answer... This is not first time .. so many times it happen.... U need to improve.....,1
"It is a superb app,one of the best to order food or book a table.But I miss zamoto gold and its offers",5
Very bad service. U will not get any help from zomato when crisis will take place. I've such bitter experience few times. Now i uninstall it forever.,1
Please update the map display of your app while the valet is on his way. I t does not show my location and valet's location properly,3
Good very nice with less delivery charge!! Better than swiggy Or any thing else,5
It is an amazing app and the main point is your delivery service is great,5
"Pathetic customer care. They don't even try to understand the issue but respond with cheap non sensible response possibly pre typed and pasted with no customer care. It is a pure waste of time chatting with customer care. So you are all ok if food was delivered, else don't waste time chatting with customer care chat.",1
Super and clean and neat delivery,5
My food was delayed by over 30 mins as there was No driver allocated to pick up the food and neither a response from Zomato. Poor service!!!,1
Best app those who want to order food for home delivery...⛪,5
Iam very happy and satisfied with the service.,5
Please try to add coupon offers on cod also else the overall app experience is very good!,5
Makes ordering food online easily and they deliver on time.... that's great..,5
"Very nice and useful app, offering great discounts and services",5
Great app. Great offers and discount coupons. Love it. 😁👍🏼,5
"Very bad experience, They said they can't refund me my money in case of quality issue. Writing this at 2.30 am as feeling frustrated and cheated. Doing frauds in the name of offers Poor service Zomato!. The customer service avoids you like you are nothing to them. Zomato! Do you guys even have values.",1
Delivery charge is very High & Quality of the Food is the normal.,3
Waste of money.... If I oreder some thing.. They deliver very poor quality of foods... If I went to same restaurant they provide quality foodss..... Then wats the difference of paying..... Waste waste waste,1
I'm unhappy with delivery time it's taking lot to time atleast give correct time of food delivery.,2
"I ordered n paid online, the amount was deducted n after 40 mins I get a cal frm delivery boy saying dat restaurant is closed, n they cancelled my ordered n didn't give me refund also. Dissatisfied",2
Third class is the word because i didnt find the word below' third class'. Just pethatic . Will never use zomato,1
I am very disappointed with the recent issue regarding the delivery man and the techie. It is clearly seen that the techie who accused the delivery man is lying about the incident.he was just defending himself for her violent action of hitting him with the slippers and he is not at fault. And the zomato team's action on him is totally unacceptable.he shouldn't have been fired until he had been proved guilty. We want the team to detain him and provide justice.,1
Unable to open for ordering . No response or help line available,1
The valet keeps transferring the order due to this the ordered food doesn't get delivered by time and the food doesn't stays hot and fresh .,2
Undoubtedly the worst customer service app. They have a bunch of executives who are not worthy of solving simple order issues,1
Unintuitive menu options and unprofessional and unapologetic service.,2
Very bad service..everytime some issue with delivery....becoming bad to worse..,1
"Excellent service, and solution to problems. Very prompt",5
Best app... App UI is awesome and Service is best,5
Superb customer support and on time delivery,5
App is good...only needs improvement in real time tracking of delivery person,4
Very bad delivery ...taking too much time ... always delay with there order..,1
If there is a food delivery problem usually we chat with ZOMATO executive but there is a problem that all time computer is taking to us so problem can't be solved all time so please change this system,1
After updated version install it show me only veg food if i selected my criteria for for non veg again shown me veg food.,1
-1 star for poor handling of food by delivery men. -1 star for not up-to-date contact details of the restaurants. Otherwise good.,3
"2 star becouse zomoto not give Discount at the time of festival but some discount give zomoto but it,s not benifit to me so i can give 2 stars and overall experince satisfation is very excilent",4
My order cancelled by delivery boy and I was charged cancellation why I am charged Very bad experience of Zomato this is a fraud I suggest to everyone not ordered by Zomato through online payment.,1
Zomato services are the best in current Covid-19 situation. Loved the food ordered through them. Keep up the good work. Thank you for your services.,5
They deliver the order late and moreover i received incorrect order repeatedly. Even after complaining so many times they did not take any action or refund the amount. They stop responding. This is ridiculous.,1
Fast and efficient delivery with kindness,5
very useful service. cost slightly high. should stop hotels which use plastic for over heat served foods,4
"All people are requested not to order food with Zomato. Both Zomato and restaurant cheat the customer. The restaurant confirms the order and calls to tell that the food is not available. The Zomato app looks like food is in the process. restaurant manager tells that if food is not available, If you don't want to, you can cancel the order. But canceling the order does not pay the online payment return.I have not received my money order cancel",1
Day by the service gets bad and the food quality as well.,2
And where is great offers section in app before it was there... But now i have to search one by one in thousands of restaurant's zomato going down by every day,1
Worst Food order app. You people are nothing but a scammer. You never accept your mistakes and try to fill out the gap. Keep it up and I am sure you will keep losing your valuable customers.,1
"Good app ,quick service , behaviour of all delivery boys are good",4
So many ads everywhere and so many notifications in a day..... Completely frustrating,1
This is a good dilvery good food and full compromize rate the full enjoy your time and party,5
Food was delayed by more than an hour. Valet was rude. No solution provided,1
Very nice food service but the charges are high i guess.,5
Customer support chat option invisible from 7 days why,1
Late delivery.food quantity not sufficient.waste of money.,1
Very good food delivery app. Highly recommended.,5
Great app everything is fine but they remove cash on delivery that's why not recommended,4
Very good app for food but Domino's Pizza does not accept promo on cash on delivery,5
Take feedback for yourself first. Rather supporting the sellers try deal with customers fairly who place the orders with you and generate your revenue. Without customers your sellers can't take any orders and you won't get any revenue at all. for more details check my last order comments and check my account delete Comments. pathetic services I ever received. not at all going to use Zomato ever and not at all going to recommend to anyone and try explain my experience with my near and dears,1
If the deliver man does not able to connect they take the order back and says they have delivered and didn't refund.. poor services,1
Very bad delivery experience with merging of multiple orders..,1
Menu rates are different from the actual rates. Late delivery,1
"Very nice... right time Al's delivery... thank u. Today date 07/01/2021 again very good experience very 1st delivery and follow all rules proper, Mark's & santite..😊😊😊",4
"Taking higher delivery charges, i make order domino pizza and not delivered pizza. I contact customer support but not getting response.",1
Received pins in my food and coustomer support was non-cooperating They charge more than the restaurant price and give discount and show that they are providing it for cheap price,1
foodie goodie ....changed the city from last order and still satisfied....best in the branding and offers and I want membership that I cam afford now hahah..lol..but soon will be.,5
Poor delivery service. Takes too long for nearby restaurants as well,2
Quality of food in zomate had been reduced and delivery after order is also very late,1
They try to introduce surge pricing at random time and steal more money,1
Pathetic Service. Had to wait for 2hrs for my order despite the restaurant was 10 mins away,1
Service good. And in time.,4
"Delivery charges are increasing day by day 50 rs is too much , even delivery from restaurants from 1-2 minutes walking distance are also being charge 50 rs seriously I don't think in future I will order from Zomato",1
I expeience fast delivery always of delivery is too late then zomato provide discount coupon but UI is sometime laggy,4
Not give the invoice of order even I contact with there executive but they also not give proper solution. This type of service not expected by zomato,1
"Worst service ever seen from any food delivery company, 40 min late still showing 19min more, how we can trust this app again.",1
"Always loved to order from momo cafe, loved the food of this restaurant..",5
Third class experiance everytime. When i have selected location near borivali. How can they send order to goregaon store. And for order they are taking almoat 2 hours. And not ready to cancel and refund. Worst service. I will chosse swiggy for delivery partners. Zomato sucks everytime,1
Such a horrible service and support team was disgusting no reply from last 1 hour neither delivering my order nor cancelled the order. Waist my money.,1
Delivery charges are too high.... Even for 1 km. Food place.,1
Love it. Try it. Chicken tikka wrap and chicken cheese melt wrap recommended.,5
Best coupons. Perfect price Wide range of restaurants are available,5
"Looks like map used by Zomato agent is pathatic, delivery boy always gets mislead by directions. Zomato must take this seriously.",1
experience sharing is awful. trust me you don't wanna order from restaurant they prefer. The client/Customer care services are awful.,1
That is good and very fast all delivery are give safely,5
Very nice app for ordering food online and delivers behavior are very nice,5
pathetic service and unprofessional customer service.. only answer u get for every concern is scripted apologies and nothing much.. was a mistake to go with the Gold services.. won't deserves even a single star.. Cancelling the order after 2 hours.. jerks running the company and customer care,1
Delivery 50 minutes from just 100 ft. Away fast food. Y do you charge for delivery when you can't deliver fast from 100 door food joint. Not worth ordering.,1
"Awesome app, nice food in affordable price. Cashback 👌😍",5
It was an awesome experience. staff welcomed us graciously and very polite. Food quality and service was also good. thank you for such a wonderful lunch.,5
"Tried to purchase pro, could not ... Have to order food without pro. The add was not working at all.",1
Very bad service.. taking too much time to be delivered.,1
"Hello, Why zomato app is not open in my phone? Whenever I try to enter it, it automatically exit. Thank you",2
Much late deliveries and also they have always the price higher than at the restaurant,1
One of the best food delivery app it is.....,5
Worst experience ever..these ppl are cheaters...just when two calls are not picked up they cancel your order and do not refund the money too.. atleast other apps refund the money...this kind of negligent haughty behavior I do not see with other apps...pathetic pathetic!!! disgusting customer care...u will soon be out one day cause better apps will be coming which are more customer friendly..get ready to be displaced!!@@@$&$#@,1
Very bad service and the system was not updated about the order.Please don't use Zomato,1
Overpriced food items and chat system is rediculous.,1
"Very poor delivery timing.2nd time in last 1 week,your expected delivery and actual delivery time is almost double..",2
Pathetic service received an incorrect item. I have raised complaint till now no Action taken from zomato. Wow. Such a grt customer service. Looting money in the name of food.,1
"Poor commitments. Poor service. And extremely POOR customer service. I wish, I could have given 0*. Free Delivery commitment option is a waste. They are just cheating. I wish I could have shared the screenshot here. I'm about Tweet with the screenshot",1
"First they double the rate from actual price and provide offer, and add charges taxes and delivery also, there is no benifit form Zomato, zomoto trying to make fooooolish to people. And also the delivery man not taking responsibility of broken items they broken his wrong ride...use less zomato swigy and all.",1
Pathetic experience ever my last order is total 30 min late and it's not delevery boy issue it's happened from Zomato side,1
"Delivery persons delivering wrong address and scolding us only. How to complaint against them, any number also not available to complaint",1
Until now the services are perfect...,5

Very happy with the service . Best app . Thank you zomato.,5

The hotel also didnt showed up any intrest on calling from which i usually order i'e masala darbar. It was a prepais order and there"" s not ant action taken against it.",1
"Don't leave your valet without change, sometimes customer stay without any change so your valet must have the responsibility to bring good amount of change not with the face that we submit our money to the collection and left with no change.",1
The food was good and delivery was very much earlier than expected and the delivery boy was very conscious and loyal to the job,5
The delivery time is very late and also the delivery charges are much more higher,1

"Worst app. Food prices are displayed more than that of the actual prices at restaurants. And I'm not going to order from Zomato again. Better at first, I'll unistall the app, and move to Swiggy.",1
Pathetic service waiting for a resolution since last 17 days. Pathetic service. Have to chasr for your own money . A bunch of theives,1
This happen with me today i have ordered from a nearby restaurant and got a tasteless food i have raised a complaint with Zomato but haven't gotten any solution yet really disappointed with the food and the Zomato service both bow will think twice before using Zomato,1

Very fast and safe delivery,5
Delivery price is too high ..even sometime it exceeds the order price .,2
"Nit able to apply ICICI card offer as the app didn't allow me to save ICICI card. This is simplest feature and even school going kid can enable button to save a credit card. How pathetic programming, testing and user experience",1

"A punch would have left her bleeding internally from nose more, than from outside. Also her nose would have swollen like a ball. No such thing happened 🤔. In her own words she ran after him to stop him after getting punched on the nose. A nose trauma would have left her lying on thr floor for several minutes..but she was running 🤔. Rehire the man and make a case against the girl. I had given 5 star review to zomato years ago and I am a regular customer still I am forced to unistall the app",1
Deliver time and food quality very good,5
Excellent experience. Keep it up Zomato. Do bring some changes in the future for user friendly atmosphere,5

Thanks for being efficient and available when needed,5

Very fast & accurate service,5
It's a nice app to used but sometimes a bit costlier than expected.,4
"They showed me 50% off for 3 times in a day, but after first order they doesn't show that offer.",1

"I have been using this last 2 years, always happy with the service.",5

It is very helpfull for all food is most essential,5

Nice indeed... I ordered from South to my place in North and dey efficiency understood and the delivery boy was so polite,5
"I have taken Zomato pro and waste of money , no proper offers and also while purchasing pro they said the coupon can be shared among 3 frds but now when I tried to share they are saying offer over even though it's still valid",1
Amazing app with loads of varities and good offer available and discounts,5
Good app and good discounts--- awsome,5
Food quality and quantity on this platform is very poor. There is no response from Zomato and restaurants.so don't install this App. Avoid bad App. I have very bad experience.,1
Always on time delivered with carefully packed food,5
"If order for an apple they will suppy you pineapple. Worst network and no proper customer support. please don't be pray to Zomato they never ever help, even customer care is very poorer, doesn't care for customer requirement you wanted to eat one food they will delivery other food.",1
"When items are missing from your order, they just wash their hands off it and leave you hungry until you order next time.",1
"Delivery boys are really irritating, charge extra for parking Also not ready to come at provided address",1
i ordered food and paid money by card the money was taken from card but but order not taken worrest app iam triying to chat with zomato but there is no option to replay contact num also wrong in Google worst i want my money back,1
"Well ,myexperience is horrible. I order the food and its not delivered. When l try to call the delivery boy he just block my number. Great.",1
Zomato does not do Full refund for missing items.,1
Was refunded only 45 rs for items missing which were worth 168rs although part of combo offer explanation from customer care executive was useless she told me it was complementary they lack basic understanding of difference between complementary and combo offer i think swiggy is better this is second or third time I have faced issue with zomato i am removing this app from my phone,1
"Never on time , and map not working at all .",1
I only give 3 stars becuse the service is not good sometimes it takes nearly one hour to a near by restaurant,3
Very nice and super app for any kind of home delivery food,5
Nice user interface and can order quickly Need to add some more coupons because Dil Toh greedy hai ji 😂😂❤️,4
Zomoto is the best place where we can order from home. There is lots of local or international apps also. But Zomato is the best.,5
Never got delivery on time. They always give lame excuses and try to compensate with 50rs coupon which i never used.,1
"Safe, prompt delivery, without any call,",5
"I had ordered they delivered wrong food , The don't provided refund they provided promo code of less then the order amount. In short they make fool you order anything it don't matter they give what they want .",1
Awesome app nd most important thing delivery item deliver very fast nd right time thank you zomato,5
Food is good but delivery service sucks..the delivery dont even the location where the place is,3
I don't hv any problem with the app or the service as such. BUT DONT FIX THE AMOUNT I WANT TO TIP THE VALATE. I TIP THEM 15/20 RUPEES AND NOT THE ONLY AMOUNT I CAN TIP THEM IS 30/50/100. MANY PPL WILL STOP TIPPING THEM LIKE ME. STOP THIS ABSURD TIPPING RULES. DISAPPOINTED.,2
Best food at nice price and awesome offers and discounts,5
Poor service. Deliveries take too much time. Test of food provided is also not as expected. Over all I have bad experience with zomato. Disappointed,1
Non veg dishes are not showing in online order menu in every hotel at pune. Why this so???,1
Very user friendly and pocket friendly as well :-),5
I always ordered food from purnabramha food hub nasik but when i ordered food today i can't received my order as delivery boy said i handed over to the other person i also filed an query ralted to same issue but from zomato customer care side they cant help me as give them proof about all this issue and also tell them about delivery boy rude and abusing behavior towards this issue as he says see my rating you cant gonna do amything juust do whatever you can,1
This is very amazing app and very convenient for home delivery,5
Pathetic experience for last two times. Same issue with delivery. Useless serviceability.,1
It's a perfect app for food delivary and one can enjoy food from their favourite restaurants,5
Can provide more offers for regular customers. Otherwise very good,4
"Its very good service,, than the other online food delivery",4
Excellent. Very good service and good selection and ratings,5
"I m not received Pulao in my order, Restaurant tell me pl come to restaurant and take the pulao. If I'm able to go restaurant than why I'm using zomato (worst service ever) for order. Further I m not able to describe my feelings about this.",1
Very nice... Very punctual.. ❤️ food was also tastyy.. awsome. Loved it... 3 cheers for... Zomato Hip hip... Hurray Hip hip... Hurray Hip... Hip... Hurray,5
Placing an order is seamless and efficient.,5
"Got wrong item and instead of telling bthe restaurant to fix it, they only refunded the money. I told them I am a diabetic and food is important. Yet they dint help me. All they had to do is call the restaurant.",1
provide unhygienic food and customer service executive was not responding properly and an end conservation.,1
"Rider giving wrong information, keeping the parcel at the gate, not delivering at the door step.",1
I give it only 3 star because food is delivered on time but there is no option of cash on delivery 😡😡,3
Promo codes given in Google Pay by zomato is scam.. Be aware... If u receive wrong item then they will say to mail the issue but the mail team and zomato are cheaters they only loot ur money and customer service sucks,1
Pathetic service. I was a very loyal customer but these people have no sense of how to value a customer. Swiggy is much better and more customer friendly. Swiggy also provide way better offers and deal than this useless Zomato,1
Worst customer service and food quality is also not good and also quantity.every time I give feedback.but they are repeatedly doing the same thing,1
Fast and Excellent service. Better than others.,5
Speed delivery and quality food with of best hotels and restaurants ☺️ I'm happy to use it..,5
So much cooperative online food app.customer support executives are so good with polite behavior,5
Very fast and Good service. Much better than so callee Swiggy,5
Bad. Delivery boys pick up food late so u get cold food. And their customer support says don't cancel order as food wastage and they need to pay hotel.,1
Awesome delivery timing and very professional people to deliver.,5
Map tracking is not at all showing the precise location of the delivery executive...,2
"Dark mode please. You also need to offer a delivery service. Otherwise, your app is irrelevant thanks to Grab food.",3
I love it most best delivery and wide range or ordering options.,5
Poor delivery experience. delivery boy did not find the address. Could not order pastry for my parents anniversary. poor customer support.,1
Excellent super app for food and super response from customer service,5
In the Zomato costumer service is very bad it is not reslove the issue of costumers. I have email on the costumer support but i not received any reaction from us,1
"Hey why zomato is not connecting with the agents i have not get my food till now, and they had charged me full amount but i haven't received my order and it is too late from the given time. Please help me to do the full refund",1
No customer support I'm facing problem for ordering food but it not take order but it shows me 30 min delivery time,1
"taking more time for delivery, predictable time delay by their own",1
It's a very good aap for ordering food coz it delivers the food exactly on time so food was also of good quality.,5
Sometimes coupon gets canceled and min COD delivery order is really low while Delivery charges sky high.,3
Customer service issue. despite of reporting an issue to the Zomato helpline they took the favour of restaurant that too without understanding the problem.,1
"Best app, just keep renovating the look of the app, so that we dont get bored!",5
I really appreciate how zomato delivers my all time favorites at my doorstep. The app is very reliable and I will definitely recommend this app to everyone. Thank you.,5
"Best food delivery app ever, simple but amazing app. Good job for the devs👏👏👏",5
Service are good but most of the times the orders are late,3
"They are cheating people, increasing price in their menu then hotel menu price. Each and every item have increased price of 15 to 50 rs. Then giving discounts, almost of no use.",2
Customer experience has gone from bad to worse. Better to call restaurants and order directly as they do absolutely nothing in between.,1
Wow it just amazing. A great needed app when you go out of your town especially,5
poor customer service. Too many issues in GPS map address,1
I always prefer Zomato for food ordering. ..Because I like this aap feature and functionality....thank's,5
"Food quantity is wow, test is awesome and fast delivery",5
"They are cheater, even if they deliver you stale food, they will not give your money back in full. You will get 40% of your money and no food. So you will end up having paid 60 % of your money gone and your empty stomach.",1
Price is too high than actual in the restaurant.,1
Bad service and late delivery and they don't accept to make refunds since they have problems with order more than two hours,1
good service compared to swiggy..specially delivery personnel are better than swiggy in terms of attitude and reliability.,5
Half of their restaurants are bogus and the restaurant never pickup calls from last two days I am facing this issue and have to ask for refund today also I will have to do that as the restaurant is not picking up the call,1
"Delay delivery, App showed, boys not allocated as busy. Took one hour instead of 30-45 mins shown.",4
Delivery charges are applicable even after becoming pro member.,1
Always on time satisfied with delivery.. quality of food is good but its restaurants thing,4
Great app. Always get my order on time.,5
"Value for money, good offers all time, good service",5
Everything is working good... Customer service must be upgrade like Swiggy.,3
This is very wonderful app for online food ordering,5
Great app with cool features. User experience is really good.,5
"Great service, Fast delivery and food was extremely fresh..Thank you",5
loving the experience and the discount coupons is a blessing eapecially for me as a student,5
Even order was bad... Customer support executive member has saying please leave this issue for this time and in future we will provide best quality What is it,1
Great App to gain weight during lockdown.,5
Very bad service.my pro membership balance is not refund I was cancelled my membership,1
Very easy to use and best for eat your favourite food in some minutes,4
You can't give OTP in some phones such as realme nazro 10 . Please fix this bug.,1
My go-to app to order food...great service...decent offers...i enjoy using zomato,4
"It is a very nice aap , fast delivery . But too much delivery charges",4
I oder food in zomato he will order faster but the food is not hot ple severe hot food,5
Shwoing some offers and increasing the price so it will be the orginal price after the discount . Better to order from the store directly .. i dont trust zomate anymore,1
currently very bad food supply as well as very poor handling,1
Zomato gives fake vouchers on apps like GPay. The actual discounts you get are far lesser than what is originally mentioned. Reaching out to Customer Care just results in ping pong between the apps,3
"Good App, If you are hungry This is best Application. Zomato provided 50% off on five delivery",5
Best app show live tracking and rider temp. Very good initiative.,5
When we apply promo code it's say not useable and they show that it already used even if the promo code is not used worst app 😔,1
Fraud.. Delevered horrible food.. Given me Rs 336 credit which I caunt even use... Just horrible. Will just uninstall and will inform my known people regarding the same..,1
"App crashes all the time, iam using note 10 lite and it crashes after reinstalling",1
No special coupons to gold/pro user. All coupons are same as normal user.,1
Awesome service on time and delicious food specially fast foods are very good,5
Worst app....customer sevvice also very worst...they just te to wait and they wont reply is back,1
Delivery experience is getting horrible and prices mentioned in zomato menu are more than actual menu card 😕,2
"Worst customer service representative. They don't give proper resolution neither they reply proper. Ordered food for special occasion and it was ruined with extreme spicy food and undercooked chicken. They don't even refund. And ask to pay upfront as COD is unavailable now. Will highly recommend my friends, family and all others who is reviewing. Kindly don't oder and use the app.",1
These are scammers they automatically add donations to the bill and dont provide any document for charity. They won't ask you and add the donation amount under tax and charges in the invoice.,1
Very much satisfied with the proper descriptions and prompt service,5
Excellent app! It has very good options. Very nice app! I really liked it!,5
Awesome. Great experience. Great discounts. Wonderful support.,5
Showing rate of food more than that it originally costs...then cuts Rs10-30 on the name of discount...even after that charge heavy delivery fee...f@ckk Zomato and thier business model,1
"I ordered my 1st dinner from Zomato for my family staying outstation . Amount deducted from my online bank account, got message for confirmation from Zomato. I couldn't contact my family for 2 hrs after that got message from family that dinner not delivered. This was really a very very bad service from Zomato.",1
"Zomato price list is more than restraunt price , it big difference",1
Sucks.. Not doesnot open at all. I am using in Note 20 ultra. Still not opening. Just useless for me.,1
Great app ! Awsome! This app always give me promo codes that made my order pocket friendly,5
Easy to use App and fast delivery great services by Zomato and also Zomato has good behaviour delevery boy.,5
"Horrendous, never using again, bad attitude, and unaccountable restaurants, cancellations without excuses.",1
Delivered by boy but some time late delivery. And costly purchase .,3
The payment method are too slow and don't accept cash on delivery above Rs 350 orders so bakwass,2
"No offers high tax and delivery charges Rates are hiked up on app ex if ₹ 60 in hotel, on app it became 80 on so many items also",1
Worst experience with customer service. I didn't receive my refund for late delivery. No one knows where is the desclaimer. Simply they will give reasons.,1
Exorbitant Delivery charges which almost doubles the cost of ordered items.,1
Quick and reliable service.,5
I ordered from burger King. Burger and fries but they only deliver burger. There were no signs of fries and if we try to contact there customer support they take a whole eternity to respond us back. Sometime it feels like indian trains are more spontaneous than ZOMATO customer support,1
"Cash on delivery is not available for payment exceeding ₹350, which sucks like hell. I'm really hungry. I don't want to wait for food like that.",1
Very good app. Delivering the food very fast.,5
Very useful app and quick delivery and good deliveries so good,5
The delivery charge is too much for a short distance.,1
Very poor customer service. You have to face mental pain and agony listening to their replies.,1
Worst service ever. Few items were missing from my order so I reported them on chat but no one was available to speak than I mailed them 3 times but no reply. I'm a plus member and they are doing this. I will never order agai,1
"I ordered a meal, meal was delivered soo late and the food was so unhygienic. Also the customer care representative named Fizza was not helpful in any way! She just blocked my conversation and never replied back on the chat!",1
Not to match as we expected in figures and quantities. Beware of figures.,1
Very high delivery charges and poor offers. Uber eats was best with its offers,1
1st experience was good But the next order of the same product got hiked up with no specific reason makes me upset and unsatisfied.,2
Amazing...fast delivery service I just love it...!!!,5
"Worst app, with no control on restaurants.... No solution or any problem Good delivery but Bad back end employees",1
Absolutely terrible. They might as well have a robot in customer service. Order for an ice-cream is over an hour now. Preparation time zero. Zomato valet delayed. And the lady on customer service says refund not possible. Can someone tell me if i can approach any authorities to get a refund? Update: LOL!!! 90mins after my card is debited the message is my ice-cream is being prepared. So now that the valet is arranged the dish is being prepared. LoL!!!,1
Very good service by Zomato in. Carona situation.. we can sit back at home enjoy food from any where.Thanks zomato,5
"I cant describe, I have no words, nice aap, nice filters, nice stories, nice vedioes, nice everything bro",4
"Why do I have to make a minimum of 250 due to high demand, i live in a small town where there is basically any traffic and there's certainly no reason for a minimum amount order. And the delivery surges are even worse.",1
"Payment was done but you people showing payment failed and I haven't received my refund yet, your app sucks.",1
Good app fast delivery. More they have proper gps navigation,5
The app is good but sometimes it doesn't accept cash on delivery,4
Amazing app Nd delivery partner are very good Nd food taste are always good,5
I'm giving 1 star bcz I had ordered food and wen I received it the food was spoiled and stinking and wen I raised a complaint the zomato people didn't refund or gave me another option they just said we can't do anything and I asked the restaurant person about the order they said refund is initiated to zomato but zomato is not ready to pay....These chat support people are so rude. Such a worst customer service by zomato.. My money is just looted by zomato.,1
This is the first time ordering with Zomato. Very good experience. Hope to continue in the coming orders also.,4
"No Ownership , very poor handling of customer issues. Better to approach restorent directly rather using this platform",1
They don't provide keypad always in help section. The bot replies in all queries. No human to help me in clearing the issue,1
Fabulous service. Satisfied with every delivery boy. Keep it up,5
Very good app. Gives discounts and lag free experience.,5
Not even working half of the time.... Restaurants are deemed unserviceable whenever I try to place an order.,1
Very user friendly app. More options with economically designed.,5
Though there was issue regarding delivery boy (zomato valet parmila) who was quite unprofessional😠 n didn't bother to deliver food. But later issue was resolved by zomato valet ritika. I called that valet and then he took the responsibility. 1 star should be given to mismanaged staff but giving 3star to another delivery boy to resolve this problem.,3
cant see all old restaurants in my online delivery catalogue at my home . theres just two restaurants showing right now . Whats happening???,1
Horrible customer service experience... Not staffed enough to even cater to complaints. Thumbs down on being invisible,1
lovely food in best price. taste was awesme,5
Pathetic food quality post corona and vast differences in take aways from restaurants and home delivery(very bad quality from zomato).,1
Food picked up and not delivered during lunch hour.. left hungry.. avoid paying online.. delivery boy endup eating your food.,1
"One of the worst app ever!!!! They just know how to charge their delivery fee etc. Serve worst quality of food, cheat their customers by charging too high for basic food that too in a city like Hyderabad as which is way cheaper! They don't care about customers satisfaction!!",1
Easy and Fast for delivery...The hotel also nice,4
If you are thinking to buy pro after you download the application then never do it. Coz it will be a total waste. There is no offer in pro zomato.,1
Zomato not supporting clients if clients receive food without any seal. Even I ordered different item and received different item. Reply received sorry for inconvenience. Hope their reply can't fulfill my issue.,1
Takes too much time to load.... Can order twice on SWIGGY by the time this opens,1
Delivery charge is very high and taxes also,1
Poor customer service. No quick response and service,1
Excellent app.In this situation this app is very useful to me. Thanks for zomato.,5
Order cancelled after 30 mins of placement. Instant refund not available.,4
Overall satisfactory but little bit time consuming. Orders take much time,5

All time bad service and very late delivery Very careless,1
Good offers..good service so far! No complaints!,5
"Zomato has enforced hygienic food packaging with the restraunts. And when it is not there, they have taken necessary action always.",5

Delivery is always late . Specially now,2
Interface is quite easy and simple.,5
Unable to convey delivery instruction to driver.,2
Missing order but was resolved within few minutes..well done,5
Many of my favorite restaurants are removed from Zomato gold partnership and all newly added or already gold partner restaurants are far from my locality....very upset about that....☹️ I am editing my review and ratings from 4 to 2 bcoz delivery services of Zomato have degraded since pandemic but it's already been a long time since lock down was lifted and still no signs of improvements.. it's like as if they have adapted to it by not improving.....😞,2
Delivery late. They don't credit the refunds that they are supposed to. Use only for SOS.,2
One of worst app for food attract people with offers and discount and providing bad quality and spoiled food and customer service not answering properly,1
You guys don't delivere all the things particularly. Today I ordered 2 things Donuts pack&potato wedges but I received only 1 item another 1 was missing. It's totally yours fault.yours delivery person was unable to told why another thing isn't including along with this pack. Totally irresponsible attitude.,2
"Pathetic,wait whole night for my order....but haven't received....after that there is only time pass chat executive chatting on....not a single zomato person helped...my worst experience...it's better, I should not use third party aap",1
Very very nice super and speed delivery,5
Best app.. lot of offer Easy to find the deal and they advertised as well kn Facebook,5
Location of delivery boy can be seen... And very helpful.. and fast in delivery ☺️☺️,5
They cancelled the order by themselves and blamed it on us that we cancelled the order neither refund nor the order we got they wasted 3 hours only in transferring the chat from one to another no help no solution worst service u can get never ever order from them they only hide there mistake by putting all the responsibility on you they don't know there valet they don't even reach the location and say ur location is wrong cancel without confirmation for confirmation they make a 0 sec miss call,1
Only one issue is delivery charges. Charges are too high,4
Prices shown in zomato app is way to high then normal restaurant,2
"Any option to selectlesser than 1 star rating? Very poor service, pathetic support group...food was not delivered...the delivery boy tells a lady at 11.30 PM to come and pick the food herself as he cannot burn his petorl to come to our house to deliver. Makes his phone unreachable and marks our order as delivered without even delivering the food. On contacting support chat group all they say is to send email and that they have given stern feedback to the delivery boy.worst experience ever.",1
"Doesnt maintain quality, most of time stale food is delivered",1
High discounting and very easy to use app.,5
App has experiencial issues when selecting customised orders. It does not provide choice options,1
"It's a best place to order healthy and PRESERVATIVE free cakes, muffins ,and Ice Cream ...It's Good that they don't use Margarine..Good Job .",5
Why did they removed my çash on delivery option 🥺🥺🥺 .. i didn't even cancelled my order . That's totally disappointing..,1
Many times happens food item is missing that's why I rarely use the aap,2
Zomato is really a god app for ordering your food..you all must go through it..its really safe ..and m happy of their services,5
Zomato's service is very bad and now its getting worst day by day. They never meet any cooking instructions.,1
worst experience from agent and restaurant food and Restaurant staff too the agent which you assist for us to talk wasnt able to solve our problem...! worst experience from both,1
Worst experience with the customer support team. None of the promo code work. They give you expired promo code.,1
"I have come here to say only one thing , That Plz Retain Kamaraj... As per my opinion he is innocent , Acc. to me , No delivery boy behaves like this , either he belongs to Food delivery app , or from any courier service. Hitesha is using a fake victim card , She is just exploiting the advantage of being a girl...... Kindly Retain Kamaraj.......",4
People are actually paying higher prices for food than it actually is. There is a 15-20% hike in the food prices shown in Zomato than it actually is in the restaurant.,1
"Great app, for everything except the reach in Smaller towns .",4
"Customer friendly, only drawback is delivery charges are high and some restraunt have worst food.",3
Very good service but not open delivery,5
"Worst service, they dont have contact number of registered restorants, simply for money purpose they are doing this, they dont even care for ur orders, kindly order the food from swiggy, they are better than zomato",1
The best place with multiple food options at great location.,5
Waste. Uninstalling now. No ontime delivery . Clock shows fake arrival time.,1
Bad experience.zomoto is showing very high price. otherwise shop price is genuine i am very disappointed of this.,1

Delivery is late and no offers and food price is too high comparing to hotels,1

Excellent service quality. Loved their fast delivery..,5
Nice all methods are there with cash also,3
"In the part of Food delivery no issues, but the way of handling Thier employees is very bad. For example recent Bangalore incident.",1
Offers are not really great.. I think you should work on this. I can be literally be a regular customer if you guys offer good discount. This is the least you could do for your customers.,3
Location feature needs to be more precise or accept address manually,4
I have paid my money double of times still my money not refunded. Waste this is not at fare.,1
It's a very good app for food I get every thing on time....great but app lags a bit pls fix it,5

"Very good app, but has some distance problems like other apps",4
"No option for wrong address change, or cancelation. Support executives are useless.",1
Worst application ever. Customer support system is so bad. I got worng oder and they just did nothing and asked me to order again.,1
"Best way to get food at your doorplace in this pandemic situation, every time I received hot food..",5
Always problem with location I give one location app takes one location,1
"Amezing app, easy to order",5
Zomato is such a bad food ordering app their customer care doesn't work well they don't look into matter seriously and they don't consider helping customers with issues i have faced this issues many times,1
"one of the worst customer service experience. ordered a cake for my dad's birthday stating please write happy birthday on the cake but when I received order and open it, there nothing written on the cake and I'm really upset with this kind of behaviour with Zomato and the restaurant, when I tried to connect through customer support I was receiving automated statements which is not acceptable.

"In Zomato food was really good and safe , and delivery is so fitst",5
Good user experience. Good customer service for transaction disputes.,5
Very nice fast delivery Nice service Good communication Delevery Boy and customer No confusion,5

It's a very nice app...better then swiggi...it's very easy to use...I love this app...good job Zomato....keep it up,5
"Not deliver complet item, and instead of contact still not solve my problem",1
It is the worst I got bad package issues and I have been trying to contact but they are not processing my request Worst experience I had with zomato!,1
"The most helpful app for discovering new restaurants, i love it.",5
Very poor services and the delivery boys are very bad don't trust on Zomato otherwise u wll have to be with empty stomach,1
Good app On time delivery Good staaf Understand the value of customer. Nothing Too S Say More Keep Good Working Always 👍 👌 . ..,5
I asked for promotional option for 15% but it got automatically cancelled while checking out,5
Terrible ordering experience guys. They don't have a call center. And the chat experience is terrible.,1
Very poor customer service. I received chicken khadai instead of panner khadai. I complaint about this order many time but Zomato just ignoring it. It's been one hour we are serving. I'm pure vageterian. Wrost customer service ever.,1

If you can't give us then why you tie up with this kind of company?.that's why I uninstalled your app. I was your regular customer, but from now I don't need to use your app or company. I'm going to use other app or direct purchase. Thank u",1
It's really amazing platform for online food delivery.,5
Waited for 2hrs...for food... Without any concern they cancelled it themselves ans saying app issue.. Please remove those kind of people if they are not having any respect towards job.. Very bad experience..,1
Zomato service is very prompt. It is a user friendly app.,5
Because of this app I am survive in Bangalore from last 3 years.. specially during the lockdown period this app was my savior..keep doing the good work.,5
"Fraud and cheating platform, just show the coupon but not give discount. Useless customer service.",1
I clearly mentioned not to add curry leafs but they added both the dishes which I ordered and i swear the taste of the fried rice was horrible their is no salt no spice nothing it was taste less and so much dried rice i keep on complaining about the taste of rice and instructions but you wher not responding properly this was ridiculous,1
New updates created junk support never opens up,1
I hate this app I had ordered mc Donald and the order guy declined my order because I was unresponsive as my no was registered and I didn't got any call from that guy don't download this app it is bad. And I didn't got refund,1
"Excellent app,very easy to order foods.",4
Very fast and well behaved delivery boy,5
M C driver delivery 3 minutes never get over in there app but in wall clock it's 15 minutes past,1
I love ordering on Zomato. I had installed this app in lockdown and since then I am zomato loyalist.,5
"Very bad experience, We place orders by placing trust on zomato but if zomato does bad things to the customer, wherever the customer goes, the guard becomes the eater. I would never order from Zomato.",1
"Pathetic service. If we complain about food quality delivered, they just say they deliver from restaurants so they can't do anything",1
The worst customer service I have experience with the app as the items were missing the customer care did not even reply to me and not picking any call the worst app ever,1
The address map lead your delivery team to next street which results unnecessarily waste of time and your team getting tired...,5
An always experience is that whenever I ordered I always gets the last delivery there would be more than 1 delivery before my order arrives why the hell?,1
Rates are high. While comparing to direct purchase from outlets,2
Great and quick service,5
Online Delivery timing showing wrong some time increasing and decreasing.,1
During multi order the item gets fully wasted,1
Fast delivery and nice food,5
Good application. Service is supperb. Satisfied.,5

"Very bad 👎service, they are deliver the without confirmation",1
Exceptional service by customer service whenever I have issues with my order.,5
Good app to have to order food to home,4
Zomato charges lot more and also adds tip to the driver on it's own. And also gives not much coupons. 2 is the max I could give.,2
Nice app I like this app but this app is very expensive (50 rupees delivery charges with all taxes 😤😤😤,3
Most of the times the deliveries are delayed but not bad overall.,3
"Nothing special on orders, charges too much as compared to swiggy and unable to use Zomato credits",1
I ordered 4 piece biryani worth Rs 300 and was delivered half portion. I raised my concern but was never contacted back to resolve the issue Zomato standards have gorn now slowly will lose all customer like me I rate this on line delivery platform in negative,1
Good food with good mood.,4
Sort out your valet situation. After 40mins i got to find out my valet never accepted my order and it took 1hr for my food to reach by another valet. This thing has happened to me twice in the same week.,1
Orders take too long to deliver. Delivery guys deliver multiple orders on the way. Food becomes cold. It's time to uninstall Zomato.,1
Really good to use this app and hungry free with low cost good quality.,5

I didn't get my money back. Customer care people responded very badly and joined with zomoto delivery boy. Very bad experience. I decided to delete this app,1
Easy to use and order the food,4
Charging extra for delivery.. Even though u charge 25% from the restaurant and ur charging extra frm the customers...,1
Extremely unprofessional customer service App started suddenly malfunctioning today and order got place when when I clicked view cart. Customer service started blaming me instead of doing nothing. Very unprofessional customer service.,1
Very worst ontime delivery.we wait for 2 hours for delivery. They prepare the food 1 and half hours,1
"Very bad experience, food not delivered and also they refund in zometo credit, and at the time of next order there are no option to use these amot of zometo credit, also they have no customer care number or any other help desk",1
super super best fast delivery good app,5

"Swiggy is far more better than this bogus application. They are more professional and punctual. Here, it is a bunch of unpolite, unprofessional, staffs who misbehaves with the customers. I would have rated it -10, if I had any options.",1
50% or upto 100 rs. I won't suggest this app as it's showing something but it is different in reality. Once it was showing offer an dinning but the outlet did not give ...this was in the Chocolate room. Think before you invest.,1
Zomato food ordering is becoming so expensive. We can buy product from the same shop with lower cost . Delivery charge is also very high. A product of 180 in the shop we have to pay extra 70 to 100 rs . So disappointed ☹️☹️☹️,1
VERY BAD. THIS APP FEATURES RESTAURANT THAT SERVES MADE UP DISH THAT IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE ACTUAL DISH!! SCAMMING RESTAURANTS THAT TAKES THE MONEY AND DELIVERS WHATEVER!!,1
App is frequently crashing during scroll of menu items.,1
Its great no delay in the delivery and everthing is right the food mainly👍,5
"Must provide less price option, prices are high for home delivery than original price",3
"I have already add a restaurant since February but until now, moderator don't process and crosscheck it... Its very2 slow respond... ☹️",1
App is outdated & status of delivery not showing proper. Also nobody receives phone in their outlet,1
Decor of restaurant is good and quite spacious and the food is awesome,5
little annoying and cluttered interface,4
Not customer centric approach. Needs more improvement and better customer support. Presently pathetic support to customers.,1
Pathetic service. Order contents missing and delivery boys talk total nonsense. Zero professionalism.,1
Worst app. The customer service is not replying us.. I have recived a different food and while refunding they are not replying pls don't install this app Many of my friends also uninstalled this app when I said them,1
Horrible.. Order has already taken more then q hr 30 minutes and still unable to track the delivery,1
Zomato Valet keeps running away with my food. Happened several times. All zomato does is return the money. Time to switch to swiggy.,1
Superfast delivery with excellent restaurants with more offers to have food middle class families like me in cheap price and best food.Thank you hunger saviour Zomato loved it performance,5
The app has come a long way with a great experience all around. Hoping for the same experience in the future.,5
taking longer time than usual for delivering food due which foods get cold.,1
This app is good but delivery time lately😅 and again & again notifications irritating me🙂✨,4
One star is also too much ordered food still not delivered..and on top the executive is ridiculously with high temper voice saying that he cannot deliver,1
excellent service with good staff and good food.,5
Was a regular there but now there services are degrading much. Pathetic customer support at times.,1
"Zomato service never help me with my order issues , they only waste a lot time by sharing chats to another exicutives",1
Delivery boys are taking multiple orders at a time. Its very delay. This is not right way. Swiggy is delivering very fast,2
Im enjoying the service and very reliable.. Keep it up,5
Service is good but application needs user friendliness,3
Superb but there was sometime issue of not showing delivery location,4
This app is really awesome and the offers given are good,5
"Fast delivery, Well Behaved Riders, Good Customer Care Service. Over all its Good. Satisfied.",5
Used Zomato after so long and immediately regretted using the same. No response on complaint on quality of the food.,1
Food items is very quickly and quality is best.,4
"Food is k... but not provide any coupon codes, no offers and applying so much home delivery charges.",2
Most pathetic service ever received. I waiting on chat from past 4 hrs for a supervisor. Hahahaha hahahaha what a joke,1
Always shown Location not found but swiggy have no problem with our location,1
It's far far far better than swiggy I Uninstalled swiggy after using zomato totally loved with your application and services hopefully it will be same ❤,5
"After being a pro members, I'm facing more problem than before. Extra taxes, more delivery charge n delayed delivery. Ridiculously",1
Very poor service . And low quality food .,1
"Earlier i have rated u guyz 5, but today i ordered the food , guess what the safety seal was broken and the food inside the container was also found that someone already eat it , radiculous experience i have...why is this",1
They are cheaters. Once you paid for the order and by change if the order get late then they request to cancel the order and after they don't even refund your money.... Fraud app.,1
"They just force to accept their coupons, while we are still complaining and have not yet decided. Poor customer service..Unprofessional jerks",1
Worst service ever this is the second time since yesterday. It is assigned to some person and if I call them they ate saying that it is not allocated to him. Worst service Ever*****,1
Good app and faster delivery,5
"Very good and very easily can understand,how to give order",5
The coupons we get from Phonepe and GPay can't be applied. Fix the problem or don't give coupons in the first place.,2
Last 2 order were horrfying. Ordered from mc donald and entire cold drink soiled over burger and fries. Previous order from keventers and rider forgot to pick my order. Had to follow with Zomato customer care for one and half hour then order was cancelled,1
I have been ordering since 2018 but It doesn't accept cash on delivery worst service ever,1
Delivery rates are killing the students. Please do take into account the fact that we are already paying so many taxes! On top of it your surge in price further leaves the customers helpless.,3
Excellent and fast service,5
Its good. Better offers than swiggy in kochi. But customer service is not up to mark.,4
Terrible app. Takes to much time to load even mobile web version is faster.,1
It is very good the food is very well packed and the food is very hot and I have very good experience with Zomato I suggest you to download this app and order food 👍👍👌👌,5
"i have order one cake and till now no information from Zomato, and INR498 deducted from my paytm. so refund either amount or deliver cake ASAP. ZOMATO service is very poor and no one available for resolve my query.",1
"Last few orders, delivery time is too much",3
service is good but most important your stand for the peace and harmony increased your star.. keep it up,5
Food delivery was not up to the mark. Food was cold by the time it got delivered.,1
The worst app. I have given location acess still then it is asking for location permission. Worst all 🤮🤮🤬👿👿😡😡👹👹,1
"Its good but still I fear about the online payments, I have face so many issues to my order. But it's good",4
It was very disappointed..i was ordered for 173rs and pay online before.. then order cancelled immediately due to Wong address. First Delivery boy Commet for refund.And do not know what you did with my order.. Till i don't receive my refund back.. i was chat on sem with support.. there is no one help us proply.. it's not expect from u Zomato .. a m very disappointed not happy,1
A very bad experience ...after getting the parcel that was all spilled ..I filled a complaint along with a picture of parcel that was sealed..I had the delivery boy too who saw this..but from Zomato they said sorry we wanted live pic...then Zomato should instruct their staff..it was not my duty ...why should I pay for something which I couldn't eat,1
It's very disappointing to see exorbitant delivery charges. I dropped out and did not order a cake that I planned,1
They select longer route and charge extra for delivery.,1
"its the most reasonable app i got... love zomato ,hope you give more mad more discount ....for me food is my life. thank you so much for working out during covid 19.",5
Pathetic Service Never Expected This. Now Degradation Gonna Start. I will be the First person to initiate.. U people are Faking People with No limit.. Neither Providing Proper Food Nor Service.. Afterall the Pathetic Service. Charging With A Sky limit.. this is Not the Same World Where u Used to live.. Nation has Changed.. Pathetic People Pathetic App,1
Very bad service.cash on delivery not available more than 350.i don't have credit card and debit card so how can I order from Zomato. Very bad service,1
"App efficient, delivery prompt. Better than Swiggy",5
good but location is problem because delivery address is not working,1
Don't order cake in this zomato app they give will some smashed cake or damaged cake and simply they will say give feedback in restaurant page that affect,1
"I asked zomato to provide bill details in pdf format, they are sending links and saying follow the path, these links are not working,simply wasting my time since 2 months, these people irritating me by providing useless links",1
Good service and restaurants with good offers,5
Your taking my order for my home location on selected days please do the needful on other days of the week too love the quick and hot delivery hope you gonna fix my issue soo,4
You have many charges for delivery packing surge etc etc.. we want food not charges.,1
"You guys are sending so cheezy lines notification thinking it would make a hype and it would be attracting audiences!! But would like to say that maintain a professional decorum. You are an enterprise, not a childhood buddy! Maintain a brand value",1
Easy to use great app to reach restaurant,5
One good point that you will get know the details of delivery person and his wishes. So we can help him as per our capabilities. Secondly Zomato should compete with others as there is less offers,4
Super very good app for delivery .And they are delivering intime,5
Very nice app But promo code are very less But all other things are excellent,4
excellent service its better to show pictures of food content.,3
A very good and simple app for ordering food,5
"Not trustworthy at all. 0% contact between customer and restaurants. Also, Zomato's chat bot is worthless. Swiggy is far better than Zomato.",1
The best appfor home delivery. Very clean and Safe.,5
"Hi team, Now my complaint is regarding the bad service from Empire restaurant, Mahadevapura Bangalore, I Have ordered Boneless chicken biriyani with kebab but i received only rice with out chiken piece's, i was complained in hotel call centre and received a call from hotel staff, but as per him item was finished no solution for my complaint.. I don't know how zomato is dealing with this kind of service..we have to rethink before using this kind of services..",1
Good taste pizza and delivery boy kedarnath is very good behave and fast deliver,5
"Third bad experience doesn't deserve any better ratings. Even after seven months ,service has not become any better.bad and late as ever.",1
Poor service ordered food does not fullfill and software does not show order status,1
The user friendly interface is absolutely wonderful,5
In new UI there is no Menu of restaurants.,1
Best food delivery aap... Its very helpful in lockdown ... Always have a safe food...,5
"Awesome services , great delivery varient food choices .",5

"Very bad experience , after I ordered from burger King they told there is minimum order 150 AED to deliver the food otherwise we will cancel the order Really very very bad experience with this zomato app. I will not use it again.",1
After making customer wait for 1.5hrs Zomato valet informs Zomato that the food is delivered . however it was never delivered.. hopeless app,1

"Not at all happy with the service, ordered for tandoori but got somthing which is not tandoori and not cooked properly and when I complain the person sitting is support says I eat tandoori and it is the same bad cust service going forward I will make sure that I or my friends will not order in Zomato..",1
Ordered food and it was supposed to deliver with in half an hour to 45 minutes but I got it after 1 hour. Horrible service and pathetic customer service. Mubarak he did not help me at all. He wasn't customer escentric. Zomato should stop food service.,1
excellent app! Delivery from Zomato is also great.,1
"Zomato is not responsible once the order is placed, they can just waste your time by chatting, don't even give call back to customer if they are asking.",1
"nice app ,if any issues they r responding soo quickly",5
"Zomato is doing great, just reduce the delivery charges a bit.",5
Gud but delivery charge is so high...even near place also same rate only,5
App must have option to cancel the order for at least 1 minutes after placed,5
Dont take any order on raju. Their delivery buys are Ford. They will exchange you orders with another local hotels. After that they will not pick your call. Be careful.,1
Timely delivery.. customers satisfaction.Zomato takes care of it's customers very well.,5
It's horrible. The delivery guy behaviour is very very bad. Doesn't know how to talk. Before delivering food marking as delivered and when we ask him he is telling I am having mercy and giving you food.,1
On September 2nd u guys told me that u ll add some credits due to delay of the order.....but this is 11th sep... Up to now I didn't receive any credits.... So only 3 star,4
"Customer service was not responding immediately.....When problem was rise they simply says ""we will give you coupon"".",1
"Useless app, takes hours to deliver food , poor customer care service....",1
Lovely app....but not for deliveries....swiggy is the best for deliveries....,4
Sometimes they take too much time but rather than that services are very good.,4
Pocket friendly.fast and best service 👌👍,5
"I really love this app, It's worthy or value to your money and you can trust Zomato blindly",5
Address issue all the time after live location active and propar address mention in app,1
Took more than an hour for the delivery.It took 40 minutes on empty roads for a 10 minutes distance.,1
"Worst customer service, took them 2 hours to reach the restaurant and even cancel the order without prior notice.",1
First order very bad experience.. Such online food purchase not good,1
even with clear instruction their 3rd order has been delivered with too much spicy masala. on complain they will give you 100 rs. refund after 7 days in account. Don't trust them for TASTE if you're not ordering from very popular restaurant.,1
"Order through Zomato, delivered 5 mins before the expected time nd it was hot nd fresh good experience 👏👍🏻.",5
Great variety of food items for people who can't cook food on their own.,4
I really liked Zomato until they gave me terrible service. Despite trying to get a solution they did not want to do the right thing.,1
quality of food not so good sometimes.and good should be packed in proper way.not in plastic bags.forced by company to buy more items.,1
It's a very cozy place with amazing ambience. perfect for family n couple dining.,5
Experience with Zomato was really best the service was really good and on time service they r providng6 which is really apriciable thank you so much 😘😘,5
"Zomato app is superb, but the delivery boys are very rude.. they behave like rowdies",1
Very nice app for quick and safe food,5
Very bad service it takes 40 min extra to deliverd the food,1
Arriving time is fake the app stops the timer when they are late to bring food,1
It's good and fast delivery with minimal calling good service i liked it better then swiggy,4
Too costly. all restaurants charge less if we dine direct . costlier than that plus delivery charges,3
Excellent place for good quality food with reasonable price.,5
"ZOMATO THINKS THAT CUSTOMERS MAKE FALSE ACQUISITIONS. Different agents give different information for the same claim. I have spent hours trying to explain that the delivery guy was not in the said radius and the chat agent had the audacity to tell that delivery guy always follows GPS n call me a liar. U better remove that useless promotion on 45 or free because after chatting with many agents and being passed on from one agent to another , your agents agreed that they are no fit for this job.",1
Very bad app Dont takes its customer complain seriously and maximum times ignores the complain of customers😠😠😠😠,1
Very nice service and sandwich is so yummy Thank you zomato,5
Multiorders is worst thing that you introduce it take lot of time get my order develer,1
It's best app that we have to order food in Bangalore when bored to cook 😂,5
"Worst ever, support is the worst ! Ordered food and then got spilled items and then a refund of 25% of my money! Losing ur goodwill !",1
"nonsense customer care persons not talking properly misbehaving ....if order cancelled within 2 minutes they force to to take it ..... Service not good I again tried after 2 years with zomato,got food so less in quantity",1
The food is good but ...the prices are very much high then it should be ... ......,1
Very good delivery partner...I am mostly used food more then home,4
I have ordered 9:30 pm and at the time of 10:45 pm I got information that your order can not fulfilled. Very shabby.😡,1
They are providing night delivery also it's super 👍 try this app and much more better than swiggi,5
Placing order is very easy. Customer friendly.🤗,5
"I love it this app, easily search and order the food",5
Great app. Just add some more offers to your old customers,5
Please check the items before collection from hotels/restaurants,1
I am a new account on Zomato and I am unable to apply any promo codes on ANY of my orders. The promo codes option is not getting selected only. I really wanted to order food for lunch but guess zomato doesn't want to cooperate.,1
Today I order two mutton egg roll from Arsalan and delivery person deliver the order after 2hr 30 minutes from the time of order receive.which is very much unexpected from Zomato.,1
First order and late delivery very poor service,1
"all restaurant number are switched off, delivery never on time, swiggy is better than Zomato",1
Very quick and safe delivery 👌,5
"Enjoying ordering food in zomato with low cost. zomato should look over surges,they should be reduced",5
keep hiding restaurents in the app and show them later when order from another restaurent.very good keep it up.,1
Why zomato rates and restaurants rates r different ...i have compared the prices of the same restaurants and the same dish ..in zomato rate is higher than the restaurant,1
Good emergency app but food rate is too high please reduce little bit for customers,4
Easy and convenient and faster delivery food thanks,5
Very good app.. but I can't order properly many times,5
Really pathetic. Payment has been made and order not delivered .,1
Best app to order food at any time🙆‍♀Will never think of using another ordering apps !!🎀,5
"its fine experience with Zomato service, good and fast delivery",5
You guys are making customer frustrated as why you guys always ask for add more item into your cart value ... as we are facing high demand for the restaurant. you should allow customers for only their desire food ordering.,3
A really good app with lots of useful promo codes. Love it 👍,5
I ordered today and it took more than 2 and half hr. Rider was not assigned. Seriously its a joke!!,1
Worst experience ....order not delivered till 1hour...still waiting... will not recommend to anyone,1
I had ordered food and wrong item was delivered. I tried contacting customer support but none responded even after sending mail.,1
Very costly food Zomato needs to give more offers and discounts,2
Easy to use .nice service,4
It offers warm food at dicscount and live tracking of delivery.,5
"One of the worst 😪 app ever seen. App has lots of features but 👎 pathetic, horrible 😑 tie up with hotel is full of foolish ness. Don't deliver what they say. Never upload this app.",1
After update meals for one option is not available.. kindly solve this,1
Always not accepting order Take too much time to deliver the food Make specific amount to pay Please solve these problem,3
Very bad experience with the team not at all helpful.,1
Life is more valuable than food.Never ask delivery boys for urgent delivery as rapid driving causes accidents & life loss.Stop the timely delivery or free campaign.,3
Poor delivery Waited for very long long long time Customer service department is not coordinating properly,1
"I have visit many places and tried wing chickens. today I have tasted the best chicken wings at barbeque nation. all the staff members are good, specailly deepak rawat. thanks for the services.",5
Very poor service i have been trying from days to connect with customer care but as i have not recieved my order but no response,1
Very nice...who would have thought we'd see progress in Kanpur.,5
This was my first order and it was super fast .. and delicious too .. however it was enough to kill my hunger that too without cooking anything at 4am 😁.. Alhamdulillah ..,5
Swiggy is better than Zomato...even they are providing more discount after purchasing pro member on Zomato.,1
Improper service Food I ordered was cash on delivery and food was partly delivered when I complained about it on the app all they had to offer was appology and a coupon code which I can claim in 30 days I doubt if this is my first time experience then what should I expect here after . Sorry but I'm not willing to use this app again there are better competitors in market so please provide a better resolution and keep your coupon code with you. Thank you,1
Really happy you have started delivery food in my local area just giving 5 star for this,5
An easy and contactless way to order food...,5
forcing to purchase additional 100-200 or minimum order of400-500 saying surge in demand etc .if you can't provide service say no deliverry available.why should I buy for more if you have demand.stupid cheating.tactics Zomato.distance fees and other charges are added for whatever amount we order.too.much greedy zomato.stopping use of your app.,1
Location is not updated time to time. Overall a great app,4
Sudden increase in delivery charges and prices .,5
very innovative decor with heart touching food.. Mind-blowing word is very small for this..,5
Very nice and affordable . Keep it up,5
Worst app not responding in time neglecting and the customer service is worst the way of they responding,1
worst app. didn't solve problem with the transactions and support service is worst,1
Displaying the location of the outlets is one of the good things.,4
Really tx so much Zomato.. When I was in lock down Zomato was fully helped me.. I really love u r app such a great app.. Tx Zomato team,5
customer care not suportive. Delivery boys are good. Today also I have raised the concern and they could not able to understand or give resolution..,1
Safe and fast delivery ... Loved it...,5
Superb app and my experience is great with zomato salute to the riders.,5
Good App. Easy to maneuver. But Zomato Membership is useless.. overall gain is ZERO!!!!,5
It is easy to order from restaurant and so many profits,4
Very fast and politely served my food. Thank you.,5
"Rate five because they are showing good response, if you did any mistake while placing order.. compare to other service provider",5
Delivery good but product is not good taste and qty very less,4
"Fast, timely, user friendly and discounts every time",4
Worst experience.. Got food after 1.5hours that too after multiple follow-up and food was still chilled not even warm,1
Appreciating the effort of Zomato and their delivery walets for delivering foods under any climats to the needy people.Conisdering the latest incident happened in Bangalore (Hitesha Vs Kamaraj) request Zomato to give option to Zomato walets to record live vedio/audio while delivery if needed.This will defenitly boost the moral of emp.Other wise these type of socialmedia decrepit ladies will raise false argumets and will cause reputation damage initially for the company as well as employees.,5
Great app hot food in just 27 minutes seriously 27 minutes rate it 5 stars very good app seriously,5
Latest update to UI is very disappoining.,5
Very bad app ..very complicated app for customer not customer friendly,1
Delivery as on time good service,5
Bakwaas app . After 60 mins of waiting . Driver said restaurant has opened just now . Pathetic app,1
Here is my first zomato ordered but I'm not satisfied that food i was ordered from yesterday chicken hakka noodles nd brownie with ice cream but that hotel mountain high delivery food only egg hakka noodles nd only brownie without ice cream nd i can pay every extra charge i want den i dont want work with your app,1
I am really depressed by charges applied by Zomato. 1. Food charges are more than price available at restaurant. 2. Zomato is charging taxes and delivt charges. 3. More than Zomato is also instructed to their delivery boy for mutli order. 4. Reason being I received my order 30-40 minut late. It's really heights of shamless. Resolve this problem as soon as possible. Otherwise I will take necessary action. Do it fast.,1
Worst food app....they try to pass time once you raise cancel request and then back off.,1
Fast Delivery And Reasonable Price only Issue With Filter Veg and Non Veg List,4
Delivery charges is very very costly and Very poor experience 😡😡😤😤👿👿💩,1
Such worst customer service have very bad experience never suggest you to use this app because they will sucks on your emergency time,1
"Most unreliable. You will place an order, pay, wait, just to see the order not delivered.",1
"Extremely bad experience, pathetic food delivery service..with equally matching inefficient dumb customer service..",1
"Zomato has always been very professional. Excellent staff, excellent management 5 stars!",5
I just want say that I like there services. It's fast and clean.,5
Very bad service ....they deliver food too late.,1
I'm in PDY but i order to CG. 1st time I'm use in this app. It's very good. Delivery time and taking method all is good. Thanks,5
If I have 0 or worse than that. I would be happy to rate you such worse. No response from your support team for one of my bad order for 3 long contacts. They will start the chat and wont respond.,1
The food orderd usually come late as per the given time .,1
Service was good. Delivery boy behaviour was good.,4
Thank you Zomato for bringing a smile on my kids face on her birthday today. We need a little light during these dark times. Thank you again to the valets who are working tirelessly to make people happy.,5
"Zomato listens to its customers,i am happy. my suggestion is to give offer on all resturents rotation wise.",5
Very bad experience Automatically ordered and when I cancell they deducted the amount New way of cheating peoples,1
I ordered biryani in sadda adda through zomoto it's horrbile experience. They have charged 170 rs bt it's not evn worth for 30 rs . Not even single chicken piece is not good . And taste also horrible. I just threw this biryani after tasting it pls don't order in zomoto,1
Totally waste i purchased zomato promode but it is showing promocodes isn't applicable on this order totally waste of time and money .,1
"Worst experience off late, all are inflated prices, non sense taxes, useless discounts, wrong orders, am deleting it.",4
Such a biased and pathetic application. For the same location on my phone there is no offer and on the other number of my home is having a lot more.,1
"I love the App, using Since 2018, Great Service. Great Going",5
Very rude behaviour of online chat assistance. Did you really respect customers or just trying to fool them. Not everyone is here for your free food. Atleast try to understand the concerns ur application is having.,1
"worst experience and always take more delivery charges than the cost of food ,",1
Fast delivery and good food,5
Fast delivery and great offers,5
"I wish I could give no star, ordered food at MASA Virar almost 2 hrs no news horrible service charging 36 rs for delivery, dissapointed The above review was for the dissapointed experience but I need to say KUDOS to Zomato, I received a apology email and s complimentary voucher from Zomato the next day of my complaint. I am truly impressed not just for the voucher instead the prompt response from Zomato, highly impressed thank you zomato for the costumer service provided",5
"I didn't expect from Zomato... in my last order they packed poor quality veg noodles in aluminum foiled, without fork or ketchup terrible experience.",1
"Have to deselect auto tip option each time , l prefer to pay tip after delivery",2
Fast delivery and reliable,5
Zomato - One app for all types of hunger solutions of different people. Offers needs to be worked on a little more and rest all is good and awesome! Cheers guys 😉❤️..,5
Excellent High speed quick delivery .Delivery boy Zomato gentle and soft behaviour.,5
If there is an issue with the order then they don't give proper resolution.,1
This is the amazing aap. Delivery timeline is very good and fast.,5
Hopeless service never expected such a hopeless service. Bastards...,4
I love this app because it is very use full and even offer is also applied...,5
Good service and quick response on complaint.,4
"Customer service is awful, pretty much no matter what happens they'll say ""they understand but can't do anything""",1
"Ignoring customer message and cant rply on chat or not solving customer problem ,very very bad condition",1
"Very worst Delivery. After been waiting for an hour in hungry, simply said order get cancelled. And Customer care fellow also very rude.Also we can't speak in our mother language with the customer care.",1
Very very good service and very best app,5
"Wow experience, especially the option of gifting foods to dear ones.. Super Zomato",5
"Pathetic. The delivery guy cancels within 1 minute, without reaching address in south delhi. On top of it, the guy on chat is of no help. He will harass you even more by saying, he cannot do anything. No option to call back, or ask to connect with delivery guy. No refund. Only harassment.",1
They don't even reply us. Chep service. I ordered fried momos and I got raw momos uncooked. When I go to Zomato support section literally I waited for 4 hours but still they didn't even replied. I don't recommend Zomato. Please don't install. I have experience of 3 years. Don't install. They don't give you customer service. I lost my money on waste food. Don't ever install this app.,1
Delays in dilevery of order... Due to greedy intention of zomato by maximising profit through giving multiple orders to delivery valet,1
pathetic service and also they don't take any responsibility for the food they deliver. You order from somewhere else and they will deliver food from somewhere else. totally dissatisfied and disappointed!!!,1
"Easy to handle, lot of options from lot of restaurants.",5
Too late Service...I am not satisfied with your service due to service issue i.e. such a one hour....to receive my order..,1
All the restaurants must accept orders everytime Otherwise its a good app,4
"affordable, good quality, spill proof packaging",5
Great service..quick delivery and great food quality,5
Very nice suberb app easy to eat something cheap and best with coupon offers by Zomato,5
I loved zomato.The delivery person is very fast and polite.,5
Good service even if the restaurant doesn't match your order,4
Zomato delivery charges are high. they may be losing orders for this reason.,4
Hassle free delivery and wide variety of food available anytime.,5
Delivery charges is minimum 60 Rs plus the delivery boy ask directly for 20/30 Rs Tip. I mean the delivery cost is more than the actual product and food cost,1
Poor service and very late delivery 1st time of my order and causing very bad impact,1
Excellent service provided all year long.,5
Worst app. Cooking instruction are never followed and grievances are never resolved.,1
"It been more then an hour for order placement, guys who suppoto pick the order has changed and resturant guy is not picking up the ph. Who is responsible for such delay. Really pathetic service seriously. Need to improve alot to gain customer trust",1
order mismatch. Delivery boy forgot to pick complete order from the restaurant. Poor customer care support and no direct line number to speak with an executive. No one answers available online numbers.,5
It's way better than swiggy Once you get used to it. I hope they keep on upgrading and growing,5
It would be great if I could get to order from few better places as options are very less right now to order,4
"Easy to use....makes life easy when we are hungry ,",5
Had a good experience need to improve more in terms for ordering .,4
"Rates and taxes are too much. If compaired with, shops rate",3
"waste app . delivery boy did mistake , see last month I have order a food in zomato app. The delivery boy came and call in front of the gate, I went to pick the food by cash and delivery boy told me I have no change, so u bring me the change, he told the word very harshly then, I brought the change he didn't accepted it. Y Means the change are coins, the delivery boy did mistake but (zomato online food app), whenever I order the food the app shows me (no cash on delivery, pay in online) .",1
Fantastic to use and one of the best Service provide is cod.,5
Horrible app . Robs the money and doesnot even deliver the food items. Never gonna install this app in this lifetime,5
Worse response by customer care... Delivery executives need proper training to check items before delivery and also on how to talk to customers,1
"These guys are smart, the ""Arriving in 12 Mins"" stays that way for an hour, good thing none of us users have brains otherwise somebody would notice it.",1
"Good navigation, wide choice & quick billing.",5
Good enough Please reach on delivery time estimated . Over all superb,4
Stop with the cheesy notification ads already. Please. I beg you.,1
There was buy 2 and get 1 burgers ₹188 with delivery charges... But I received only 2 burgers,1
Terrible service. I got raw food and couldn't even eat it. I had to throw it away. I ask zomato for refund 6 times but they didn't gave me my money back for the food which i couldn't even eat. You robbed my money and not willing to refund it back. I just want my refund.,1
Worst...the whole order came late...there is no number to connect...no toppings with the late delivered order... Please do not charge Money of you cannot deliver properly..the delivery person rudely said - 500 pizza ka order bada tha isiliye tumhe late diya...what is this behavior.. is our money free. I need my refund..else will lodge a complaint in consumer court..high time you people are cheating but still taking full money,1
Simply Best App in the Town. Great Deals with Great Service.,5
"Super fast delivery, super offers, quality service",5
Fraud promo code does not apply while checkout all the restaurants show promo not applicable while checkout despite of showing codes in available codes..,2
My issue got sorted out. Also had ordered on Zomato and which were delivered well on time,5
Very efficient delivery and wide coverage of restaurants,5
Tasty food . But little late dilevery . Amount problem in change .good,5
Chapter 2 One of the best Retro dining outlet at mani Square... The continental dish and buffet spread is amazing... We enjoyed last evening so much..,5
It is a great experience by using this and the offers availed are to much great.. 👍,5
"Satisfied with delivery time, got delivery within 25 minutes after ordered. Thanks",4
"Why do you have a zomato gold version anyway, it costs all the same ! Pathetic. Regretting having paid extra for the gold subscription.",1
It is very good app for fastest delivery of food any type non veg or veg .,5
It is a awesome app to order food.,5
"The worst service.. You people are playing some mind game by showing 40% and 50% discount.. Did any one asked you to give discounts?? Then why you are giving unfaithful discounts and why you are collecting more delivery charges as well as restaurant charges.. And the question is, are you giving the same amount to the rider which you gave collected from me??",1
Zomato is the only place from where I can order my food anytime and it always gives delivery on time. I will share same on my Instagram account leenazlife 😍👍,4
All local restaurants are there which serve authentic traditional food.,5
The app works perfectly fine. Can't blame the devs if some restaurant sucks.,4
U order things from a shop and they give something else nd the issue is also not resolved..,1
On Food Category.. Zomato should categories properly on Veg and Non Veg Food.,4
"The chat is useless, it does not lets you write your review and when you do, they don't respond",1
"Very bad service not useful for ordering good food and their service also talking rudely and not give good service, also there restaurant are bad...... Really not good for health",1
"App crash always , imagine you are when you straving for the food.",1
Very quick and accurate in delivering the food,5
Every order after 9:30 is always delayed... Don't know if Zomato follows up with restaurants..,2
Incredible work. They have served food to crores of people and given jobs to thousands. Keep up the work.,5
Good and useful app It's very much use full on urgent times..,5
I used to enjoy meal for one option but now it's going it was very good option for bachelor,2

"I had a query regarding my order. The adviser said that the money is been added to Zomato Wallet, but, it was 0, nothing was added, just a false information was provided to me.",1
Third class service. Very late delivery. They come on cycle. Don't have even scooter. Swiggy is far better,1
Superb and very quick service 👏,5
"Zomato charges too much money for example a certain hotel sells biryani for 120rs Zomato will charge the same 150rs along will extra delivery charges and taxes, better to directly go to hotel and buy yourself or do dunzo.Also they remove your honest opinion/review.",1
very good for ordering food and finding best outing restaurants,5
"No better offers, they always are promoting zomato gold, etc. Should atleast gice away offers on a weekly basis.",1
"The worst company, worst customer service, worst delivery. So its like placed an order for a simple ice cream, the delivery guy comes in front of my house and cancels the order and says I have placed a cancellation request. After which Zomato charges me 305 rupees as a penalty charge for no fault of mine. Then customer service team hang up twice and the repenstative named srabona Kamble was so rude as if we asked her to give her food Lol😂 She kept saying cannot transfer to manager and kept disc",1
Works great but sometimes charge 50% extra plus delivery,5
it's loot a item like kulcha is to be maximum 50/00 rupees they are charging around 250/00.,1
Waiting for food last 01 hours and still showing 07 minute since 15 minutes,1
The service is completely pathetic. They make delivery promises. They really can't handle business post a real hour,1
Worst support they send missing items.. spilled food and don't even refund,1
Love the experience so far.. very easy to use.. and keeps your updated,5
Now Zomato charging 45% more than actual rate in Hotel... This too much and also 50 to 70 rupee delivery charge...,1
Very bad delivery are taking longer time for a cup of tea and snaks.,1
Fastest delivery & Good service,5
Best app. Provided great service during covid lockdown.,5
Great app with good discount on food,5
Delivery of food is always delayed by almost 15-20 mins.,1
Delivery chgs are exorbitant. I m just opp to Murugan idli shop. We ve to think twice before placing the order. Chgs should be proportionate to distance. Customers are fleeced.,1
"I am v much disappointed with the service last 3 of my deliveries were worst , and I wasn't able eat my food , everything came out of box to cover , I had sent a feedback and no one responded to me",1

Just two stars for customer care executive support.... Otherwise its third time my order gets cancelled as there is problem assigning a delivery partner for my order,2
No1 to take your complain Zomato...worst app according to my experience...i have screenshots to share how they r ignoring my compaints.,1
Delivery is always late by atleast an hour without fail.,1

The service is so good reach food in time.,5
"You guys play a major role in our life, especially in the life of bachalor and even if they are working. Because of your service that too late night service. You guys give a smile in our face when we order food and that's is delivered at time. Thanks you all for service and wishing you all the best....",5

You can't force customer to order the minimum amount ofborder. If it is so customer will move out to other delivery apps,1
"This is my third order, but never received as i ordered and always delay in delivery.",1
Delivery is very fast and fresh food I am happy this service good app,3
Always cross check price with Restaurant. Zomato always overcharged,1
"Such a failure support chat from Zomato, not giving response",1
"Dear Zomato, when you are changing for delivery, than why the delivery personal directly come to our place, why they delivered multiple order same time",1
Amazing app for Food delivery.,4
Good app experience and easy to find the restaurant,4
They have delivered otherthan what i have ordered and when i rasied a querie they are not responding. Very worst service i have recived.,1
Excellent service on time .,5
So disappointing . They weren't even ready to talk to their customers. Facing a lot of problems from past few weeks and i bought their pro which i feel now is total waste because Zomato does not care about their customers...,1
The worst application ever. They stole my money and its been since december 31st promising to refund it back and there is nothing.. Dont ever order with them.,1
"waiting for food for 2 hours after order. Today had another experience,Ordered full Chicken Tandoori(8pices), Insted of that they delivered small 8 pices fried chicken and they are not ready to take back the iteam and refund.",1

"Very quick service, I appreciate zomata.... Time keeping service",5
"Worst app ever irritating interface, thought of giving 0 star but that was not possible",1
"If u r taking subscription ,it's the worst one, never ever waste money on pro sub.",1
Food was testy but delivery service was very rough.,5
One and only Zomato !! Always happy with services and discount coupons..,5
Zomato is good but need improvement in service quality quantity and delivery,5
Don't download this just download SWIGGY instead because there has barely been any offers... It really sucks to see only bank offers... Because not everyone will have that bank account... 👎👎👎,1
"Great experience with Zomato, plople know about Timmy's food address!",5
"If there was any option to posting images in the play Store regarding Zomato,. I have such chats of Zomato agents giving no values to me. Shame.",1

Delivery boys are working hard and you guys need to fix ur app as the order gets placed anywhere around the corner which is not right..petrols price is touching skies. Please have some pity on the delivery boys n fix ur app so that my order is placed around my location n not to the other side of the world where the delivery have to come so far.. I spoke to a delivery guy n I saw tears in his eyes. I told him sorry and thanks to Zomato for this mess .. fix it guys,1
Very Good Service...the delivery person was very polite,5
Good but GPS system should be rearrange.,5
Its of no use they accept payment. Don't deliver the order and keep payment stuck till 4-5 days,1
Got a stone in the dish from Fresh Menu and the zomato customer executive is so careless in responding to queries.,4
I specialy like the promocode given by Zomato.We enjoy High quality food at cheap price.,5
Excellent service however delivery charges not to be charged pl,5
Service is Very fast and on time delivery.,4
Experience was good but I'm so disappointed with Zomato for firing kamaraj without a proper enquiry! Hire the guy back !!,4
"Service is not reliable. Whenever you required most, the order is not delivered. The riders team is not professional. They are not training either their riders properly or hiring unprofessional people. They do provide refunds as an apology on cancellation but what would you do with refunds when you needed the food.",1
Great experience and value for money options,5
Fraud and worst customer service agents Applied coupon code 'Visa' and around 1 week already passed but still no resolve from customer service agents 🤬🤬😡😠,1
"Delicious, on time delivery... Tq to zomato.. Keep it up..",5
No on time delivery. Waste if ordering from this.,1
Love the app easy to use. If you can add amazon pay that would be great,4
"Use SWIGGY!! The only way to have you a better service and make sure your food is not just safe, but also with the right order instructions.",1
Same food from the same restaurant is 43 rupees costlier than swiggy on a total purchase of Rs 160. Really surprised 😅😅. Doesn't deserve to have received more than 1 rating as everyone now is thinking on cost cutting and Zomato is engaged in looting the customers.,1
Packaging and spillage is your issue. why the hell customer has to pay for it. I'm wasn't even demanding for the money i was just demanding my food. Worst ever experience with the Zomato. Never had such experience with Zomato.,1
nice app with decent discount . recommend it to all,3
Why packaging charges are added extra.. packaging are always inclusive,1
"Worstest service ever in my life no proper resolution no proper apology ever time I order one or the other issue , incorrect order , order cancellation , order missing , if we chat with executive they send same repeated forward messages and stress us even more serioualy lots needs to be changed by u guys pls pls don't stress Cust like this even a good nice person will turn to be a mad after having a conversation with u guys seriously never use this app again in life",1
Instant delivery n easy for orders,5
It has good offers and variety to make choice.,5
Worst service ever. These people don't care about there customers just making us fool. I wish I can post the screen shot hare so everyone can know.,1
Good but ordering for first time is bit confusing sply adding breads etc,5
Zomato is a great app for order good quality of food Zomato delivery persons is good experience persons to order fastly to the location it is my I 96 time to zomato app,5

Great app for fastest delivery Always delivery on time,5
Good quality and timely delivery,5
worst one unable to get the duplicate bill even support no helps to get the same,1
Nice service and good app for food delivery.,5
Zomato cheats with their customers. They record wrong location while you place your order. Then they did not deliver the order to their customers. After cancellation of order also they do not repay your money. I made payment via UPI while placing the order and I neither got my order nor refund. Please don't use Zomato. They also don't have customer care number for contacting.,1
Very good delivery with tasty food...&delivery man also good,5
The french fries are really assome. Crispy and also tasty. Its a separate tatse among the other french fries i tryed in Hyderabad..,5
Awesome food and prompt delivery,5
"Update 2 in 2021: I did reach out to Zomato after their comment here, all I got as reply is an automated email. Also, I'm a Pro subscriber. Taking 1 star off. I wish I could give zero stars. Update in 2021: 1 extra star for improvement! Horrible service and appalling policy. Use anything else but this! Yeah. In",1
It take a life time for one delivery Waiting is hectic...32 min rule is sometimes not applicable,2
"Rubbish service. Not worth the time and money. Food is just ok, nothing great.",1

"Good service, swift and prompt",5
Excellent service and fastest delivery service 👏 👍,5
The chat is not properly conveying messages When question on deduction on my money back for PRO offer purchase there was a staggering silence,1
Exceptional service always and great offers.,5
It's a very nice app. We get all the things needed in right time .,5
"Poor service, item not received on time.",1
Waste of money. Zomato is not responsive to customer query. I recieved wrong order but neither the restaurant nor zomato is taking the responsibility.,1
"Poor experience, poor delivery timing and food packing as well as food quality..",1
This app has several issues on offers even if complaint no action taken this happens multiple time,1
service is good. food delivered in time.,5
Superb but taking a lot of money as delivery charges,5
It takes forever to load and crashes all the time,1
Delivery charges are too high,2
"Grt app, easy to use and order.",5
Service is good also Zomato delivery boy is very polite and humble,4

Superb app for ordering food ..I every time order from this app .,5
Guys . Don't order to Zomato App. Delivery boy picked order and number also not reachable . More than half hour waiting No response Zomato side. Plz Zomato shutdown your customer service,1
Very good app for ordering food and good discounts,5
Worse experience. Delivery boy took my order and didn't respond And all they could do is to say sorry. They couldn't even find out where is my order. bty this has happened with me thrice,1
Thanks Zomato specially in this Covid19-4wave time delivering @11:50pm thanks a lot,5

"Awesome, enjoying super fast n efficient service.",5
Worst delivery app ever. They will not refund if the order is cancelled by the restaurant.,1
It's one of the finest apps which basically ai use I like their services nd my experiences are quite ok,5
They will tell u that if order is not delivered on time that order will be free but that's not happening..they are cheating customers by false promises..,1
So great service in difficult time.,5
This Service is very good Service and good timing. Thanks 😊👍,4
"Order is never on time ...never i say never ever it is on time ..everytime theres a delay,, the delivery man never give back one ,two or three rupee back ,,says that noone takes two three rupee back mam,,its just too much disgusting,if you cant return my small amount of penny then why do u make such prices .,,,",3
Best app for odring the food . And this giving me a will closed and Good quality food every time,5
Very good and on time delivery,5
Sometimes it hangs while placing order but otherwise good app,4
It is very useful and helpful app I love this app and there service also,5
I never expected such behaviour from Zomato. Zomato is asking customer to compromise on the food that was not properly delivered.,1
These days it seems that rating given to the restaurants are not true.,1
"Order food online, check reviews and avail great offers on delivery and dining! Whether you’re looking for biryani to feed your desi cravings, soul comforting pizzas and burgers, or even a salad with a cup of chai or coffee, Zomato is the only app you need for the quickest doorstep delivery of your favourites.

"Paid 318 for mutton biriyani, all I got was 2 tiny pieces of mutton, requested them to take the order back and refund the money. They gave me 100 refund. Extremely disappointed with their service. Customer support is not at all understanding. This is not done. If there's a issue with the quality, you need to take the feedback seriously and refund. Why would someone pay 318 for only rice?",1
I had a terrible experience...people assigned for issues do not respond on time...,1
"First thing comes to my mind when I crave for food is ""ZOMATO"". With great offers on every bill gives every middle class customer a great satisfaction.",5
Absolutely lacking customer support. Would rather use swiggy any day over zomato. Very bad service. Very bad delivery people.,1
"Please respect the Zomato delivery guys.. I had missed my phone while taking my order at midnight, it was good on the guy who came and returned my phone. So try to tip the guys on breaking our fast.",5
Discounts are not good the end discount amounts only to the exclusion of taxes in most places. That isn't really a discount is it?,3
The app should check the quality of food before giving them place.,1
"Bad service, you can't cancel order once placed, bad food provided by them",1
I have a nice experiene with zomato and I am so glad to see the delivery service.,5
Poor.service Delivery standards not being maintained. It took one hour to get my order accepted,1
"Why Zomato has kept those restaurants, which can't fulfill order on time ( Domino's Pizza Durgapur ), Bad service, no one picked up call also",1
I am using this aap for 4 month really good food and All the very best of zomato ....,5
Great application but need to add many restaurant.,5
"Service is fast, reliable and diverse.",3
"Just hate the customer service, the person on chat is no more than a robot with automated replies",1
Pathetic customer service. Customer support executive just logs off and ran. No proper solution given nor refund issued for wrong order received,1
"Very bad experience, the support is a joke and the help the restaurant to sheet.",1
"Chat support is useless, it never sorts out the issue",1
"Terrible service and the coupon was not added to my account and they are not even trying to resolve my problem and I think they don't want , they think we are stupid",1
"The best for food delivery app In Kochi, Why? Swiggy and Uber eats won't come to our locality in Kochi And we can have a lot of things in it 𝐇𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐥𝐲 𝐑𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐝",5
"Besides mistake from Zomato driver, the driver (delivery supervisor) told me to cancel the food order and asked how should I get my refund. Chat room kept asking about the photo of the spoiled food (the driver was the witness and he agreed the food spoilage). It wasn't going anywhere. The restaurant came to my rescue, without wasting time sent me my food through careem driver and it was spot on. Hats off to papa murphy. Magic of moment I witnessed that night from papa murphy.",1
Delaying almost all orders in the name of Multi order. Not notified about multi order before ordering.fraud,1
Worste customer care services first of all not have any customer care number and he provide only Chat service its take so much time and also in chat service for reaching customer executive so much BoT questions ask so its take so much time,1
It's very fantastic as it offers a free dilevery on the first order....😍,4
"What is the point of buying 'Pro', if you are going to force the surge charge on me anyway! Come up with better monetization plans Zomato.",1
Poor customer service. Cannot resolve issue according to the problem at hand.,1
Time waste waiting for an oeder from 9:40 its 11 o clock now deleviry boy is not receiving call and chat with support system is not working.,1
i miss the original Zomato Gold plans where it used to be Buy 1 Get 1 .....new Zomato pro plans are not that useful,3
"App is not working, saying something went wrong, unable to place order",1
Really Good service & support by customer service.,5
Delivery boy had not given complete food items and money was not refunded by zomato.,1
You increase the price of the food itself and then again charge delivery fees seperately.,1
Now Zomato is in phase of only earning not customer service. Showing all items after adding 20-40% profit + delivery charges. Wow that's great Zomato,1
money waist and time waist......I got my order delay and in very bad condition...... there was leakage issue...and packaging issue,1
On time delivery. Fresh n Hot. Delivery boy delivered it without any calls or messages. Thank you Zomato,5
Very fast delivery and good service 👍,5
"Shittiest app ever, charges so much extra , nothing beneficial after getting pro, discounts are joke",1
I loved it so much 💗💗 When I am hungry the order will come 10 to 30..mins,5
Delivery partner was very polite and a very good behavior person He delivered very fast,5
"While assigning the 2 orders to one delivery executive, please check the distance and check the route ,if the order is on the way than executive can deliver near by order first",1
On time delivery with best best delivery person.,5
Very bad experience regarding failed transaction n they don't have any customer care no so nobody can make complaint,1
There is no option for cancellation of the order or want to change order.,2
worst delivery and they take almost 2 hrs to deliver food swiggy is far better than this.,1
Excellent tieup with the outlets. Timely delivery by the team,5
Takes really long to load restaurant and transaction details,2
Great experience with heavy discounts on every order,5
Service is worst and no answer for delay ...,1
Very nice and convinient app to order your meal for your doorstep !,5
"Total waste, not loading a single thing...always saying fetching data",1
"Worst service by Zomato..... Humble request to all customer please don't use thz app it's worst app ever... I had faced bad experience as I ordered food for homeparty occasion payed amount via upi .. but didn't received food.after 20 min guy called me asked me to pay extra money liquid cash... I denied to pay cash as I already paid , so they cancelled order .... Worst app ... Zomato should plz shut Ur door if u can't value Ur customer ....",1
Worst experience.I ordered Special Nachos fries and Cheese popper fries from UFO Wakad outlet.But the delivery boy(Akash Suresh Dangde) delivered only nachos fries and told me remaining order will come later and took the full payment.Then I called to UFO customer care they also told me that your full order has been packed in one packet and was dispatch from our side.Zomatos delivery boy cheated with us and gave half order but thanks to UFO refund my money Zomato please verify your delivery boys,1
On time and delivery boy are always well being .,4

This app is very good and I'm happy to zomoto orders ... Customer support ..is excellent and good Thanks ...for zomto,5
Good business to loot public.. After ordering so many orders I came to know that the Thali which I order from tomato at the cost of 390 + delivery +gst rupees and actual site it is available for 240 rupees. Really Rs 150 extra plus delivery charges and gst. Shame on you zomato,1
Excellent. Very fast delivery. Nice experience,5
So now they say that because they are facing high demands you should order more food to place the order... So basically u should order more food and waste it even if u don't want to because Zomato is facing high demand! 😡😡😡😡,1
"I love this app alot😘💜 Fast delivery, polite delivery man and delicious food 😘😘😍😍 Thank you so much Zomato 😊💗",5
"Today Zomato has broke my years of trust as the Valet who was coming for delivery had 98.4 temperature which can be considered as border of fever. When I asked the valet about his temperature, he said no one has checked it and it was updated randomly. We were under impression that for every order valet is being checked before handing over the food. But this is very bad experience and break of years of trust. Had a chat with customer care executive and she also confirmed it was a glitch. It's bad",1
Good and fast. 1 star left as i didn't found the restaurant review,4
My orders are usually tagged with some other order as well and due to this my order delivery time is usually high,1
Speed delivery and very good,5
Good app but delivery is sohigh costy😱😔,3
GPS live tracking system not good. Delivery service superb 👌,4
A very good costomised application and user freindly,5
Rlly nice app my food is always there when said and overall just great,4
Personal experience is very bad.. Rude behaviour of delivery boy ...not recommended bcz delivery boy is very rude and misbehaving...,1
Good app... I have a great experience while ordering food from Zomato....,5
Speed delivery and love this app,5
Can you please remove that zoom sound. It's scary when not expected,4
Very fast and quickly service,5
By simply ordering the food by N-number of restaurants with their ratings one can experience the Zomato and it's fast delivery.,5
"if i could give minus star i would ,but there is no option for that , you are taking extra money for delivering food at home yet u fail to do that on time .",1
"Zomato had very worst customer service they will never reply to customers after staying for 2-3 hours also, they are intentionlly Keeping customers on hold for long time. I really hate Zomato",1
Very poor. Not having cancel option in order summary,1
Unable to give location and its goes somewhere,3
Good experience with a Quality and service of Tofu the kitchen,4
Easy to taste from any hotel without rush. Just order it and taste,5
It is the best application for food delivery which ruling the entire country with its taste....big thumbs up,5
"Not satisfied ,even afte adding few additional instructions doesnt respond to instructions given by us,",1
Worst app...due to lockdown people's are unable to eat outside due to this the greedy Zomato increased the charges of every order ...#Ashamed...,1
"Need to release more offers closely related to user's payment modes, not with payment modes users don't have",1
Pathetic Support. They made me feel like iam a liar for telling them about missing items.,1
The most pathetic customer service. They never take responsibility of the order and just apologize without taking any action.,1
I had order my dinner with zomato at Biriyani Kazana by paying 253. My order has been canceled by Zomato or their delivery partner or the hotel by saying I didn't responded to their calls. But the fact is I didn't received any calls. And I was waiting for the delivery with my friend at the street. I felt very bad the way Zomato treated me in this order.,1
"The delivery is fast,but the app is terrible #Needs improvement",3
Hi I would like to highlight you people how zomato is not following Covid norms.. I had placed an order and aftr the dleivery agent was assigned the page(zomato app screen) clearly stated that the temperature of zomato delivery agent was checked 12 hours ago..... Have a screenshot as well for the same Stafe safe guys from ordering....,1
Food delivery was delay most of the time.,2
"Service for the customer is fine. But, service for the delivery agent is just horrible",3
Good Food and Good Delivery Service.,5
hell service I am trying to connect with the executive but not getting proper support and no one is ready to resolve my query very unhappy with Zomato third class service I am not going to suggest anyone to order something from Zomato,1
When i had a order...I had call to delivery boy...delivery boy said he was away to restaurant 6 km and my location toward to restaurant 4km better i can take away without wasting my time.... my suggestion if u r hugry please don't use zomato...one more thing please respect zomato delivery boy not for a company,1
"They never refund the full amount ,if something wrong in food.",1
"Still have to update,no option for buying a item from 2 different hotels in single time",3
"What happened to it..i have been trying to give order for 2 months, it is written that currenty not accepting orders, please resolve the issue as soon as possible",1
"Worst experience on 06.04.2021, parcel containing food worth Rs 199.50 never reached me. Total wastage of the money.",1
I have noticed Fast delivery Safety precautions taken by Zomato valet Well organized It's really a wonderful app,5
Always delay in delivery...there is big gap between time showing and time deliver,1
Very bad delivery service and customer care chat is also not working,1
Prompt delivery with tracking & options of varieties to choose from...,5
"They messed up my order, admitted that their system was faulty, but refused to refund my order and instead asked me to forgive them. Trademark bad service brought to you by their parent company talabat. On top of all that, when I mentioned I will no longer use their service if I were not reimbursed, they arrogantly didn't care. Bring back an open market, support their competitors, teach them humility. I contacted the email below, same nonsense I spoke about above. I should pay for their mistake",1
Awesome I would give it 5 star but you need to improve some things on zomato,4
"Right on time, no complaints, smooth process.",5
Awesome service and food delivery on time ...you guys rock,5
Nice app there are many discounts and the food is delicious too😋😋,5
Fast delivery.....and delivery boys are behave good,5
Always delayed delivery. Waste of time.,1
super list of restaurants...good offers use it 3-4 times a week now,5
"Customer care service, late delivery, zomato have no control over it's delivery service, food quality and quantity",1
There is a lot issue of location Every time I have to inform ur zometo pplz where to come because even after adding address locations shows some different place And ur ppl not reading the address even,1
Most third class restaurant ever... The quality of biriyani is very poor. The taste was so bad and the mutton piece was also so bad and wastage of money. Don't go there atleast save that money and give it to some poor people.,1
Very good app and delivery is very fast thank you zomato,5
Good App ! Easy navigation !,5
Such a waste application I contacted customer care support they are not even responding properly regarding my orders such a ridiculous behavior,1
"My order was not delivered properly by ""Anjapar"" hotel. Zomato gave refund of 200 for 580 worth of order and that too will be added to only the zomoto account. Give money to a person in Hungry that to after 2 - 7 working days... No proper response from Zomato chat assistant and there is no phone number to call and talk to anyone in Zomato help centre",1
Loved the app😁 But tracking is not accurate!!,5
This app is so nice but for the first time it canceled my order and I don't like this thing and that's all,5
Good service and fast delivery..,5
Fantastic for my personal experience with Zomato and thanks for it,5
Sometime deliver low quantity than order or some time missing add on things.,1

Good and fast service,5
zomato is a platform where you can order yummy food from your nearby restaurants!,5
I had got my percel 30 mins after I ordered it. It is really nice delivery 👌. Thanks to zomato.,5
"Order decline after 2 hours, miss behaviour from restaurant after payment...they thought that they feed us free....",1
Pathetic service. Rider or restaurant doesn't. Respond once order is delivered .. Even customer care is very helpless.. instead they refund 30 rupess for order of 580.. This is cheap.. bbye you lost a customer for lifetime.. it was my second order here..,1
I am not satisfied with zomato app it is not showing any pro tab and have the pro code and it has time limit so what to do now i hop zomato will solve this within 24 hours,2
Delivery is too late and higher charge,1
"If you are a pro member u cant order most of restourant as they shows cant deliver if u normal client they will deliver,even their customer care hasn't any ans for this,pathatic service",1
They steal money by way of delivery charges & surge fee! You rather call the restaurant and order to save ₹80-90.,1
Always provide better service.... happy with collection of restaurants....,5
Very nice food delivery app..,3
Awesome code and service. I am a software engineer and I really respect their hard work,5
Its really economic. Compare with Swiggy..Zomoto charge very less for delivery.,5
Meal for one is not available in this current application I only use that thing in Zomato please add that feature again,1
Great app. Easy to use and smooth!,5
Good and very helpful to fulfil oir need,5
Excellent 👍 This app is very helpful for hungry people 🙄,5
"I ordered from this restaurant because it was showing delivery in 25 min after , delivery person called and asked me to cancel order, i asked why he cut the call then did not lift again, i raised support at zomato , it was automated there was no help they are just refering to call restaurant ,that too no one was lifting. It's worst app .You should close this app if you are providing this much of pathetic service. NO customer support available. #zomato sucks",1
Amazing app very good service with full covid precautions.,5
All ok but supportive executives means helping part needs more.... improvements. Need more restaurants availability for online. I am ZOMATO PRO Member.Especially need to improve dine in billing facility. 7 out 10 restaurants even some five star restaurants dont want to take payment through ZOMATO pro. Wake up zomato team especially for Zomato pro member's dineout payments.,3
Lags.... food keeps showing coming when it's actually out for delivery,2
"Too much charge even to deliver food within 0.5 kms, Atleast they should charge according to the distance.",1
Good and fast service,5

Awesome customer service if you are in trouble with your food.,5
I am so happy with this app..and help full me ..every time..thnq zomato..❤😊,5
"Offers in Pro are just awesome Both, Dine in & Delivery",5
Hello...At first I want to thanks a lot to Zomato Customer care service. Because today I ordered 2 plates potato Biriyani & 2 plates Mutton chaap from Nu sagar restaurant at zomato...That food was rotten & very much bad taste. So I complained zomato customer care chat service...Customer care executive was very good & she did understand my problem very easily...& returned my full refund...I'm very happy for zomato service...& surely I will continue my online food order by Zomato. ❤🙏,5
"I placed the order the quality of food is very very poor. Either you don't know, how to run a business for long time nor have a expert team, who can select the best supplier / vendors from the market. The street vendors can serve better food qulaity from you. I am sure, I'll not place the order in future from Zomato due irresponsible, poor performance of 'Zomato Team"".",1
Worst online food ordering application There is no coordination between the application and the restaurant They just want the money and does not want to deliver the food ..,1
Very Good offer and now affordable plan available.,5
Good experience with Zomato. Service person also good and on time.,4
Chicken lollipop which was ordered few hrs back was of poor quality and it was fully burned was not able to eat so we have throw out the whole pieces out . Sorry to say but your chicken lollipop was not good !waste of money,5
"Delivery was in 20mins, great!",5
Not delivered proper order Poor quality food Not response on complet Packing not properly Zomato not taking action on hotel. Not properly response on costumer complaint,1
Superb app safety and best food delivery,5
They say it's 50 percent off for the first order for a customer but it just for show off it says coupon couldn't be applied all gamble in terms of business,1
If it added special features like good and nice smelled like fresh cooked food.Hope this app would lasts for till my breath cause Zomato only makes my hunger better😅😉,5
"The customer support was very worst, I explained the problem clearly with images and even the restaurant want to cancel the order but zomato support was not at all responding to my request",1
Nice and the prices are not same in each phone,4
Not good service. They did not refund any amount And completely wrong order delivered,1
In new update I am not able to see real time location of delivery person.,2
"I never seen such a bad app , they deducted my money but till now I didnt get any refund , even any proper messages from them , then what is the use of ur customer support system , so please don't buy food from zomato",1
"Superb application, the Best for ordering food online.",5
Just the best food app with nice offers.,5
Not satisfied very cheating business this is if we once ordered & paid cash by online means if we canceled some of emergency means this Zomato company won't refund even they are not capable to handle the customers even to retifive the problems,1
Good experience till the date. But they can improve as they r growing higher.,4
"Excellent service, and very fast service",5

"Great app and great offers, love it👍 So love it",5
"the delivery guys are so cheap. i ordered an pizza. there were no pizza mix and herbs. on talking to restro, they told that they have sent it in the package and to ask the delivery guy. i am never gonna order anything again.",5
All your promos/offers r fake marketing & no discount benefit to the customer in real terms . u give discount on oneside & take it back on the other hand by increasing the service/tax/other charges. Also few vendors increase the cost of the items in order to give the discount. Customers not getting real benefit from these promos/discounts. Zomato is cheating the public unlike their earlier days. Too many addl cost without any real benefit for customer,1
Delivery was quick and delivery boy was well mannered.,4
Good on-time delivery by Zomato,5
Awesome Food quality with in time delivery. 💯💯🔯🔯🔯🔯🔯,5
Great service...very much improved,5
Gud. near by a2b at thiruvottiyur shall be more quick items will be fresh,5

Good service for zomato and very fast delivery good service for only Zomato,5
Horrible service ...items are missing in the order,1
Loved the service...jst show some humanity and give the job back to the viral delivery man...,4
How come zomato charged on same order multiple times??? And how come they don't have any customer care to raise payment related disputes????,1
Good and prompt service all the time.,5
Quite great experience with Zomato! Delivery on time .,5
Cheating us with the prices as the real price is pretty less in the actual menu and then they are giving us discounts,1
"Excellent food, this restaurant is home based and food is prepared in home with heigen , and excellent taste",5
I have received opened order and I don't know what's wrong with zomato and it's delivery guys this is the worst app I've ever used and when I called zomato delivery guy he said I don't know and cut my phone.,1
Worst service and there's no proper response from the customer service team. Least bothered about the customers.,1
Fast service...Easy and multi options.,4
"In these covid times, zomato turns out to be the only good thing happening.",5
Collecting more amount as delivery charges for near by restaurant as well ....very bad,1
They don't send your order on time for one hour they show you the same time your order is preparing.,2
"I always prefer Swiggy over Zomato due to its customer care service , smoothness and value for customers. Neither they give an option to cancel an order . Let me share with you a very interesting story ... Once I ordered a burger worth Rs.50 from Burger king along with two other burgers . The burger worth Rs.50 was missing on delivery due to which I contacted the customer service with all the pics and formalities required but a refund was not given and the process was too slow and sluggish ...",1
"Awesome app , good food variety ,",5
Very useful to order the food,5
I'm not satisfied with this app. Yesterday night I ordered 1 chicken biryani and 1 egg biryani but I received 2 chicken biryani's but still Zomato guys are not responded for my query worrest service compare to other services....,1
Love the service of zomato. Some tyms problm occurs but all fingers r not same. So doesnt matters,5
Service is good but delivery charges are more,4
Very good app for who don't know cooking,5
Charging Exorbitant fees for delivery but delivered ALWAYS LATE ...wish could rate ZERO STARS,1
You can't ask people to buy extra just because the restaurant is in high demand. Very high prices compared to restaurant,1
Very perfect and cheapest,5
It's an awesome app works perfect for foodies like me.,5
"Every time payment fails, delay in delivery and worse customer care.",1
Food not fresh.not good.old.tasteless.no value for money.selecting this place is mistake.,1
If take commission from restaurants. If spillage issue you need to even refund. What's the use for taking pro membership. Time to move on,1
Service is very good very safe side... Thank you Zomato for your great service and give some offers to us your customers...,5
"Waste customer service, they don’t listen their customers voice, they will sort our issues according to there convenience. Pathetic customer service.",1
Nice deleivry timing and good offer discount,5
App is Awesome but Delivery timings mismatched several time.,4
Food is so tasty fresh and delivered on time,5
I ordered food and coke. Only food was delivered. Order was a COD. The restaurant didn't provide coke but charged for it. Customer service also pathetic. Customer service doesn't do anything. Didn't even refund. Instead gave a promo code. Now that's fraud.,1
Worst service provided by zomato and the restaurant linked up with zomato. Tye restaurant charged 632 for pathetic food sent by restaurant. The biryani house - the parcel had boiled rice cooked in ghee.. with no chicken pcs and egg biryani had 1 single boiled egg.... Charged 632 and zomato is givinf refund of 200... I would request zomato to keep 200 also and stop fooling customers... I wish it had an option to post images as well,1
"All food wasted , box are break . And too loose",1
Worst food delivery app with least interested customer care executive to assist the cust-O-mar. They literally kill you with unempathtic responses and resolutions. Bribe you with food discount coupon to give better ratings. Disappointment😞,1
It's very use full to order when we hungry.and also we see many items in zomoto food cart,5
awesome food.lot of variety. will order again for sure.,5
This app is just pay more amount and get food but never on time never trustworthy never tasty,1
The app is good for traveless foodies and good to save time,5

"This app very nice tell you workers that run their vehicles very fast I have seen so many people of your company zomato they are running very fast on bikes ,so please tell them that you life is important not our food ok travel slow .",5
"I wanted to order non veg but your app was forcing me to make choice in between veg and egg , you also force customer to order more .its a shame on you that in covid lockdown you want exploit .management is totally fake should be sacked including marketing head. Incompetent guys",1
Delivery the food fast and easily locates the places,5
"Fabulous with the food ,delivery and price",5
"Many times I have seen delivery service is very bad, they are very unprofessional. And customer support does not refund money into source account.",2
Please use the google map in its original look the display of the map u use is a bit not good.,3
"D order took more than an hr to b delivered as I think delivery person was carrying more than 1 delivery to b delivered in d same complex which makes d other person's food go cold n awful,disgusting.",1
Wonderful experience with order placement and delivery,5
Some food items are costly compared to swiggy even from the same shop,3
It is an amazing app I can order food from wherever I want,5
The app is good but the pro benefits have been reduced to almost negligible as compared to last year,3
Very bad support team they tell me they will contact within 24/48 hour but its 72 hours still they don't contact me to solve my problem,1
Good service and best quality of items,5
Abnormal delay in delivery because multiple orders on same person at the same time.,2
"There is no customer support, no call center in app chat does not reply. My order was not delivered and vallet rudely Said talk to Zomato and there is noone to talk at Zomato.",1
Very good customer service and on time delivery,4
"Just didn't pick up the delivery guy's call Only seconds after came to call back again my order was cancelled I had to re order it again, bull ship",1
Worst service ever. They charge you cancellation charges even if it is not your fault.,1
Useless app. Keeps crashinf and you loose on your zomato credits.,1
Nice service . Good to see such kind of improvement/awareness during covid 19 period,5
Overall nice easy app to use with great deals..,5
Always orders grt delayed And we don't get any regret from zomato this us the worst things If you want to go for dinner you have to order more than 2hours before because zoma has the most poor service and timing ahead,2
quick service and the delivery guy was also nice to us,5
"Waste of money. Fraud, I ordered twice ND food quality is too much low and not given the right food. Swiggy is better than zomato.",1
Its a good app but a advance order feature would be much helpful.,4
"Absolutely love it, but yes there is a room of improvement for sure.",4
Your old rider was good.but your new riders are unprofessional.your rating going down because of your new riders. Old riders are experienced person.they will give you highest rating.because old is gold.think about that.,1
"With recent experiences from Behrouz Biryani itself, I'm giving you maximum available stars. Behrouz Biryani,Vizag is simply awesome which is doing finest recipes with great accompaniments and hygenic packing. Overall Zomato is working great now a days. Thumbs Up guys..",5
Horrible experience. Going to uninstall once I get my food delivered..,1
Wonderful Experience. This app is very useful for working women.,5
In these difficult times Zomato is like a blessing.,5
Good and best offers... And good response for any issues,5
First pick for any and every food ordering need.,5
Very bad experience. Zomato had me wait for the order for almost an hour or so for three times in a day.. and chat section guy also said its not in his hands. So who is responsible for assigning a valet. Sleeping without food because of zomato.. post corona worst services,1
Zomato has stopped giving good offers like before and they unnecessary charge delivery charge even when the location is within 1km. They are behind you for the pro membership .,3
On time delivery and genuine delivery... Honestly I liked it...,4
I searched vegan ice cream and the product delivered is made out of milk solids. Vegan means vergeterian product made out of non dairy products. Highly disappointed.,1
Misleading chat support intended to keep customers confused and close support,3
Great offers. Keep adding on more reasonable offers during this pendamic.,5
good excellent food and service,5
I made an online transaction but the delivery guy was asking for offline payment too and I chatted with zomato but they aren't giving any response? Worst experience ever,2
Not having offers that much for new users but the service is good at emergency.... Thankyou,3

Great timing and fast delivery,5
Cancelled order without even informing the customer and kept us waiting.,1
Problem only with cash on delivery because of change,4
"It's been more than a week still not received refund, no customer care cell to contact for anything",1
There shud be more offers for people who order regular and either the application is slow,3
Easy & effective to use. Serves the purpose very well!!,5
"Ordered chicken biryani 4 to 5 times earlier from this restaurant taste is good.. Thought of trying again the same but today in the chicken biryani I ordered, salt is too much in the biryani couldn't eat at all..",2

Zomato is doing fraud it's showing something else on app and delivering something else.and not agree to returning my amount back after complaining.,1
Delivery charges are very high,4
Disgusting app I have ever seen shows all restaurants are closed every time I open the app Don't download it or recommend for anyone,1
It's good to see how zomato is improving it's quality ... But y don't they take orders from dominos .... Still disaaponited,3

Taxes are very high. Earlier the app was very good,2
Very fast service and maximum discount,5
Best delivery executives and very fast delivery.,5
So nice about stern response and ordering plus delivery.,5
"The support needs a vast improvement. They are not very responsive at times and get a reply after nearly 20 minutes. Sometimes the order takes too long to arrive. They just issue an apology saying the order is late, it will arrive shortly while it arrives all cold. If it arrives later than the stipulated time customer should be immediately given assistance. And please take the feedbacks seriously.",2
Worst due to there bugs in there system there orders get cancelled by them self even you don't touch,2
Good and fast service,5
Customer support is hopeless . They keep transfering my chat to another agent multiple times but no conclusion .,1
Portion Size was half of what I used to get .. I guess the 50% promo code did the magic👎,3
Crashes every time when i search for dishes.,1
Very good service and fast delivery,5

Good app for online foods delivery or process is very simple & easy 😍,5

"First of all, I would like to mention that the name itself is attractive, which made me try their Chaap, Jolly ji was very polite and humble. I will definitely refer and recommend for tastiest and yummiest Chaap and rolls",5
"This app is biased against men! It deliberately feeds into the feminist propaganda & supports women even if they lie at the cost of innocent, hard working poor delivery boys! It does not protect its core employees which are delivery boy from fake customer allegations! Shame i ever ordered from such company!",1
Very useful and trusted food ordering app.,5
"Best app, we can order foods anywhere with cheapest price.",5
very good app and service is so fast an secure love it,5
"I hate this app, more than 2 hours im waiting, no respond from zomato or the restaurant..",1
"1st guy I ordered the food was frustrated and it was clear from his voice. He was very rude to the security guard who was just doing his job. 2nd guy was all about rating. He handed it as if he didn't care and while his back was facing me, the guy is like sir rating daal do. If you need goodrating, be humble and courteous. I always have better experience with guys who deliver for Swiggy. They are polite and never talk about rating",1
Location and delivery spend more time,4
Very good app and any time delivery good,5
I always get my food on time so good app for the last timers,5
Delivery is good in perfect time or before estimate time. Tq zomoto.,5
Everything is good in the app but why do it sends so many push notifications... I m tired of it..,1
Much slow customer service and variety (at times) as compared to swiggy.,2
Great. good deliver and nice food packaging,4
Really good delivery is very fast and safe nice.,5
"not that much good, have many shortcomings, many delivery boys didn't respond well.. I don't even get my order... the worst app",1
Pathetic app... They did not refund to me.. I mean the food was all tasteless not even the taste of salt i had... And they had rated the restaurant 4.6.. Seriously!!!,1
Unable to see any restaurants therw is no too many resturant like compare to swiggy,1
the white sauce pasta of kha k dekh was so tempting n delicious. Must try this one you gonna love it for sure 🥰,5
As per Zomato technical glitches is Noone fault and so even if wrong items are sent due to that nothing can be done about it,1
Good service delivery boy was wearing mask and was very politely speaking,5
Best services... Very nice.. Like it,5
Good services and offers discounts...,5
Good service but delivery charges are high,3
We always received wrong items and the taste of food was not good.,2

Very good service food delivered before time period 😃😃,4
"Very bad service,it happened wd me two times,they refused to deliver my order Nd didn't refund my money.i will suggest, don't use this app.",1
Food quality is good and order received on time,4
Easy to order but no discounts occassionally..,3
Zomato is absolutely rubbish i had very bad experiences repeatedly and than I decided to write a review this people are pathetic and ridiculous my food order was completely spilled inside the carry bag and when I contacted them and send the pics these people told me to clean the other containers and and eat the food even animal wouldn't have ate the food after seeing the state of the carry bag........ Zomato you people are crooks,1
Worst app ever .. They had sent me burnt food several times .. Not even refunded and and not even looked into my matter . My money got wasted 2-3 times😡😥,1
The delivery has taken longer time than it mentioned.... I order a chole bhature at 1:00 pm from btw which is at 1 km from my office ... But i hv not recieved my order yet. The service is soo poor,1
They manage watch well in their Zomato world so I had to as far as I have calculated 40 min in Zomato world is around an hour or may be more in real world..... So beware before ordering ..... they have also developed technology to stop time too. May be scientist should seek their help.,1
Bad experience! I did not recieved the order and it's showing order has been delivered.,1
It is a very good app and we can order easily on many cash methods thankyou Zomato,5
I m in love with zomato! Awesome app especically for those who are foodie!,5
Very useful and this app provides lots of offers.,5
Very bad i dont want to give any stars they automatic cancel the order without knowledge of customer and they dont refund the money .,1
Prices are too high but restaurants are available until 1.am and that's better than others like swiggi,3
Zomato is worse in costume support. They first cancel my order and didn't want to return money so asked first 3 days then 5 days and now 8 days. They thought that what will he do if we didn't return money. He is only a costume and they thought who will file complaint against us for only 300₹ and the worse part is they did no my birthday so please don't use this app they are the worse in every aspect,1
Order was cancelled for no reason after an hour of wait.,3
If customer get any order in bad state and he raises any complaint for that it should be better taken care of and for 1st complaint one must not even ask for proof and all that too to a customer who has been using the app frequently.,3
Super app It shows me the best and the prices are very affordable,5
I can't cancel the order. if I want to cancel and placed another order I can't do that so I am giving Zomato 3 stars,3
Really poor service and they are very rude to customers and it's clear cheating of customer's money. Deleted the account today.,1
A family restaurant with consistency in preparation and choice if Menu.,4
Such a bad experience regarding order no one agent is not responding properly,2
Service is good. In this covid-19 situation it helps very much.,4
Zomato wallet option is not anywhere and does not contain help button for any other queries except orders,1
Very nice app and food is very very tasty 😋😋😋😋,5
"Fast service and till now no complaints, keep it up 👍",5
Always said wrong location. Totally bad exprience.,1
"Poor app , delivered wrong item and unable to reach is even a pro user",1
"No customer satisfaction reviews, no customer care numbers, amount once deducted from your account will have no notice. More like a scam.",1
"Nice app , could improve if they had an AI assistant!",4
Helpful and easy to find restaurants,5
"Good app to order more option then competition, Helped lot in cv19 crisis",5
Very bad quality of cheese they use and also use least cheese,1
It is very good app they give you many coupans and delivery so much fast,5
Good service delivery within the given time delivery agent very good n pleasent.,4
Good app. But i have issue finding Zomato pro section. It is not visible anywhere,4
Sometimes resturant is near by but delivery is not available in my location,4
Delivery charges are soo costly 55 rupees for one order I hate it because the restaurant is near but delivery charges are so much 😡😡😡,3
"Their policies are all nonsense, you order something from the menu and the restaurant calls me instead of zomato to cancel the order. There is no way I can call anyone or chat with anyone. The valet says he has no idea. And then I am told I cannot use COD on further orders and will have to pay for something that wasn't even prepared by the restaurant to deliver. Why is something on the app menu if it cannot be packed and delivered? Uninstalled.",3
"I placed some order recently and i have some issue with that item so i started chatting with customer care ,he did'nt give any solution and he just left that conversation,really customer support is bad telling with my experience",1
Tax and delivery charges are escalated when compared to initial days...,2
Zomto is provides the service very keen and timely....so love to order through using zomato app....,5
Zomato is best for food ordering app . But we are want more offers.,5
Third class experience....they do not call back to their customers as only computer reply. I got my order after 1.25 hours and I keep request them to help me,1
Zomato has gone down in terms of service and keeping on promise of delivering quality food. There is no one to help on the Chat window and being a PRO member I feel disgusted. I will never recommend Zomato and never use it in future.,1
Good offers and food options. Less pricer that Swigy. Love Zomato.,5
They're increasing price month by month. Change 30 to 40% more then actual restaurant's.,1
I wish if could less than this. Pathetic system and back hand support team No customer care to assist you in need.,1
Too much extra charges on the MRP of Food.not at all reasonable price.they charge minimum of rs 100 extra over MRP of rs 300.,1
"Very nice...... Good helping staff and fast working person,",5
"Don't buy Zomato pro, many restaurants are rejecting payment through Zomato pro even though they are listed in Zomato pro dining. Better prices and offers compared to swiggy.",3
Zomato allows restaurants to sell food even without proper description and photos..,1
Negative experience using this app every time .. so cluttered UI... and stop stupid advertising on YouTube... swiggy much better than this,1
"After sending a mail also no response from u people what the service ur providing I'm unable to understand swiggy is better than Zomato,even after providing tickets number also no response no proper response even if get bad quality food also should we eat silently I want response immediately for my question",1
Zomato is very smooth over service,5
The delivery charges are very High... All the other things are good,4
Best food delivery aap but some facilities are still missing,5
Timing which ur giving it's very bad not even updating a time waste of time using the app it's better to go and get to restuarant,1
The customer service was really bad and food took 50 minutes for delivery,1
"Poor service, even after opting a free delivery once delayed the kind of excuse your coming up with is unacceptable.",2
The app is crashing whenever i try to open it..... Worst update,1
"Very informative on fingertips, star ratings are very much appreciatable",5
"Zomato has given rating to mousomi restaurant as 4.1 which anyone would rely upon. Though refunded in full amount against a garbage cuisine from Mousomi restaurant, behala, kolkata but Zomato cannot off shoulder it's involvement in such shaddy association without due diligence.",1
food was excellent ..with very quick delivery..,5
Very easy to navigate,5
"Zomato works like an ANNPURNA devi, which fullfil hunger to civilian. It create more employment, rapid growth for food industry.",5
Better discounts and prompt delivery. I have begun to like them now.,4
Sorry my bad. I forgot to delete my old review..I like the new UI..i would want more restaurants to have Pro .,4
Could not able to connect with person and can't do cancle order... Very poor,1
Worst. Can you believe it my delivery guy didn't go to the restaurant to pick up my order? And I have paid already!! To make matter worse u don't have any customer care number where I can call??!!! Just worse app ever. I am going to recommend every body to uninstall this app.,1
Nice full satisfaction by ordering ion this app hope that this app gives much more offer for making first five orders,4
Superb experience on food delivery and speedy services from zomoto app and support,5
Good service from the zamato but the restaurant are not too good they not care about customer not serving food in proper manners.,4
The customer service option is not working. Their phone numbers are not working.,1
Much better than swiggy.. Very good features for easy delivery.,5
I never use any other food app been using Zomato for how long I don't remember best thing is that Zomato provided so much jobs to boys who didn't have a job.,5
Now a days most of the Zomato valets are demanding for tip and ratings. I don't want to point out the names but it'll be better if Zomato gives them advice not to do so. we will give when service was satisfactory,3
"Worst experience ever with zomato ms. Dikhsha, Alok and Tapesh customer care executive worst service provided by them. They don't have value of customers time. They leave the chat in mid of discussion. They don't give any solution to me...19/03 can you provide your email I'd so that I can share the screenshots of the chat of your executives how harras the customers. It will help me.",1
Great tasty pizzas and burgers must try have good offers on pizza buy medium pizza and get Regular pizza free.. Offer valid in Dine In and Take Away Only..,5
Zomato app is quick and user friendly..,4
"Worst app, providing spoiled food and not even an executive is responding and even not responding in email.",1
"Zomato is just a thug. 1. They overcharge the price of food items. 2. They charge taxes over and above the already hiked prices on which tax is already Paid 3. They never deliver the complimentary food items and food quantity is less than originally available at the food place 4. They charge hefty delivery charges over and above all these. 5. After paying delivery charges, they still ask for tips for the delivery person and further donations.",1
When a customer is busy with somewhere work during the time they gave call.. within 3min when we are giving return call they will not get connected.. and simply they wil tell ordered got canceled... when we complain to customer service.. they were telling money is non refundable.. neither they delivary food nor money... just they are stealing money from customers for no reason... can't they wait for 3mintues? Simple they gave call twice and told order got canceled..,1
Rates are high. delivery charges are high,2
suhas has given very good service and he has given options on starters and main course. very active guy who understand customer taste. rate him 5 star.,5
excellent app.. but keep the restaurant details as updated,5
Awesome fast and easy app looking good My favourite all food is here 😋😋😋😋😋😘😘😘,5
Worst part on the delivery is..delivery guy Carries multiple order which lead to delay in delivery and food simply gets cold.. worst delivery service from zomato,1
"very good service , but make food delhivery fast",5
Zomato Pro is the best money saver for food and now also available for delivery. Ask some of your friends to share you the free 3 months pro code so you can have a free trial.,5
Thanks Zomato . An application to Kill your hunger at reasonable prices 😃.,5
Some time in searching product and place it will show other stores,4
But delivery location is too late... but its good with having offers😊,4
Restaurant's place or area name should be display on image itself,1
The new updatw is good and the food deliverwd is also the best and the service is also bestt !!!!,5
Help in every moments and 5 star is for food and Zomato I'm giving 4 star coz of delivery boy they are annoying some times,4
"What kind of assistance Zomato provides? The food is not delivered, the Zomato assisting person is reading the messages bit not replying.",1
Additional star to Zomato if possible....your valet delivers food in storming rain and still remains polite. Wonderful Zomato!,5

Very bad app... Cust chat support is doo bad.. they did not rplying ....very bad food and restaurants all bad,1
Restaurant attached with zomato is not good in quality.,1
Actual rates are much lower than app rates..all discounts are fake not real.,1
Always make some errors after 4 or 5 orders,1
"Zomato is cheating the customers.. They assign multiple orders to their delivery executives. The customer who gave the order first ends up in long wait. That's why all the trouble between customers and their delivery executives, the main culprit is Zomato themselves.",1
"Loved the food.. definitely the best Chinese hub in Bangalore. If u love Chinese food then it is highly recommended that you must try ordering from this place, because they don’t just serve food, they make you fall in love with their food.",5
Greate experience..ecspecially delivery guys timely delivery and behaviour are good,5
The prices are way too high for the food they provide as per the restaurant prices are compared,3
I love cash-on-delivery and I love this app so much delivery boys correct time delivery so all of you install this app please OK,4
Almost 2 hours even no body bother to call and apologise very bad service,1

Paneer do pyaza was tasteless even though I had given instructions that I need spicy. Really disappointing. Manchurian is okay not like a standard restaurant,1
Super fast delivery app it's cool app,5

"Worse app not taking care of restaurant contact no and even instruction is not going the particular gulab restaurant in rohtak ,if someone wants to give instruction how come one can give .",1
Excellent service with Fabulous delivery boys . Good Zomato keep it up 🥳,5
"We are not able to use the promo code even if we are eligible for it, especially if the offer is from zomato. It's just an eyewash.",3
Mostly sometimes they increase the prices like flight using cookies and history,1
still a slot for. improvement but yes more than handy for the requirements of typical indians who are food lovers,4
Very good always in mostly my visited cities where are zomato.,5
This is best In the situation of lockdown and the delivery boys really such a heroes they can risk for our and our family to provide we food 😀😀,5

"Offer wise is good sometimes, sometimes not good .",4
Excellent service Excellent staff selection Reasonable service charge,5
The app was more user friendly and have many developed useful features...more informational than other apps,5
Great app with amazing service. Pretty easy to use,5
It provides more offer than other food delivery app and covers many restaurants,5
The paper bill we received with the order is different from the bill shown on the Zomato app and the amount was also higher.,1
Valets not available frequently....offer coupons can be given more... But still ok,3
Fast delivery amazing offers ! Love the app.,5
Very good offers and support being provided.,5
Delivered wrong food and when. Asked for refund I was Offered a coupon code where in I asked them to take back the good back aswell. And upon requesting a call back so many times it was done,1
"The best app ever! I have stopped cooking my meals, I am so dependent on it. I have gained more weight too. The late night cravings, the prices also are so good. Since I do overtime at my previous job I've been using my savings now but anything for such great food.",5
chat support is to bad no responde wait from 10 mints i found hair in my food give compliante but no one responding use first time its really bad expirence,1
"Better than Swiggy in many ways. At least you guys are honest in your billing and deals unlike swiggy who are thieves. Had the coverage of Kolkata restaurants been better, i would have given 5 Star.",4
Support staff is not up to the mark. Taking longer to respond on issues.,1
This is really sarcastic I ordered a food from subway near to my place which was to be delivered by 8.40pm approximately it was not delivered n I received a call by 8.37 pm and I said will be there by two minutes and by the time I went to collect it showed me the food has already been delivered I don't know whom did they delivered the food which I ordered as it was already paid. When I contacted the customer chat they blindly say it was accidentally selected as delivered food,1
Zomota has good service but it's app location tracker is waste. Will Highly suggest to update it.,3
Worst experience ever .......The food quality delivered not good .....after complaining it many times their is no upgradation in quality check of food and hygiene....,1
Always delay in delivery and so many time they change delivery timing,1
"What can I say this app supports team first they don't have any manners talk to customer. I want to tell you today incident with my order, first riders talk to me rudely , then I ask help from support team did not listen, if anyone want to know about more I can share you all the call recording and screenshot talk between me , support & rider. I did not had lunch due that I am not able to focus on work . This kind of service provided by biggest food delivery chain of India 🙏",1
Zomato chat is not opening properly,2
Very good and in time delivery,4
Such a worst app.60₹ ki cheez ke 150+ or fir maine pro membership bhi li or delivery charge dena hi pad rha. Bhai sharam karo..!! Like seriously you are charging delivery charge on a pro account and a tip too? After taking Zomato pro membership I feel like a fool coz I am getting no benefits. Disgusting service. It's really amazing how you are fooling peoples. Bhai nhi deni mujhe tip or tum zabardasti le rhe ho? Thank you I will never use your poor app.,1
Poor delivery....no food....planned the order at 6pm..it's 6:46pm the food has not even left the restaurant. Time shows 13 minutes for the last 20 minutes. You don't even deserve 1 star...... Since then zomato executive Rohit called me and was very apologetic and dealt with the matter in such a commendable way that all my bitterness was gone. I also realised that an honest approach can win hearts. Great job Rohit.....👍👍👍👍 i have restored my review to 5*,5
after update when ever i am opening the app its showing something error...please try again after some time,2
Horrible experience i ordered something abd get something else and on enquiring they keep asking for image which unfortunately u didnt have absolutely no sense of responsibility and accountability,1
The Chocolate Room in Rajahmundry was not accepting any online orders even though it was open. I want it to be accepting orders online or consider removing from Zomato catalogue,4
delivery guy was not wearing mask even he wasn't in proper dress of an delivery boy. and delivery was late .,1
"super late deliveries, inflated price, bad experiences..",1
"So far so good, even though placed few orders only, all well & good!!!",5
the foos is never delivered the same . it has happeened with me for the 4th time...I cannot trust it now .....,1
"To be frank your app deserves total rating of only 1 star.Even for 10 min distance walk you guys are charging around 100 rupees,this is not good thing it's better to not install again this app",1
Very disappointing service after 01 hrs of order replacement I come to know that my order is cancelled,1
Great effort to deliver item on time,5
good service and timely service.,4
Takes long time to delivery the food and its has been more than 1hr waiting still we didn't receive our order,1
Worst app... if we apply wrongly.. within a minute we cancelled the order also we are not getting money... worst app ever,2
Delicious food with variety of cocktails Padmalochan was very helpful in choosing our food & cocktail,5
Very high payment to compare other delivery apps.. I don't like this way,5
High delivery charges and No Fast Delivery... worth service,1
Too much delivery charge. Pro accounts should be given free delivery,4
Item was missing .....and they didn't concerned to contact me after complaining also,1
"Very good app for food delivery, love it 🥰",5
The best deleivery app. Easy to use. No ads,5
"Bad service, order delayed multiple instances.",1
Service is improved a bit.,3
"Worse app, offer can't be applied, fail to manage raustaurant partners.",1
Authentic pan asian food! The crystal dimsums were melt in the mouth. Great taste!,5
Not verified ordered item description and missing side dishes,2
Fully satisfied with the service 😍😍😍,5
Fast and easy service..very comfortable😊,5
Fast delivery and good food,4
Fast delivery and good,5
Good and much more convenient,5
All good restaurants are available. But Zomato pro members should get free home delivery atleast.,3
"I went to restaurant after found in app it was zomato pro customer. Restaurant claim zomato pro closed. When raise to zomato help line, after half an hour they reply restaurant is not our customer. When I check again in app it's remove. Finally zomato helpline suggest me call restaurant before to go and don't rely on Zomato app. It's realy poor service.",1
Great stuff as well as delivery services,5
I am very happy to order at zomato because their late facility is very good.,5
Never helps customer when there is a concern about food thats been order. Worst app to order any food.,1
"I had been using Zomato app since last 4 years & I am quite satisfied with your services. I would had given you 5 stars rating but I won't, due to recent zomato delivery boy incident, you have suspended Kamaraj. He is I believe an honest man who was only doing his job. If you don't bring him back to the job & also compensate for his losses I will not order anythung from your app till the time. Yours' sincerely a Loyal customer.",3
Worst food delivery app ..they always deliver late ... And the customer care executive they hired are more than ridiculous.... No worth,1
Very helpful and sefty delivery,5
"Worsttttt app eveeer.. they took my money and still didn't return it, and still asking me to send emails and wait.. no authenticity.. ppl don't use this app eveeerrrr",1
"Very worst service.... Two times I'm not recieved my ordered food, delivery agent switched off his phone..",1
I have experienced a couple of times that your valets don't pick up food fromthe restaurant and on asking they say they never received the order,3
Zomato is light years ahead when it comes to price and service compared to useless Swiggy.,5
It has nearby hotels to our convinence and fast delivery .it's very important to us in the time of hungry and also for aged people's.,5
Easy to access and best services,5
Really great taste and quality food. Highly recommended,4
Best Food delivery app. all time good offers provider keep it up zomato team 😋😇😇👍👍👍👍👍,5
Food delivery was right on time. The delivery man was wearing a mask. He is polite.,5
Very good. Covers a large variety.,4
A very fraudulent company with a shady deal with ovenstory. They promise free garlic bread offer on zomato and then later cancel it from your order upon payment stating its only for orders from ovenstory app & website. Neither companies bother to acknowledge their mistake or make mends. The same offer is still available in chennai as of this time of post. Very poor service. I hope this makes helps people more cautious going forward ordering food on either apps.,1
Took 1 hr 40 mins for order.. And honey chilly potato was all messsed..... Pathetic service......,1
Good app.... Food gets delivered very fast.....,5
superbb app for hungry those who want to eat delicious and 😋😋yummy..it brings all kinds of food at door step. Thank you Zomato for such a tasty app👌👍,4
Fast delivery and especially tirunelveli city very good delivery man & hotels,4
They are charging much higher price then the restaurant menu... Not worth at all even after being the pro member...,1
They list any xyz restaurant on there platform ... Don't care about quality and customer service... If you care about your health then don't use there service to order online because 80% restaurant listed on zomato are so unhygienic and poor quality,1
Complaint page not open . Always show error,1
Rates are higher then actual rates of outlet or restaurant on ZOMATO whereas they are charging delivery n packing charging also,1
Can't open the new version or errer fix the issues,1
Pathetic now a days.. giving orders not getting on time.. food below mark quality..and thr is no response evn aftr complaint.,1
Very smooth hassle free transcation and delivery.. 5+ Very happy,5
So disappointing it took 1 hour and half to deliver an order.,2
I wish I could provide 0 stars. No customer service to even contact.,1
Delivery charge is too high when compared with peers,3
Excellent app We r suddenly stuck in hospital. And we ordered a food on zomato..they dilivered the food.,5
Tasty restaurants and good service...... and also maintains safety precautions in cooking food and delivering....Tq so much zomato,5
Zomatto pro is worth taking to all foodie lovers..Excellent offers at your finger tips and fsster delivery to home. Great n enjoying.,5
The issue was sorted out. Good customer care by zomato.,4
Worst Customer Support System! Unresponsive! Slow! No proper resolutions!!,1
Its always good that accepts bad feedback and change things to good . First i have given 1 star rating . Now i have changed to 5 star rating.,5
Very bad experience with rider.he deliver food after 2 hours.give proper training to u r rider before sending them for delivery.. Very disappointed,1
Zomato claim one time free on not arrival by time...but upon asking for that they said technical reasons etc and didnt follow whatever they promised...so fake instructions,3
Awesome app and best delivery,5
Fast delivery and easy to order...,5
Not taking any care of customer interests. Don't initiate refund for the missing items.,1
If a particular dish is not available at particular restaurant then why that dish is being shown on zomato app,4
Excellent fast and safe delivery,5
A variety of options available to choose from backed by excellent customer support.,5
Loved the tandoori momos and paneer tikka!! The green chutney is super spicy and yummy 😍 brownie is also a must try,5
Food was delicious....& service also excellent thank you 😊😍,5
Really good work by the support team. Immediately support received by them. Keep it up guys.👏👏,5
Excellent app.... Ghar baithe hi mazze se order kro or have fun of different food items....!!!,5
Zomato is charging extra on MRP and delivery charges are high .,1
After giving spoiled food they are not returning my money very useless app and the customer care service is the most worst part they will not respond to your problems,1
Honest! If your order is cancelled. Your money is immediately returned. Good people here! No need to fight for a refund. They just give it to you.,4
Useless app..I ordered food 2 hrs back...no response from executive or restaurant,1
Easy to use.. just regulate the taste.. not same every time,4
Exceptionally good and safe service.,5
"Very nice, eventually I will make it a habit to order via this app",5
Pathetic service not reply to my messages make me to wait for over 20mins and not reply in the end.,1
"While search biryanizaade ,there is no vallet everytime that is why I want to choose pick up option,😂",3
ordered first time from zomato......and after 2 hours got message order delivered but actually didn't receive my order. very very bad services,1
Site very laggy. Map not loading.,4
"First they ask u ur feedback, when u complain, they will just keep asking u random question and ultimately do nothing.",1
Liked payment mode in ZOMATO... In Swiggy it takes time at payment...,4
Food is good bt delivery came late and even take high delivery fees,4
My order was delivered with open pack. And when asked for refund. They have created only half amount. I didn't expected from ZOMATO,1
"After being zomato pro member their offers are very limited, they are even charging delivery fee and most of the offers are applicable if we order minimum of 400.",1
Order not delivered after one and half hour and they keep asking you to wait. Pathetic service,1
Horrible service.waited for 1hr 30 mins for my order.will never use this app,1
Delivery is fast and food is also good,5
"Zomato has not deliver my order on right time and cancelled my order, my family waited and remain hungry. Zomoto delivery person talked with us very bad and also customer care has not help very well.. I am not happy with Zomato.",1
YOUR DISCOUNTS DO NOT APPLY ON COMBO ITEMS. FOUND OUT THE HARD WAY. DO NOT BUY PRO!,1
Excellent and hygienic delivery and polite behaviour of delivery valet,5
One of the top service company in hospitality n delivery specially customer care resolve problems in a minute and make their customers happy.. thanks Zomato love u..,5
"Delivery rates are too high, pro membership is worst and waste of money...... Now start hating to use this application.",1
Worst resturents associated with Zomato. Very bad experiance. They just take prepaid orders and then doesn't deliver on time. Ever Zomato doesn't help in it.,1
Worst! I orderd as I was in hospital since from morning. After waiting for 40 min zomato vallet said he haven't received any order from their network. And zomato chat is giving me the number of vallet and asking me to come ordinate with him. I called vallet and told him the issue he asked me the hotel and assured me that he will go there personally and cheak.,1
"fresh food, shawarma and BBQ was mind blowing. must try here😋",4
Way bettee than any other food ordering app.,5
"Very poor service, food delivered to me after long time ,after taking delivery from restaurant",1
They are committing a fraud. They charge us something and the physical invoice with the food is of some other amount. This is a scam.,1
Very poor delivery..if you want your food not fresh then choose Zomato..,1
Swiggy is better than zomato. Zomato customer care service is very poor. They reply us 4 days after issue. I lost my money without getting food.,1
"Best app forever , thanks to Zomato make me happy every time.",5
Got amazing 25% off on restraint bill that too without capping amazing extraordinary,5
There is no option for cancellation of order... Could kindly suggest to provide cancellation option for customers..,2
Such an useful app and exiting offers etc.,5
"When you raise an issue regarding quality of the food, response is not satisfactory",2
Good service and on time delivery,5
IT is one of the best food app. just download it & enjoy best offers.,4
Zometo is worst fraud app as they charge higher price for same item if you visit the store their prices are less and over that charging higher deliver charge . Just showing they are giving discount .but in reality you are paying higher price for same product excluding delivery charge.,1
"Good, affordable and easy accessing",5
After placing the order it was delivered after 1 hour 35 mins.,1
"Poor delivery system its take too much time in delivery, delivery man not wear uniform",1
Very nice & taking all precautions & fast delivery,5
Always on time and deliver fresh.,5
Best app for order online food from home . I order many food from this app. But prices are bit high,4
Delivery charges are extra.. but otherwise satisfactory ...,5
Unable to chat with executive there is no option to us for revert,1
Very fast delivery and very 🙂,5
Some of the restaurents are not delivering a quality food ....pls look into it...because u r not giving any solution....,1
"Cost of foods are more than MRP of the shop, being PRO customer no offer on best taste place, but at sh*tty places.",3
Customer care service is very nice.. immediately respond to all your complaints,5
Good but sometimes promo codes not valid.. overall nice,5
Wrost Customer service. I have rated this 1 year before still they have same issue.,1
"When food ordered and delivered wrong, Restaurant nos are wrong and your app says something went wrong and does not support so if we order vegetarian food you may deliever non-veg food which means we pay for food which we can't eat and we stay hungry.",1
Services are good..m always happy with zomato...,5
"They do not care about food... Order was delayed because the delivery boy had to pick up another order.. my food was not hot... Comprared to swiggy, bad service",1
Too good Service as well as fast delivery,5

Very good service and an time food delivery tnku zomato☺,5
Overall service Good Food quality and quantity is good,5

Timely delivery and neat packing. Thanks,5
"Thanks to zomato for keeping be bhuka for entire night. Places order, after two hours they cancelled my order leaving no further option. Do contInue good service",1
Zomato has no control on orders placed to Domino's. Domino's didn't deliver order and cancelled it without refunding money but Zomato showed it delivered. No trace of money and order on Zomato. Pathetic experience for a PRO customer.,1
Zomato is doing well now a days both in service and support.,5
It's very good that each time you order you get discounts,5
Riders never carry change or balance for COD orders so we have to let them have the rest of the money. They say they are not informed of the payment method until they reach the customer's place.,2
Food carried not properly & all the dishes mixed with each other... I am not satisfied,1
Delivery time and rider quality has been deteriorated,1
Good and very safety service. Perfect time discipline. Good. Keep it up. 👍👍,5
Amazing app ni words superb lovely and the taste was yummmmmmmm....❤👍,5
Tracking info should be available separately..,5
Doing nice but also set delivery method in which we can also pay on delivery above 750 rupees,4
Food price is so high that a lower middle class person cant order.,2
"Worse experience ever, taking my money and canceling the order with no consideration to the customer and not providing any resolution to the issue",1
I have cancelled my subscription yet you continue charging me for membership in my credit card...Please reverse my December charge. Thank you.,1
"Good service, food also is good",5
"What's going on with the application? ""Something went wrong. Please try again""",4
Service man dilivered Pizza is not in its shape. All mixed. Also not too warm to eat. Almost very bad service. Same on you.,1
Very good 🙂😊🙂 app and service fast delivery,5
I m download Zomato Recently when I was order something its say it was not open. This area we r not able to deliver.,1
I got bug in food... But they are not suppoting even after sending them photo. Worst experience.,1
"Issue with delivery boy.......... other girl by the same name has also ordered from restaurant .by the time we reached there for order some other has took the order. So we called the delivery agent for the delivery , he answered in roude way by talking about other things other than order. He is telling all other rubbish. Very bad....... no concern about order. He is also recording the calls",1
Very much useful and convenient for for every hungry person.,4
"The rates are much higher in the app than the actual restaurant rates + taxes + delivery charges. In total, of you're ready to pay 2.5 times the actual price of the dish, please use this app. Also, the service sucks many a times, they don't acknowledge dissatisfactions faced by you.",1
User friendly interface ...and good promotion codes,5
Poor services for verka express . Orders deliver very late.,1
Didnot have minimum customer support and not have problem resolving fastly,1
M so happy with zomato the late delivery payment method is Just awesome 👌,5
Delivery charges are high..nd limited restaurants..,4
Sometimes they provide food from local roadside vendors even if you have ordered from standard restaurant,1
Worst experience ever. After spending 1200₹ and mentioning not to make spicy food. They cannot resolve the issue. Offered to refund 100₹ . Most pathetic service,1
Very disappointing towards customer service and delivering incorrect deliveries. No one is responding 👎👎👎,1
Very fast delivery I loved this app😍😍,5
Perfect service and very convenient,5
"Easy, Faster and Variety of restaurant",5
"One of the worst service, payment cut after that order cancel from hotel, executive came all the time late, and don't know location, I m feeling tired up with zomato",1
More options and flexible offers.. need patience to check out all the options.,4
It is charging more than the cost at restaurant and also delivery charge is increased and 30% tax also have to be paid Completely looting people,1
Recently I am facing the problem of payment. I dont understand why do they not accepting COD method for payment. I am facing too problem.,2
Worst app not able to load it due to some technical issues,1
Good simple to use app and very good service.,5
I really love zomato its very helpful & easy to order,5
No point of giving discounts because the taxes makes it all equal I got 80 Rs. off and taxes are 40 - 80 Rs. What's the point of giving discount than ??,3
Nice and a very good app. Everyone are kind and polite .. Thanks to zomato 😊,5
happy service and food quality.,5
"Worst experience.... Delivery guy has given multiple orders to deliver, even after paying for delivery charges... Very pathetic service...",1
"Poor, sad, worst, pathetic, unprofessional, uneducated, ridiculous customer support. This platform used to be good but now they have become the worst online ordering platform.",1
"Awesome food, great delivery partner services",5
"Hi Team, Today I ordered from a restaurant. Out of 3 Items I received only one. I didn't get proper response from the Customer Support Team. This leads to bad customer Experience",1
Please add more restaurant .. Some of them are not even functional,2
Very quick delivery. I received Domino's Pizza in 17 minutes. Thanks.👍,5
Chicken fry is in worst condition Its too dry and not look like fresh,1
"Worst customer care assistance and app You are order item A, they will deliver item B, and say we are sorry, we wont repeat it next time and not all time you will get your money back Worst app, its wasting money and time Its repeating again & again",1
Very quick service polite representative,5
Never be on time..infact I wanted to rate Zomato as ZERO. Strongly unrecomended. Wastage of money and time ....,1
To add this type of restaurant. Savl's home food.,1
I have problem with order but order support is not working..,1
"didnt get the discount which we usually get on buying 2 medium pizza from pizza hut, no other discount provided",3
"Worst app, they are cheater they give spilled food and rotten food and then they will not talk back to you even on prepaid order.",1
"now a days Zomato was getting worst, no response properly, no good food, no good package... all are getting worst and worst..",1
Excellent for lock downs and very good service,5
It's ok . They charge 3 type fees and deduct from.zomato membership pro discount.,2
Clunky app. Doesn't track food delivery.,1
Pathetic service....took one to deliver a pizza wherein the restaurant is just 15 mins away from the location,1
I like how user friendly it is. My mom uses it so easily.,3
"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ experience after many years of use, from Bangalore to small town in Bengal! The experience has become better and better...",5
Nice app.....good discount on food and delivery,3
"As happy as I am about the godspeed express delivery,I am a lil' bit concerned about the tax u guys are demanding,so,it would so nice of u guys..if u could go easy on the taxes..by lowering the tax amount to a bare minimum...so that we people can afford it..if u know what i mean",5
"It has the worst customer service,these guys don't even provide a way so u can talk to the customer service and don't even refund .I hope this company falls in ruins.",1
very bad service from team of zomato cuz there is no customer support executive for report any issue only boat whos giving answers. it is too much for me and a badluck too that i am a zomato gold member.,1
I am decrease 5 star to 1 star for policy of missing food item in particular order,1
1 hour before have placed the order its still not arrived.... called the delivery boy says will take more 20 mins???? Have ordered for evening snacks not dinner 👎,1
Awesome app Delivery is good Recommended to all,5
"Be very careful with your order. If you did not receive it and yet received a message that the food has been delivered, immediately launch a report. The food has been delivered wrongly to other address and Zomato is powerless to rectify the issue. They will tell you that it has been sent to the right location as the delivery driver told them so. All they could do is refund a small fraction of the cost of the product. Sometime, they give discount code and the refund dissappear. Deliveroo better!",1
It's a very good app . That specially giving offers too.... Nice service,4
Only interested in making money but you have to check quality and the taste. I normally order frm the best reviews. But it seems they fail to deliver good food. I want honest reviews the second think the restaurants in India specially have chalta hai attitude. Honestly want to cook my own food instead of paying high and not getting taste.,3
"Pathetic experience with Zomato support team, wasted 600 bucks on horrible food and inreturn gesture of 100 voucher and valid till 30 days, this means to get benefit of 100 fall again in to Zomato trap",1
I love this app good service good timing delivery 👏,5
Not feeling like cooking is soo easy ..bcz of Zomato..thank u,5
Discount not happy & other charges is to much,1
"Zomato made food delivery easy, good food at our doorstep by using ome app...",5
worst food delivery app.. order get cancel automatically and they charged cancelltaion fee to me.,4
"Awesome app, should a probably include better animations",5
Very bad customer service... Late for response... Both the customer service and food service....,1
Good implementation of the App. No quirks so far.,5
Today my sister ordered a veg biriyani from moti mahal and we found there a bigger piece of broken glass in the middle part of the biriyani. So all of biriyani lover's kindly check your biriyani distinctly before you eat. So how you rated the moti mahal and zomato online food service is convenient to us..... Think about it before you place an order.....,1
Excellent and Dedicated Service which is committed to deliver,5
"Received incomplete order , no response from customer team even after multiple followups . Never gonna use this app again..",1
waste.... Service delivery take parcel after starting eating and waste of booking poor 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕,1
Worst experience. They don't provide refund if the food is tasteless. I had a really bad experience with Zomato so I'll ask you please don't trust this app.,1
"I could have given 5 stars because this app deserves it !! Recent incident which was happend to one of your delivery person was literally injustice. I am not going to download this app unless you give job to that person. If someone is rich it doesn't mean they can take advantage on poor !!! For your company growth you could listen whatever customers says even if they are wrong, Imagine what if all the delivery people stop working for your company can that customer able to deliver it !?",1
Waste app... Not delivered but received delivery message... Bloody app................................😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡,1
Very bad .the order is never on time,1
Excellent Service and offers that was only given by ZOMATO and no one else can Compete with it.Keep it up 👍,5
Hey! Don't get me wrong its a good app and deserves 5 stars but I am unimpressed with the cash on delivery option its limit is 500 ruppees only I really beg u pls pls pls increase it to 1000 pls rest everything's awsm,4
Very fast service and too easy in use,5
Super fast delivery but requested plz increse food quality nd quantity,5
"I really appreciate the new user friendly features in zomato, especially post covid",5
It's an awesome app.. saving ur valuable time when u dont wana go out 🥰. Thanks zomato,4
My ratings to the restaurant got vanished and it is frustrating,1
Excellent offers and all options available,5
Why does the app does'nt shows any restraunts some times...even one???,4
Now offers are only coming on that card which I don't have wow.Seriously from which date I buy ZOMATO pro I feel that's really good but now new promo codes are not coming so I am paying extra for every damn order which I ask for delivery. SO it's better next time I go myself and buy.,2
Very responsive and trustworthy customer care.,5
Most of the restaurant numbers are invalid....,1
Very easy and handle smoothly.,5
good experience with the zomato...rider with professional attitude...and the order is in best quality..best thing of zomato.,5
good delivery... and offers are too good...,5
Superb service and all guys behaviour is good and polite,4
"All is well until they mess up your order. Zomato driver literally hands me my food all spilled inside the bag, and Zomato says ""it wasn't done with intention, so we won't replace or refund, but here is a 10 dirham coupon."" Literally disgusting customer service.",1
Fast delivery and good service,5
Osm geting a satisfying services and food.. Great work dude..,5
Absolutely disgusting and disappointing service including delivery time.,1
"The customer care sucks big time. The associate who was supposed to help me, just vanished. The weird thing I aahe is from escalation desk. Zomato has lost control over food quality, quantity and services from the restaurant, big brands like pizza hut also delivers whatvthay have in stock and notbwhat we have ordered for. Few other brands have no idea about cooking but just chilli powder. Ironically, if it's a dine-in in the same restaurants, they serve well.",2
Worst app ever. Not even a single order delivered on time. If I could give a negative 5 star I would,1
"I really hate this Zomato, taxes and all 50 over top of bill. Same food and same restaurant, I see difference amount of close to 100. Do you know one more thing, this is al despite of having my membership account. Such a nonsense app which makes ppl fool.",1
Zomato charges high delivery charges and plus taxes . Should minimize it,2
It's not showing any promo codes whenever retry the order ...,1
So good and order to easy,5
Tracking map is not at all working.,1
Miserable experience. Every time order gets canceled after 1 hrs of order at night. Shoot bad,1
Most unreliable app! Delivery gets cancelled all the times,1
"Completely disgusted.....ordered ice cream from nirulas and got the wrong order...connected with thier "" intelligent"" chat...which very intelligently!! Hasn't responded since the past 20 minutes....and now nirulas is shut so they don't need to bother....no customer service...no other way to contact them....act like they r the best when they don't even know how to handle customers coz they don't want to....they only care about their commissions!!!....and this isn't the first time...",1
All the service is great.,4
It's not sending the verification code ... What is the problem ?.... I tried many times but no response...,2
"Zomato is the worst thing that can happen to food Industry in India. It's a shame such companies thrive. They discriminate customer based on number of orders they have made. They do not allot valet for orders of new customer. I always have to wait at least 30 minutes for the valet to be allocated for my order whereas when my friend orders, a valet is allocated almost immediately. Plus I didn't get refund for my order, it's been 8 days they're ignoring my chats completely. I'm gonna sue them.",1
"Do not order from Zomato,they cheat customers, Ones I ordered some food, it got cancelled then I contacted delivery person he said your order got cancelled from Zomato end ,then I contacted to customer support team, there was no proper response, hence I lost my food and money too .",1
Very nice and fast delivery,5
Excellent Good service n hygienic packaged condition Nothing more to say,5
Can do really better.. Specially on packing and delivery,4
User friendly....easy to follow... amazing good.,5
Delivery on time and nature friendly behaviour,5
A little slow and otherwise perfect,4
Order is not getting delivered timely. Zomato is not responding. Same expirience today after so much apologies Zomato executive offered yesterday.,1
Very nice and fast delivery,5
Very Bed experience not able to contact restaurant as number is with someone else and no one in restaurant to talk and also riders number is not in service....,1
Happy with the delivery and good offers.,5
Recently zomato has improved a lot in terms of customer experience!,1
Very good app to order your food online with maximum offers .,5
The company has grown out of proportion and employees are too casual. A good competitor in future will throw them out. The organisation's true picture comes out when you face some problems and the way the staff treats you. Customer service is pathetic. It's not easy to reach these people.,1
Very good delivery and food quantity also superb,4
Best Dinner nd breakfast very fast service cool,5
It's been an year zomato is not able to maintain their food quatliy and they are not able to contact the restaurants. I suggest to swith zomato or dont even try zomato coz they dont have good cc staff.,1
But every time I order something is missing I don't know why But because of its good support I am giving it a 4star,4
Very nice and fast delivery,5
Zomato delivery is life and time saver,4
They don't pick the call once the order is placed.,1
Horrible..whenever I've ordered from my current address it showed wrong location and delivery executive harassed me,1
Fast delivery good to use,5
It was helped me a lot when I feel hungry,5
"what a waste. You say you give offers and I see the banner on the top just when the app is opened. I select a restaurant and add items and there's the trick you played. No promo code is applicable. No offers available. Or Offer for selected users. What does that mean ""selected users"".? !! Why don't you select me?!? It's just irritating I go look for an offer curiously when I heard there's an offer from people around and then there's problem with my orders.! U kidding?!?",1
Very Very Slow app. Hangs all the time.,1
it's my first order..i got delivered quickly...soo that i filled my tummy full at correct time n a food is hot n delicious...thank you zomato...,5
No order very worst fraudulent order not received but. Coimbatore. Veetu samayal restaurant. Order delivered but not received . Waste of money .,1
"Good and nice, but it takes more time to load the app.",4
One time I choose online payment method and my order not reach in my place and my payment done already but still Zomato not refund my money,1
"Should reduce delivery fee, prices are high then actual rates in restaurant",2
Had great delivery with in time bound,5
realy good...but food rates are high compare to hotel price,5
"Worst experience, speacially ordering pizza with dominos through zomato, this is the second time I have recived uncooked pizza, sorry to say but felt really ashamed in front of our guest, had to throw the entire order, I would not even give 1 star ⭐ as you guys don't deserve it.",1
I order my food with instructions but they will not follow that instructions any more .if we ask they will say sorry for the inconvenience.without following instructions what will you serve the people .,1
As a other Nationalist i faced food problem because all the restaurant in chennai don’t have menu card or if have don’t have picture of food that's why i can't eat well when install zomato it change my view now i can see about food picture and what it contain.And their delivery also good.Thanks zomato.,5
Good and gives food at every where,5
"A convenience , cooked food aggregator app Clearly does its business, nothing less nothing more.",5
Ease to use and delivery estimation time great.,4
"Nice App, Great experience always. All the best zomato team.",5
App is not working. Error while ordering.,1
"It's my birthday today so I ordered pizza from Chicago Pizza using Zomato. When I got these pizzas, they were poor in quality and there was no cheeze, toppings were raw, I paid 1384/- Rupees for that and I was very disapointed with that order, however, when I told this to zomato, they tried to contact the restaurant but did not get any response from them so they have refunded the full amount, I am so happy with this resolution.",5
Zomato has pure quality operations... 1000 times better than substandard low grade Swiggy.,5
Already zomato costing 10 to 20 rs on every plate. Again they are costing extra charges for delivery. It's not fare.,1
Yesterday I ordered waffles. The delivery guy took way longer time after which spoke to me asked me to cancel as it's going to take more time. And said I will get full refund of Rs 604 to my account. Which I haven't got yet and there be is no to talk to about this blunder. I have not received my order and you guys are charging me 604 for what. Is this why we order from you guys to get looted ?? I wAnt someone to call me and refund the entire amount before this goes on social media.,1
This is a waiste service i never seen in my life.....my self phani i order an biryani but un fortunately i kept wrong address but paid in online transaction i contact with delivery person he said that cancel the order u will get the refunded money then i cancel it but i didnt get any money they taken total money under the delivery charges be like........plz a take serious issue on this.....,1
Awesome experience. Time saver application.,5
"Always more than an hour late, customer service doesn't care..",1
I have just ordered a pizza and it is taking so long need improvement for 5 star,3
Easy and good to use..,4
Very quick delivery and easy to operate 😀,4
This is the best app for online food delivery,5
"Discounts are for namesake ,u end up paying more than the actual price of the dish u order",1
This is the best app ever I have seen and used and it is very easy and fast,5
Nice app and quick delivery,5
I ordered the food .and after 1.5 hours they let me know that food can't be delivered as delivery boy has some emergency and they did not either assign any other delivery personnel and went ahead to cancel my order ..pathetic .dong order from swiggy,1
Very late orders and maximum time food are very bad its like old food not fresh,1
"Very Poor service, my promo code id invalid before due date & custumer care service not Avalable..",1
Must visit place for the lovely ambience and simply delicious serves. Perfect date night or friends night out kinda place.,4
Very nice and fast delivery,5
Good Fast and easy.,5
Very good tracking of food,5
Will give 5 stars if you mention food photos beside menu list,4
outstanding and more approachable,4
Good app But delivery charge must be removed,5
Very nice fast delivery and tasty foods😍😍😍😍😍,5
"Food was delivered after 1 hr of pick up from restaurant. Food got soggy by that time, zomato only worries abt their own profit - doesnt matter customer loss to them.",1
This App asked me to pay more for the pro and there's no difference with the regular one... My money is completely wasted.. Swiggy is better,1
App is good but some times app map is not working properly,5
I am very much angry with this app because 1st they are saying 10%off on my order but when i placed order then they are saying that you have to place more orders of worth 500 rupees to get this offer and I have ordered shahi paneer full plate and they have taken full plate price and i recieved only half plate.You all make fools to us 😡😡😡😡😡😡,1
Great discount and fast delivery,5
enjoying the food....!!!$great discounts on this app ..---- however pls ensure that pro user must get better discounts and offers...,5
Very good options and filters. Nice experience,5
Order received in 25mins... better experienced first time. Thank u zomato,5
I want one option in zomato to give gift cards. That is not easily available on the app. Except that every thing is good,4
"Good as per the offers, still need to improve their customer service.",1
Good service and fast delivery,5
"Good , variety of restaurants , offers given",4
"Fast service, nice service",4
Thank you so much for making it easier to order for our loved ones from a long distance. It helped me a lot . Thank a lot for your service ☺️.,5
Nice experience. Payment done immediatly.,4
They are doing multiple delivery with the zomato pro members then what is the benefits for paying additional money's in the name of Pro. There is no priority delivery or fast delivery this happens always,1
"1. Agent do not listen or understand the issue with the order. 2. Offer are not that good, i can get the same food from the same place is different price. 3. No get back to us for any resolution. Just get so upset with ZOMATO feels like totally waste of money.",2
UI easy. Easy to order.,5
Super app....helping nd servicing us alot 👏👏👏,5
Exceptionally Good. Charges are high,3
Pathetic experience i am waiting 1 hour for my order. Still not delivered the order. Please dont order on this app.,1
Good app for Ordering food with punctuality.,5
"Zomato will die soon. Just a filthy startup for valuation. I ordered an item with complete address, the delivery boy dint come and was trying to call me, but the order was already paid so zomato cancelled by its own. On checking with customer care, they said delivery boy called u but it was incomplete address so zomato cancelled and delivery boy not even returned food back to resturant. Next order i placed for COD wid same address and delivery boy reached with no call.",1
"App not working properly , When you want to order getting try again later",1
Please Improve the Map System as everytime Zomato Valet went to another location,3
Good service and get many offers,5
Nice experience and speedy delivery,5
fresh food and food quality is very good .,5
I am not at all happy with the service of zomato this happened two weeks before but I am still angry my father and mother were not at home so and my father gave me money for buying food and I thought to buy it on zomato and ordered two chicken rice and the delivery man's name is karthikayen he took my order to another person who started eating it and gave me two bread toasts and a juice that I don't like and asked sorry at first butwhile his order his 150 ruppes he told to me that I shouldpay250,1
Very nice app but first I think swiggy. Was better but then I realized then zomato is better,5
Very poor service..always delivibg food cold ..I would say use swigy instead of xomota,1
"Delivered In Time , Good Taste Fresh , packing is well",5
Zero rating. Your app says food has arrived and Zomato driver Gurpreet Singh is 3kms away and searching for location even after sending him live lication. Still awaiting food !!!!!!,1
"Zomato has tied up with some worst quality restaurants like Doughnut house, wasting the money of its customers. The quality of this restaurant's doughnuts is very poor. Plus some restaurants do not follow the customer's instructions and the customer support executives defend those restaurants and other support executives who do not resolve customer complaints + irritate the customers with just false assurance. Do not ask me to write to you. Call me after 5 pm on weekdays and resolve issues",1
"Worst experience, If food items are not available it should not be displayed. If you order a cake and made online payment then because it is out of stock order. The order got canceled. The refund will be sent within 5-7 working days. Zomato replies it's not there lookout. Fair enough but if something is not available there is no need display it. Before confirming the order availability check has to be done. If someone wants to place another order using same amount should that person wait?",1
Good service.. very short time delivery,5
"I think zamoto should be Available in R.S pura, jammu. Areas there will be a great sope for zamoto to earn more profit.. !!",2
Great app. keep it up. Kindly re add Rs. 20 tip for the wallet.,4
Over all good. Some offers are not easily understandable,5
Very bad offers and service even after having zomato pro. Disappointed every time i use this app.,1
Great application for enjoying food at home.,5
Order delivered before time..thank u delivery boy..food was as gud as always..👍😊,5
Very good quality and highly discount,5
Amazing experience with Zomato..It has made life easy..,5
Customer care is clueless almost everytime...zomato has to improve a lot on that.,3
"Doing fraud for rate of chapati , hotel rate 12/ piece, Zomato taken 15 rupees, with small size approx 20-30 gram , order 700 rup main course and got fraud quantity cost less than hundred rup.",1
"So much taxes and delevery charges, earlier its was reasonable but now its rocketing",1
Safety and tamperproof delivery measures makes it trustworthy.,5
It seems that have enrolled most of the street vendors and labeled them as restaurants. Always worst quality food,1
Zomato's new delivery system sucks. You don't receive order atleast for 2 hours,1
nice service with very reasonable price in whole Chandigarh,5
"Zomato I am your Member for the last 1 years. I see your delivery boys every weekend. I have accepted cold food many times, have accepted very late deliveries, have accepted your refund denials. But, there will be no acceptance if you will lose the battle against a victim card. You will also lose a loyal customer.",3
Nice service with good cashback resolve query instantly instantly delivery,5
Great experience with Zomato always.,5
So far the delivery is given..they would ask for rating..but as soon as something is worst.they have the worst customer response,1
I'm using this app only because discount offers other then that customer service is pathetic they blocked my COD because i cancelled my order after waiting a long time and they themselves displayed cancelled option while i was enquiring about delay they don't value customer loyalty I'm giving them thousands of worth business every month but just because one silly thing they blocked my COD will delete it soon,1
Awesome test ..and good timing for delivery,5
Discount percentage is not correct. If i buy a item of 350 its 50% is 175 but in zomato 50% is not applied it will give you only 100 rupee off,1
Easy to access and fast delivery,4
They have always addressed all issues promptly and very well,5
Scamming people by charging more than the price in the restaurant and also compared to other food Delivery apps. Sending bad quality food and the customer care people are not responsive they just keep ending chats,1
"Very very worst delivery app I have never seen don't order food through Zomato , swiggy is 100%better than zomato",1
The 'more info' tab that contains a lot of important details took a while to get used to,4
It is best Aap for food delivery and cheap rate,5
Bad support on my concern regarding on time or free claim. Absolutely unprofessional.,1
Your map is not working properly the service has become costly,5
"customised food is not available, e.g. if i want daal chawal or rajma chawal only it is not available. Earlier it was available.",4
Good app. But at Tinsukia why only two restaurants are shown ?,4

It is so fast delivery and it has so many restraruant and ok delivery,5
Good app all things very clear and good,5
Service is great in between lockdown periods.,5
Whenever you got a problem with your food order the support executive are only computers it didn't connect with virtual or contact less agent to resolve our problems,1
Very good for the food from you wants,4
"Worst ever online food ordering app I have ever seen, worst customer support one can see. They don't give any value to our hard earned money. They are just looting us in the name of offers and special discounts",1

"Such a pathetic and unexpected service..have ordered pav bhaji with 4extra pav from maharana kamath restuarant..but they have sent total 3pav.. 60rs gone waste..when I have called their they said,"" it's not our mistake it's Zomato's mistake they are charging extra amount from customers..and didn't even notifying us.."". Now u both decide among yourselves bcoz I m going to sue you both in consumer court for harassing the cstmr..it's not about 60rs or 3pav.. it's about the cheating loyal customers.",1
Without delivery of food app status show delivery..,1
Best delivery and fast delivery service is the best 👌,5
"Please go ahead and find out I have ordered this from one of your partner but I got very poor dinner I mean rubbish and stale food you can say rice are not boiled properly.  Manchurian balls so hard, fried rice not spicy as it's name was schezwan fried rice.  Not at all up to the mark.  As I have chat with your stupid felloew executives which they are not helpful at all.  So I request you to go ahead look for this and process for refund.",1
"tried to reach their support regarding spilled food , got no response",1
Fast and ferious delivery.,5
Worst timeline service by zomato out of every 2nd order is late plus worst chat support and service they give swiggy is much better than zomato regret using ZOMATO !!,1
Resolved issue of wrong item delivery immediately,5
"Not just one experience, quality of service has gone down,",1
Zomato App is very worth for everyone like fast delivery and supply delicious food.,5
This app is quite difficult for my parents. pls make this app suitable for my parents too that they can order food without my help.,3
The taste was great and rich quality .,5
"Pathetic. The restaurant sent an incomplete order, however Akash at Zomato offered a 38aed refund and then reverses what he initially offered after my bad service rating, and then decides I deserve an 12aed refund (what a coincidence). All I wanted was what I ordered with my meal, and not a refund of my money.",1
Totally in love with this app Fast delivery Minimal calling,5
Very useful and valuable during this pandemic,5
Food is good but food took over an hour to arrive and was cold,3
"Worst service, I order one birth day cake, but they delivered plain cake, with out writing birthday wishes and name also",1
Very poor support. And send diffrent orders,1
Order takes too much longer than usual. That too from a eatery outside my society gate.,1

"I am using this app from last 2-3 years continues, There a big prblm in this app, if I face any prblm during or after my order , then I have to cntct Zomato executive by chat only, and 99% executive use to transfer my query to another executive ...

"DUDE THEY TAKE MY MONEY, DON'T EVEN DELIVER. AND THEN THEY SAY THE REFUND WILL TAKE LIKE A BLOODY WEEK. AND THEN I GOTTA KEEP TRACKING IT FOR DAYS. IT KEEPS HAPPENING. ORDERS KEEP GETTING CANCELLED.",1
No problem of delivery boy the problem is that the food is not testy. And not healthy 😕,1

"Does not allow customer to mention his requirement in chat section,rest there is no other way to communicate with tthem,one sided communication never helps anybody.",1
Pathetic app... Showing promocode which is not working,1
On time delivery and very polite delivery executive,5
"when i open app , every time ask and search my current location , why ? its should be ask every time when i place a order ,",3
I waited almost an to get my order at last minute they called and said that their Zomato wallet couldn't able to deliver the order and it was my first order.,1
"5 times given order but, only one time provide fresh & hot pizza . 4times not hot, untaste, tightness pizza base. Late deliverey also. Good bye forever this worthless zomato.",1
In the beginning I loved Zomato But when I ordered pizza on time delivery it was supposed to come within 11.35 to 11.45 At 11.35 it changed to 11.55 Why do u cheat ur customers? Never gonna order again,1
"Excellent services provided by Zomato. I am happy to see that all the representatives are professional and knowledgeable. Behavior of all the staff are very polite and respectful. Delivery of material are made in a professional manner, and please see that the materials are properly sealed and tagged while delivering to customers. Regards",5
very nice app for getting high class eatable at vety reasonable prices,5
Order received was not in proper condition.,2
Have ordered Dal Makhani and Roti today frm Celebration Hotel via Zomato App. Was delivered Dal Tadka which obviously was cheaper. Money is secondary but this was sheer false practice conducted by you guys. Money was paid THROUGH/TO Zomato & have been delivered A) Incorrect Order B) Have been charged more to what have been delivered. Bloody Fraud and Looting customer's money,1
Don't use this app they send the bad smelling food and their customer representative are not responding now worst food i have received today and they are saying that we are not responsible u must have told before that you people are not responsible for it i would have went out and have the meal cheaters.You people should send your man to check it out.,1

It's same even after complaining.. no step has taken.. I think this is app for their profit...they don't do anything for customer......CHEATERS,1
A very nice app....do order from zomato,4
One of the best online food ordering app . I love using this app.. they also give discounts. Although some people treat delievery bhaiyas very bad.,4
No offers at all when compared to other competitors and delivery charges going up daily along with other added charges,1
"I did not receive my order but the application interface is displaying that the order was delivered and asking for the feedback of the food. They are cheating people's money. Not even giving option to talk to their executives to lodge the complain. Nobody is there to hear complain. This is the second time I'm facing this issue. This time, I sue them in the consumer forum.",1
"Late delivery, poor customer care, and surprisingly the delivery boy and hotel people are asking for delivery charges from customers, zomato if want to do business should do with outmost respect to customer otherwise they should stop doing business, its the breach of customer rights upon paying the bill they are seperately asking for delivery charges before delivering the food in guntakal madeena multi cuisine restaurant , zomato should provide complete customer care or should stop it completely",1
Getting food deliveries too late because of multiple orders given to the delivery boy.,2
Easy to order and always saves money,5
Very good service all over. I recommend this to everyone👍👍,5
Orderd pizza from dominoz and order cancelled by delivery boy after waiting 1hr....uninstalling app rt now...,1

Delivery delayed some times rest all good,5
"Not so good, orders mainly take way too much time.",3

Delivery charges and taxes have increased.,1
Chat support is not good not connected with agent,1
Good Experience...fast service.,5

Worst service ever. Ordered food from hardees. It took 4 hours for them to deliver and food was completely cold. Deleting zomato and going installing another app.,1
"Don't want to describe my experience..just want to share bring that delivery guy back.. that guy is innocent, need justice otherwise I will uninstall this app and already rated but I pledge I will make minimum 1000 people to uninstall this app and provide 1 star to this app... investigate and then take decision whatever u want.",1

Poor customer care support. These ppl just need money. Even if we receive a worst quality food we have only two options you have to eat it because you have paid for it or you have to throw it in trash because it's just your own money getting wasted who cares. Very poor.,1
Fastest dilevery and nice behavior.. Loved zomato,5
"I am very disappointed with Zomato delivery boy..he was very rude and impolite.. when I called to him and asked about the order, he said that no idea about the location and started abusing us..even after abusing we did not receive our food..such a pathetic service and worst experience with you guys...now going to uninstall this app..I will make sure that any friend of mine don't place the order from Zomato...",1

Pathetic service.. when I had to cancel an order..they asked me to email them and and was promised I will get a reply in 48 hours..how stupid can these people get.. I am going to delete my account...and guys this is what happens when there is monopoly of one company..,1
Good experience 😊 want more resturant options to be available to our area,5

Good but little expensive than retail price,4
"Neverr going to recommend this. I ordered food from here twice and it was delivered in a bad condition as if someone has already opened and had some of my food which is sooo terrible. I called the restaurant complaining for this and they send me a photo of the food while it was handed over to the dilevery boy. And by the time it reached home it was again in a bad condition and the quantity was also half. Very very very bad, terrible experience.",1
Worst food ordering app. Food not delivered and marked in app as delivered without any refund.,1
Good and fast delivery,5
"Best service, best discount, really helpful",5
"You are doing a great job, in this pandemic time not only helping to people to get food also helping to small businesses to survive.",5
Chat is not working No one cares about customer issue,2

Horrible experience. You guys ruined my mom's birthday. Also the chat option doesn't seem to work.,1
Easy to get delicious food at any location..,5

Very nice ordering and delivery app.,5
"When restaurant is delaying the order, customer is charged cancellation fees ... So, they cannot cancel the order and Zomato entertain cheat restaurant like Lapinos in spite of all such issues... Won't order from Zomato at all next time",1
No Call back no refund... Zomato is least bothered about the food quality the restaurant is deliverying ... only promises nothing else worst experience ... No customer service...,1
Zomato gives worst service and disgusting support to customers. Nobody should order food from Zomato as they don't bothered about customer need i.e. specially food. If you request for support for better service they won't respond you properly.,1
"Dude this is like a chef for me anything, anytime I ordered I get that with super taste and full of appetite 🤤😋 Thanku so much ❤️",5
Horrible experience on a recent order I waited for an hour and then the delivery guy calls me and tells me he met an accident whereas his phone was busy since the time he picked up the order.. Wonder if he was eating it or having a time off.. horrible Zomato,1
I just love zomato because food is so delicious as well as fast delivery.,5
"Wish I could give negative rating. Issues are as follows 1. Being the first,I am allowed to get 150 /- off.The clever Zomato cancel my first order and in return said sorry (where the hell I should I take your sorry).This means I won't be able to be allowed 150/- on next order. Wahhhh you consider yourself very clever. Very very very very pooooor service and poor show.",1
Best customercare service as compaired with swiggy. Offers are value for money,5
"Expensive service, no added benefits for the pro users..",2
Fraud and scam app..my sister and my self ordered same cake from same shop but got 2 different price.. pathetic,1
Best and very friendly for users,5
Really a good app and believe me service is so fast 😍,5
It was a horrible experience.i found a bug in my food(biryani) and when I asked for the refund they are saying we will provide you refund only for 1 item(biryani) I just want to ask if you find a bug in one item will you eat the other items ????,1
Made in India food delivery app. Should also includes small vendors as well under voice for local.,5
Very good service and food also.,5
"This KFC outlet lies in Pacific Mall, serves a very nice, delicious and mouth watering food and snacks which are of international level. The ambience as well as the Cleanliness is on highest level. Staff is very courteous and cooperative as well as prices are quiet reasonable keeping quality of stuff in mind. rao Space is also available.",5
Service is good compare to swiggy.. less delivery time,4
Poor issue resolution time Poor back end support,2
Worst customer service. I was put on hold for mpre than 45 min. Told I would get promotion credits of 100 but they only added 50 rs . Cheaters and liars. Never going to use this again .,1
Bad customer service They even can't change my phone number after i changed and complained so many times Other than taking our money and they refund after 10 days even when its their mistake Dont know how they allow them to do business in Dubai !!!,1
My complains were not accepted & answered properly .very bad experienced received .Zomato doesn't responds to its customers appropriately .,1
Excellent & Perfect Time Delivery service 🤗🤗🤗🤷🏻‍♂️,5
"I ordered at 06.29 from JBs Guwahati .It was showing that ordered will be delivered at 07.16 and it was not delivered to us till 8 PM. When we contacted the restaurant they informed us that the item was prepared long before but no one come to take the delivery item. When we contacted the delivery boy , he didn't received the call. Then we contacted Zomato but they keep changing the executive but no one resolved the issue. pathetic customer service",1
Till date best experience...thank you to reach to everyone in this bad covid situation too. Specially the delivery people take so much risk..thank you once again..keep doing this great job..🙂,5
Worst experience Menu is changed after payment Fraud company Dont expect this from this big company but your software not working properly and your executive dont want to understand anything,1
"No resolution on time , customer care representatives not giving any resolution on time poor services zomato",1
cakes are fresh with perfect taste,4
"Order accept and not provide dinner 🍲. Also refund not provide me.. All are do the fraud with customers. Dear team, Your team not provide proper response on chat of Zomato application. Still I am not received my order, inspite of status showing that I have received the same. What the hel are going.?",1
Great at handling complaints and refund. ...,5
Very much rate variation in actual price and showing price on zomato,1
Chat and user grievances redressal is very efficient,5
Good Offers And Coupons. Also Fast Delivery,4
"Very very poor service, support executive leave the chat in between conversation",1
There rider was not in 50meters of radius and still they are telling he was great Zomato keep going and keep looting money but stop this nonsense on time or free thing ridiculous,1
The company thinks that any mistake can be justified by refunding the amount I was delivered a cold pizza and when I complained the restaurant they replied that the Zomato vallet was not having any hot bag (which I saw) resulting in cold delivery And when I registered a complaint on the chat they just said we will refund the amount. Not a trust worthy app Just call the restaurant and get the food delivered rather than ordering on ZOMATO,1
Supportive & good quality of services.,4
"Excellent job very fast delivery 🚚 the, 👏👏👏👌",5
Zomato platform exploiting its customers under the name of terms and conditions. Its misusing people lack of awareness and busyness. During COVID Times it's falsely advice that few tie up restaurants are using max safety precautions. However neither Zomato nor its agents following the guidelines. Also the restaurants using dangerous polythene bags to pack foods which is dangerous to health.,1
Even with Pro subscription they charge for delivery... 😑 Swiggy Super gives free delivery on order above ₹149,1
Always my first choice for online food delivery and search of new restaurants,5
Punctual and well behaved. Very good.,5
Good delivery on time.good response at a time,5
"Easy deliver food on time , food is tasty and hot",5
Always late Even after charging almost 30 40rs delivery fees just for a 10 min ride,1
"Again worst experience with zomato. I dint received the order even after 2 hrs from placing it. When I called the executive he said, he had delivered the items. After 30 mins he called back and said he forgot to collect my order from the restuarant. Such ppl will be hired in zomato. Even after 4 days I dint receive my refund. Swiggy is far far better..",1
Very good with the food and delivery partners,5
Took a lot of time to deliver the food. Delayed delivery.,1
"Worst experiance ever..delivery was too late,delivery boy's used bad language..food was so bad..i don't like it..",1
Very understanding and excellent customer service,5
Three star because you collecting more money for delivered for near by hotel. Nearly.534 metres you collecting rupees 45 and extra tax also 😡😡😡😡,3
"If u have placed an order, u can not cancel it ,if u have placed 1 sec before",1
My revirw was 5 ⭐star for zomato for good service and food. But i reduced that because they do not give justice to kamraj. Infact they suporting a overattitude girl hitesha who dying for eat free food.,2
Time mentioned to deliver was almost half as compare to actual delivery.,2
Deleviry was good but some items were missing when delivered...,4
There is no option to chat with customer support in latest update.,3
They provide bad service and after that don't resolve customer issue.,1
Fastest delivery and clean,4
very bad test and food is not fresh it looks like food is cooked before 2 days,1
Your company is cheating with us. Taken a order and given time 32 minuts after that your person taken double order and coming from another long root so totak delivery time is now more than 45 minuts,1
Very bad app.. Dont seek out the customer's grief and problems..,1
Their customer service sucks big time. A Ms. Cathrine was worse than AI in understanding my problem,2
"delivery boy was at time but food was totally open twice, naan was too much rough like leather, biryani was average.. vry bad experience ever👿😈😡",1
Nice.. and... but make an option not to limit tip to rider make it 10-30rps don't put it compulsory 20rs,5
Great app with quick and easy to use.,5
Good Medium to order food online. Quality restaurants posted on Zomato,5
Map auto zoom out should be removed,3
Very helpful app. Old age people single ladies. And others usage this app. Thank you,5
This app just very irresponsible.. which will not provide any services to customers..they always give some rubbish reason to fake..,1
Very good app delivered the food in 31 minutes,5
Order directly from resturant Zomato after taking delivery charges still charge you more than restaurant menu price,1
One of the worst app I ever used in my life. It doesn't give cash on delivery option on my id worst app,1
"Very bad services,wrong items delivered ..no body responsible from Zomato services site to resolve it..no help ..very bad nd experience.. it's not expecting from Zomato .. Request all consumer please check twice before accepting frm Zomato delivery boys...at end Zomato helpdesk not ready to help you",1
The app have many flaws in there system as said by the executive of Zomato so I think the app is unfit for this,1
"Except few issues , excellent app",5
"They are playing with customers money and time That's way they don't have complain support place Lost my money, if we complain in the chat support, they offer cheaply 20 rs credit points for rs 500 order That zomato, zomato is growing by playing with customers money and time I Complained so many times but there is no responses from zomato If we complain they offer cheaply 20 credit points and then close the issue",1
Best App. Great Customer service and offers.,5
Zomato members taking extra charge 40 Rs but food will super fast arriving also I like this app,3
Can we have schedule delivery options so user can plan their lunch or dinner or party well in advance.,4
Not delivering the order on time. My order came after 2 hrs infact calling the delivering man many times,1
I ordered Cake from the application .and was poorly handled by the delivery guy . The cake was tossed inside the package and lost all beauty 😤😤😤,1
I was really hugry and ive ordered food but the restuarant people didnt accepted i ve raised an complaint to zomato app thats was very quick restuarant accepted my order. Thanks guys,5
seriving on remote location with quality food superb,5
Can't submit issues while the order is getting delayed,1
Its good by first order i was pay in upi and they didn't confirm my order my money is still processing,4
It's only issue is.. that's the only thing we can use. Monopoly causing them to be rude.. allowing them to bend rules for their choice,1
Just spoke to the customer service and it was a very bad experience after the chat was escalated,1
"Worst service missing items, support not upto the mark..",1
"Very conflicting experience. On one hand, i was waiting for my food and the valet showed delivered when he did not even call me. On the other hand, zomato was very fast in initiating refund. I was left hungry at the end of the day. U decide.",3
"Delivery charge, delivery surge, taxes.. anything else? Add more names to take more money.",2
It's very handy app....easy to use...happy with Zomato🤗👏,4
Fast delivery. And more offers available. We are expecting more,5
Just fee click and order of ur meal in ur door step awesome,5
"Horrible. Valet not taking calls. Zomato saying sorry sorry and sorry. Ordered at 7 pm, food not delivered till 9 pm. Disappointed, pathetic, Manegerial issues.",1
Good work done.very usefull app.liked service very much keep it up. ..........................,5
I recieved some different order and zomato refund money within 30min of my complaint... Thank you so much,5
"Worst experience,food quality very much worst,plz ensure that food will be good which u guyz delivered,it is impacting are health as well...not happy with food quality",1
"Good service, good discount we gets, over all good",5
Best service ....good.. Delivery boy behaviour very good..polite.. softspoke Thanks Zamato,5
"Location tracking service of Zomato is not so good , need to improve👎",1
"Dear Zomato, can you please stop those annoying notifications every day which just try to 'convince' me I deserve tasty food, blah blah food instead of home cooked food. It's cheap to be honest and you come across as a desparate company seriously.",2
Best quality 👌 and timely delivery.,5
"Their service sucks!! If there is an issue with the order, there is no resolution. All they would say is "" we will pass on the message to the restaurant"". And their offers are namesake. Delivery on time or free - They promised to deliver in 38 mins and the delivery guy arrived after a good hour. But the support guy says its only 1 min delay so we won't pay. Then they say you have not added some absurd option. Ridiculous.",1
Every alternate order is delivered late and there is no point of complaining about it as they dont even care.,1
This app is world's worst app I my views.. I have ordered paranthas from this app and that parantha made with rotten paneer and told them to take back this order and return my money or a replacement order but the customer care guy mr Swaraj told me that he apologize but not taken the order back and refuse to give and replacement order or money back.. this experience they provide their customers.. thanks Zomato,1
"I ordered item from Zomato, I received incorrect item which I could not eat. I had faced worst experience with zomato. And I had chat with executive also but no one has given proper answer. I don't where I need to contact. Really disappointed with zomato",1
In mostly cases zomato don't change it's time😑... even if zomato boy is late still they increase or stop the time,2
No option to type in chat,1
Please add description of all items of the hotels and add correct photo of the items,4
Arrogance personified chat replies and refunds are never to source accounts. Refunds are in coupons. Others such a SWIGGY etc are miles and a thousand times better than ZOMATO,1
Really very good app for food my oder within 17 mins 😄😃😃😀,5
It's good But some times when we order any of the meal Below 300Rs it adds up extra amount,4
Taking more time than what is shown while placing the order,1
Good offers and on time delivery,5
"Extremely feeling bad in writing this review. Never expected this from zomato. But today they did a fraud case with cricket world cup coupon. After contacting the customer service they gave a lame condition, which is not even mention in their rules.",3
Very bad experienced the way the food has been handled during delivery.,1
"Swiggy is better.,Zomato is very slow in their deliveries.",2
One of the most horrible service. Delivery executive is unnecessarily rude and customer service just believes in apologizing.,1
"Offlate their services are pathetic. Today I have invested my priceless almost an hour and not getting any output. The food was yak, I had thrown, quantity was poor and after that I chatted with Zomato guys for almost an hour and literally ZERO output. Problem, Zomato don't have any tuff competitor in india, that's why they take the customer lightly and taken the customer granted. Anyone time can't be compensated by a token. Looking for quality service and food.",1
brilliant app but needs to reduce the extra charges,5
Good food delivery app location is perfect 👍 thank you for zomato,5
Worst service..food will be opened by delivery boys they will eat nd pack as again..no support or compensation provided if u raise issue,1
Nice app for urgent delivery THANKS! a lot zomato,5
It is better but sometime menu will not appear,3
If near by restaurant will be delivered then it's much better,3
Amazing app so easy and fast delivery,5
Bhai .. kitna extra price add karogey plus delivery charges ..... Worts app ever .. u made food out of reach from normal people.. pethatic.. apda ko avsar main badal rahey hy,1
Zomato has written the prices are controlled by establishment not by Zomato it's fake ... The prices of dishes in actual restaurant are very less as compared to the menu provided by Zomato ... Pls don't fake people by writting this ... U can actually beg people for money .. that we are providing u serivices and we will charge for our services... But not by faking ... Example u can chek the price of chole bhature of sita ram per plate is 70 and at Zomato it's 110 🙏🙏,1
I have been ordering frm zomato for a while...and its really satisfying...the delivery and everything.... 🌺❤️❤️,5
Useless offers n services. You won't get survive any longer this way.. if you cant provide service in metro city like amdawad... Why we should pay Surcharge. Please improve.. or Be ready for closing n locking up.,1
Sometimes I got disappointed with this app. Because I didn't have an option for order. It shows the restaurant can't deliver food in your area. But again sometimes I satisfied to have delicious food.,5
"I placed an order which showed delivery time 60 mins. I requested the team to expedite the order if possible as I had not eaten all day. 60 mins later, when I checked with the delivery boy, he asked me to wait another 45 mins. The zomato exec assured me that the food would reach in 15-25 mins. After 2 hours of waiting, the Zomato Exec cancelled my order without my consent and said place a new order now at 12 am. When I demanded to speak to a supervisor, he refused to let me.",1
Excellent app and delivery and items also,5
Not meeting delivery times lines always.,3
Nice service. Could try to a little more fast,3
Horrible..I got wrong food delivered and when I wanted to complain the app had bugs..my money is wasted. I regret using Zomato.,1
"Zomato gave 2 different orders to one delivery boy .I ordered around 10:16 PM .Its now 11:49PM I have not received my order.As per delivery boy,Zomato had assigned two deliveries to same boy as a result inspite of my order being ready the delivery boy had to wait for second delivery which resulted in delay of my order by almost 1 hour 40 mins and still counting. What's the use of paying more to Zomato when they cannot deliver us on time. The Restaurant informed us that the order was ready.",1
My money debited twice on 25th jan till now it's not refunded very bad didn't refund the money 1142 rps,4
"It's been a very long time for which I have been using zomato. I have been more than happy with their service. Almost all of the times the food was delivered on time, and in a very properly packed condition. During the very few cases that food was delayed, their excellent customer service team helped a lot. Plus their UI is really nice and easy to understand. Zomato is my number 1 food delivery app.",5
I love zomato. But today I had faced an incident it was very bad. Your delivery person was ver rude. Never expected this from zomato,1
"Doesn't work properly, a lot of glitched",1
Your app is getting annoyingly slow... Wanted to delete it forever..,1
never updates and menus are always out of date,1
try for auto OTP read for faster check out.,4
"Zomato is an amazing food delivery collaboration. It's reach is quite wide, from smallest of the restaurants to the well renowned ones. Am having to cut off the 5th star only becoz of the haphazard faced regarding missed items, or wrong delivery which has happened very minimum times, but still happened, which Zomato yet needs to improve. However, nevertheless, am a happy client.",4
"Good Food app, helpful and easy",4
Osm food . quality . delivery very fast great job Zomato,5
Thank you zomato for providing food on time...specially for home quarantine people.....,5
Delivery surge is too high,1
"Zomato increases the price of food but original price is lower in restaurants,hotel etc",1
Swiggy has lesser delivery charges and better offers than Zomato.,1
This is very useful as u have upgraded your service than the older version...,5
Great payment options and fantastic offers and promos,5
Very perfect app for ordering food,5
"great food and hospitality, loved it.will surely visit again",5
"Easy, smooth and timely operation. Keep it up.",4

Some Time Don't Have Any Responsibility What Customers Actually Ordered I Ordered Cheese Burst Pizza And Give Me A Mayonis Feeled Pizza By Star One Pizza They Thought The Customer Never Ever Had A Actual Cheese Burst Pizza Then Serve Them Any Items But Good For More Time Best App,5
Delivery time showing wrong when delivery boy have multiple orders.,1
Best service. Fast action on customer complaint,5
I found it easy and good food at ur doorstep,4
All poor restaurants are listed in zomato in my area who delivers poor quality foods. I was unable to eat that food after 15 hours of starvation. Such a low quality of food.,1
It's great job by Zomato. I request you to work on placing order at once from two different restaurants as one bill amount.,4
Almost all the orders running late. Do not use if you're in hurry.,1
Good service and Very Bad Discount not give,5
Bulk deliveries ... U have to wait for ur turn... For 30 mins it will show delivery time 10mins ...And then they give 50 rs discount as begger...,1

Nice experience with Zomato but till now. Keep the good service.,4
"Not deliverable at our Goregaon East -400065, wherein all major deliveries are happening in our location, especially big basket, swiggy, Amazon.",1
Fast service and good food,5
"Our family was very hungry we thought about order some from ""Zomato""! But there is no source of cod(cash on delivery)means u Don't have online payment system...then don't come at Zomato Zomato is only making deliverys for online payments...!",1
You should add option for cash on delivery,3
Not received order yet its been 1 and a half hour still showing on the way,2
Order came in time. Quality of food was okay.,4
"You guys have guts to take away my customer care service option, I am really angry and mad, in Feb I didn't got my refund of 350 rps I had spoken to so many of thier customer service guys, they said to have patience, today after months I asked for help also showed my passbook entries, to make sure they never transferred any money back to me and these guys just removed the option of customer service from my app, wow I am never ever going to use this app Now!",1
Nice service and the timing is good,4
Best it is easy to use and order and best,5
This nice app to order food and delivery the food,5
I'm happy always when ordering in zomato the service was good for me,5
Nice app and better option if anyone wants food at his home,5
Quick order placement and confirmation.,4
Really good app. Much easier to use than the swiggy app,5
Welcome offer is good one...nice app and time to delivery,5
Lags a lot while tracking food delivery,3
Easy to order. Good offers,5
You should generat premium customer data base and make them more discount and extra facilities,4
Good and fast delivery,4
Very bad the delivery boy accepted the and he still not received the order from restaurant and am waiting here for food it's very bad,1
"Waste service from team, delivery boys gives wrong numbers and chat team gives late reply. Do not may online payments. Zomato atleast do not contact us, they simple say we will refund money,, very bad service",1
"Very bad service,.delivery timing issues",1
Superb experience ... Very fast process..,5
"Fantastic delivery,very fast",1
"Never take action on any complaints or bad review against any retaurant. Also, actively promote the restaurant by manipulating their ratings in the app.",2
"Poor experience. It's pot-luck as to whether your card is accepted or not. Then you can wait 40 mins for your order, to only then be told ""sorry, it's cancelled"" When it did work for me, the live tracking view is dodgy. Said the driver was 4 mins away for about 20 mins and the guy was outside the whole time.",1
very slow in terms of delivery If u choose pro they will give on time but if didn't choose it they will deliver it on double the time It's a business strategy for forcing to take pro,1
Good delivery app...Delivery staff also good behaviour...,4
"I'm am a regular user of this app from past 5 years. This app has become the worst in the last few years. Now being a new mom and dealing with lot of stress, the luxury of getting food at door step is one of the must needs. But I've met with worst experience, waiting for food for three hours and getting false message of delivered. After a rigorous chat with the ""support"" excutives i get false promises of money being refunded to my account. 500+ rupees is not a small amount to let go. Worst app.",1
Such a waste app never in my life .when I book the order he will say of an hour to come and comes after 2 hours time waste app . Iam saying truly don't install this app .,1
"The Zomato is the worst food app, always delayed the food delivery and never gave customer service properly , customer satisfaction forget it, all worst restuarant with good ratings",1
"Initially the service was upto the mark but recently I have faced many issues. I had to face missing order issue several times and the sad part is even after sending them the proof, customer service people doesn't believe it! Its totally not worth your money and time. I will make sure that myself, my family and friends none of them use zomato. If there was zero rating I would given that!",1
Best hunger solution.. would be great if the come up with more offers...,4
"Ordered at 8.15pm and delivered at 9.45pm.ordered birayani from persiyana hyderabadi vasant vihar which was cold and tasteless, did they changed the parcel? God knows. Delivery time posted was 45 min and took delivery charges Rs57/- this is actually fooling people.",1
Fast delivery excellent service,5
Delivery Charge and promotions needs improvement... rest all is 🙂,3
"You need food after 3 hrs of ordering, then order in zomato.you want food on time then talabat is the place",1
This is the best app. Whenever we want anything it deliveres very fast,5
Very good 👍 Giving us the rout map of your representative is a good thought.,5
What is point of delievery charges if they took an hr to deliver it... Very bad exp from Zomato as compared to swiggy,1
The coupons will not work on final payments & it will not process Worst,1
Very helpful very helpful to this lockdown time.,5
Worst app . Order cancelled by restaurant but payment not refund on time,1
They charge more for each dish. .. in reality the restaurant prices are less than the price for each dish on zamato,1
Very good offers & very fast service.,5
Pathetic Customer service. Even after giving feedback on delayed orders for so many times no improvement,1
"Late delivery and bad quality foods With high salt,not eatable Suffered heath issues Resulting high blood pressure And when contacted the customer care executive it has taken 100 minutes to get the refund when I have therented for legal action Very poor service and post sale's service Very good customer service from swiggy always within 15 minutes Cheater company Zomato",1
Excellent App . Best Offers.,5
"Do not provide multiple orders to rider, it takes too much time for delivery",3
Great experience.... Still some places are not mentioned!,4
"Hey Guys! Today I had ordered Domino's Pizza at 7:51 PM via Zomato and I received Pizzas in exactly an hour later which is at 8:50 PM. But the Pizzas inside the boxes were in very cold condition which I was unable to eat, or nobody will ever intend to eat with lots of cold cheese inside it. I hope you people will be able to imagine the taste of Pizza at that time. So, I thought of raising this issue since it was a very genuine and explainable reason. So, I raised the issue to chat support and I am completely shocked to see that these guys started making vulnerable excuses and never intended to provide a solution. After-all, a Sorry won’t feed my hunger, so there is no valid point to do that unnecessarily. I only asked to the customer support executive to either send me the same food order again in eatable conditions or initiate a refund ASAP. And the same story continued as they said that they are unable to do so and just said sorry for the inconvenience. When I prompted repeatedly to find some better solution than that chat support executive just cancelled my chat support without even solving the issue. After requesting again and again over the chat support a new person was assigned to the issue, and the same repeated things continues. Sometimes they say Domino's will support us on this issue, sometimes they say wait for two hours, sometimes they say they will transfer the chat to higher team and the same excuses goes on. In this whole process I am already very hungry and had no money left to order another food, which I have already shared to them over chat support. But sadly, today I will have to sleep hungry because nobody even wants to understand the genuine complaints made by customers. Zomato this is very-very poor and pathetic service I have ever seen. I feel so helpless and cheated and will surely share this thing all over the social media and let's hope if something happens. Zomato lacks customer service. Guys, please share this as much as you can so that the quality and service will improve better next time onward and nobody will be looted by food delivery platforms. Thanks!",1
Good experience..quality and good promo codes..decent discounts,5
sometimes it happens but 15% complaint only,4
Nice app to eat every time everywhere. Excellent service,5
User friendly app. Good service so far.,5
"Luring people to get registered on the app by giving them coupon codes and when people actually try to order something, the code doesnt work and there is no support from the zomato customer support team",1
I love the abundance of food choices this app gives. Makes my life colorful spicy n exciting...,5
this is an awesome app to find new places to go eat,5
images of food items are not often available like swiggy btw that's it,3
Very much disappointed with quality of food swiggy is good in terms of price and no proper customer care..,1
"very late delivery, almost 1hr after order was served",1
Excellent service even at late night.😀,5
Ok good must improve in location tracking,4
Food items are almost always cheaper in restaurants than on zomato app...,1
Great ! Always on time....loved offers thus provided,5
"Good service, delivery on time.",5
Very quickly delivery and polite staff,5
GOOD experience with this app... love to place order with it.,5
Nice app but it costs us more than expected 💯...,2

The app is altogether the best and offers are at the beat...,5
It's really an amazing delivery app for the best restaurant's,5
It's an amazing app to order food,5
"Worst food app, every time I order wrong item or food is getting delivered.",1
Prices are too high and no such good discount are available as compared to swiggy,1
Disgusting and wired.. all the support I got is zomato had given a Stern feedback to the vendor and the vendor got scared off 😂😂,1
"Quick service, The behaviour of velet excellent",5
Worst app for food. They force to add more iteam and force to buy premium membership,1
I ordered something and i didn't get it but i got a msg that your order has been collected in 32 minutes wow but I didn't get that chutiyr bhrti kite hoye,1
So good App. when u Feel Hungry let's Do it Zomato.Easy to use,5
"No proper customer support. Hidden charges even for pro member, Pathetic service .",4
They have discontinued many offer. Sometimes their offer doesnot even honored. Earlier they gave me Free Pro membership considering my usage. This time they want Rs.200 to be paid for the pro membership. Basically they do not honor loyal customer.,1
Zomato # All parcels reached before time. Hats off to their service.,5
Cake was frozen and got displaced from the board.,2
On time or free is fake. I got the order around 1:48PM which was supposed to be delivered before 1:43. Zomato cheaters,1
I like the convenience of re-ordering dishes,4
Super and good service,4
After 7 min the time does not move.,1
"I ordered pahalwan very bad experience abt packing issue, charged more than mkt, even onion is nt available there in salad Sorry, i think next time",1
"It's ok, but delivery charges and taxes are too high...",4
"Food and restaurant ratings are all fake, no discounts offer and the food experience is equally pathetic.",1
Good delivery for fast and delicious tast.,4
It's been a very fascinating journey with you'll. Keep the great work going on.. I love the statement deli very very very fast😂😂. So innovative. Love u guys. ❤️ Keep rocking as always,5
"This place makes you regret for everything....pathetic service & worthless food. No hygienic measures taken, over crowded & after 45-50 minutes of wait time you're served burnt tasteless food!!! This place makes you regret on your decision about choosing it(OFCOURSE CONSIDERING THE ZOMATO, GOOGLE ETC. REVIEWS) to celebrate your leisure time or any special with your loved once. I ended wasting my bucks as I had no other option left to choose from, after waiting for 50 odd minutes making",1
Would have given 5 stars but no more good promocode offers like used to months ago,4
Good service with reasonable price,5
Worst food offering at vzm....and they are not responding to customers to solve their food issues......Im not satisfied with Zomato customer care W,1
Very easy to use this app...Fastest delivery ever....🤩🤩,5
Worst service since last 20 min the order is ready and the driver is not assigned,1
Experience was not good reason being the order was done by mistake. I realized the same within time and informed within 5 minutes to cancel the order. Revert from your Team was strange and hard to digest as according to them Order is ready and order can't be cancelled. This clearly means that the Food was already prepared and we will always receive non Fresh Food while ordering from Zomato. Considering this bad experience I would like to avoid ordering from Zomato.,1
I have placed order at 5pm..it takes ages to come..till now not delivered.,1
Prices are very much inflated and quality food is not available,1
"Good experience app on all orders, love to use this app, better than others too, request for more offers Love you ZOMATO",5
"Zomato Customer Care Sucks. Even after sharing proper proofs, order list screenshot agents were not able to help and finally no one replied.",1
Price for delivery is too high... Need more offers for foods...,2
Love that i can use my card points in purchasing meals!,5
"I raised my issue on mail several times, but they didn't responded yet,",1
Zomato just act as a platform....not look for quantity and quality of food delivered..you have to look it...i become fool twice from a same restaurant.,3
Too good service. Always made me happy 😀😀,5
Overall experience is good but Pro option is little bit costly.,5
the Zomato application is so much usefull I m much satisfied of Zomato..,5
Sharing My experience with @junkyardcafe_saket ... it was awesomely amazing!! Had a blast on their #saturdaybollywoodnight The food was delicious! Me & friend enjoyed the #chickenpizza #cheesepizza #frenchfries🍟 #dahikebab The ambiance was excellent for us & parents and the service was good even on a busy Saturday night! #bollywoodnight rocked! We shall see you soon!,5
Worst experience ever.. Everytimr they take 52 or 62 rs as delivery charge.. They are totally making fool by providing discounts. Also the packaging of zomato is worst.,1
Wine shop feature is not showing since 25 days.,2
I am downgrading because of delivery time. I had to wait 2.45 mins for food.,3
Very good service (atleast in my area),5
Great App.. Easy to order.,5
Super fast delivery Excellent delivery man's very very very super,4
"Bad service, my chats are not seen and no resolution is provided",1
Most unprofessional. Delayed delivery. No way to connect to any one except the delivery person,1
App layout can be better with dishes pictures,4
Customer support is pathetic. It is impossible to reach an executive even after waiting for hours. Horrible for food delivery.,1
In most cases food description doesn't match with the restaurant,4
Great app to order food in lockdown,5
Very fast delivery and test food,5
Good.... Really useful during covid situation...,5
Very nice app 👌 but if it can give more offers of pizaa like in 200 rupees 3 pizza 🍕,5
No safety with Zomato #zomatocheats. No response on any emergency reported. No helpline to report either. Don't reply with automated replies for reviews... Ppl are not that stupid. Ticket id is 7579412,1
"Zomato's Support system is a BIG failure!! THEY COULDN'T HELP, WHEN INCOMPLETE ITEMS WERE DELIVERED TO ME. Stop LOOTING your Customers!!!",1
Horrible service. Worst support. We place an order of was a big order. They sent bad and stinking food. We contacted help line. Helpline kept on saying we will do some thing wait wait and wait and latter on they stopped taking my msg. I lost my money they took me for a ride that they are contacting resturent. And now they blocked me from chat. Never go with Zomato pakka fraud company. You will lose your money.,1
"Always highlights Non-veg food centres, a few vegetarian food centres around my place dont deliver food to my location.",1
No any options for type in chat for your query of order,1
perfect place for good and quality food for foodies,5
Good Service & Good Discount.,5
"Order placement doesn't work, the customer service is the worst. They don't know how to talk to the customers.",1
Good service but tooooo much late for delivery,5
The worst customer service ever. No one replies even having a problem with the order..,1
"simple & quick app , appreciate the developer . Having said earlier regarding your service now you brought me down with ONE stroke . want to contact you for more than 45 minutes but no avail . please grow up & response to . A coustomer is NOT a obstruction but he is part of your business",4
Very nice app I really 34 order but not describe to me really nice app tried to it😋😋,5
Very good delivery in proper time,4
Very unfriendly app as no customer care no. to raise the issues,1
Worst experience with Zomato I don't know why Zomato take dilevery charge Zomato should not take delivery charge,1
It's a good service app for food but there is less offer than swiggy,4
Very bad app. I have cancelled my pro membership because the app was so bad. There is no one to talk if you get bad food. You can't even talk to an executive. They say write a mail but nobody replies. Very bad app will be uninstalling ASAP.,1
Good app with fast delivery,5
Very bad app cant pay online.. Not possible at all.. No option for Cash On Delivery also..,1
"Unable to view cart for payment,worst app issues",1
Surge charges is just too much.,1
Excellent Taste with Quality and Quanity,5
No decent offers but they hold monarchy as of now.... Good in overall though,4
It has started charging more and there is frequent delay in orders,1
I ordered same food many times I just loved my order and best offers,5
Not too good experience for me. This one star is bcz of my kindness but i am not interested in this app now. I fell better to cook my food by myself🤞🤞,1
"Fast delivery, representatives are good",5
its awesome it's very useful and safe even in covid 19 time they r using safety measures good 👍,5
"Some restaurants on this app has no customer service at all, service is becoming useless now 😡",1
Nice service and offers on order.,5
Zomato is the most useless brand they don't value our time i guess we have to order one day earlier in zomato swiggy i much better. Rate is also high in zomato and delivery also not in time,1
recently joined Zomato and overall exp. so far has been amazing and great exp.,5
"1 star is also not for Zomato, 0 star is good",1
amazing quality and service is also very good,5
Value for Money Time saving and serves good attitude and yummy food,4
"nonsense service, no control on hotels, order cancelled without reason",1
It will not delivery in right time Waste app dont use use swiggy its better right time and fast delivery,1
"Awesome good,24 hours delivery 🚚 I like offer's,food,etc..",4
Not so useful in resolving post order issue.,1
thanks for zomato to provide me quick food delivery and safely. they give a good discount as well. thanks for your hardwork,5
I would have given a negative rating but that not possible. I ordered food worth 5k from Zomato and got it delivered late and due to that I was embarassed in front of my guest for the cold food. This is so unprofessional from Zomato.,1
Why there is no customer support from Zomato?It's damn irritating. How to contact you?should I use Twitter or what?You won't improve your service.Not even worth one star.,1
"Its great app but could be great if they allow cancelation of order with in a 5 minute window...it would have been great if we could schedule a lunch and dinner order to be delivered during busy times. I feel the mobile app is more intutive compared to the website. Some options may jot be available on website like chat session vut I could be wrong. Overall, I liked the app and grateful to have such tool around. I also request to add some resturant and their location.",4
"This is such a wonderful app my family enjoys alot, when my I am tired I just order from here",5
Always delay in delivery Other apps are far better,1
The employees sitting there do timepass when u ask them for help in regard to any of the order placed,1
Orders received too late service is so bad Swiggy is better than this .,2
Delivery of food on time and with the same hot food as we eat at restaurants Good experience,5
Packaging of some restaurant needs to improve overall zomato is a nice app,4
Worst support automatically amount was deducted but order was not accepted and my refund was not done when I ask for supporting team telling that we can't do anything 181 of my amount he claimed me 90 rupees,1
"I would like to suggest an upgrade to Zomato. Many times it has happened that the status displayed is ""Opens at 11 am"". But when it strikes 11, it suddenly changes to ""Currently not accepting orders"" & ""Opens next at 11am tomorrow."" Can there be an option by which we can be sure if a restaurant will definitely open or not? My planned schedule frequently gets disrupted because I cannot order from the only restaurant that my dad likes his meals from. Having tasted the best, we don't want to switch",4
"Poor!!!!! Delivery boy doesn't know how to talk and take more time then it shows ,poor co-ordination with the team of zomate and worst then that you could bring your food faster then the delivery boy.",1
Very safe and comfortable app for food delivery service 👍,5
"Trash service ,In the web it shows that you can apply coupon after downloading the app,but later on there is no offer in app, please stop making fool out the people.",1
"prices are exaggerated and customers are looted with high delivery charges and on top of this , even if the address is clear , we need to give instructions explaining for hours .such a horrible situation of the customers and zomato no where they take responaibility of restauranta, drivers and delivery quality. This should end and these people should come under any regulators and stringent rules should apply on this looters.",1
Tha app is very handy with easy to use foolprooffeatures. Cool experience even in hot summer,5
"Zomato Pro is useless. Delivery charges, parcel charges and such nonsense is still charged",1
"Zomato do good work,,but food quality is not very well",4
Items are missing in my order missing or incorrect my order please help 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 please help,1
"Very BAD experiences .... often the offers were not understandable.... Both customer & supplier were confused .... I placed an order of Egg Roll & the offer was ""Buy Two Egg Rolls & get One FREE"" ... we paid [₹2×45/- + delivery charges] for that order ... but got only Two Rolls ..did not get the Free one .... the supplier told us to place the order of 3 Rolls, then we get the free one ... The fraudulent activity was found observed ... if needed the screenshot of that offer may be provided ...",1
"Since last five times I have ordered from this app, I'm getting valets with rude behaviour. I don't know for what they have so much attitude ... Zomato, you have to resolve this problem or else you'll lose regular customers like me.",1
Perfect .......the delivery boy ... didn't have to call me ...up ......for location ... before time it reached ....very impressed ☺️,5
Such a bad app i wanted to change my order just increasing quantity of dal but here no customers support to slove this problem. And i want to cancel my order so they cancel my Cod option. This is my last order from your app,1
Very good options. Lilttle difficult to track order,4
Why minimum order?? I have added items worth 296 rs. But due to minimum order i.e 300 rs. I am not able to complete the order.,1
We ordered a cake on my brother birthday. They didn't delivered it and said that ur order is cancelled. We never cancelled the order. But still it was cancelled. And zomato dosent want to give back 1000/-Rs. The best part is we can call any one. They don't have costumer car. Pathetic service. They r talking on messenger and no solution for anything. The dilvery person called up and said i m in different location so i can't come and he spoiled my brother birthday. Very vary bad...,1
"After downloading, it was crashed.. Not opening Many times I uninstalled then reinstalled but same thing what should I do now?",3
"Great ,food delivery is fast",5
This is the best app for ordering food.,5
Very good clin and fast delivery,4
Awesome app for food delivery...,5
Very very fast service..... Quality food....,5
"Great app, handy in times of Corona",5
Please add coocking recipe videos in lockdown situations .,5
Nice and crct time delivery..... Safe also...,5
"Clumsy service they are not in time... they show time in their app starting order shall b delivered in next 11 minutes but it won't reach you even after half an hour pathetic service... request everyone to look for another app, zomato is money making company what ever we order online he zomato keeps their markup of min 20 to 100 rs or more + taxes as well people don't get cheated kindly ban this app #Banzomatobabgalore",1
I haven't received my order. Dominoz has issue at there side but no proper communication.,1
not delivery time and direct call me and wrong order butter scotch not item only other items so bad poor experience,1
Chat bot is worst and bug issue is there,1
"Stupid App. It can suspend any delivery boy just on the basis of customer complaint without any proper investigation. Took the saying too seriously ""Customer is always Right"" Why keep the option of COD at all and get into complications?? Take online payment in advance (reimburse if situation calls) and avoid all arguments between customer and delivery boy.",1
Good Service..But Fast food price.. very highest price,5
Nice Experience with Zomato for place Food order.and its eacy for users.,5
They won't listen to your complaints and will believe the restaurant even if you provide all the images as evidence. Worst service..,1
You people increased price of food That is totally different from the price restaurant offers. It's ridiculous.,1
Worst experience. Useless app. It doesn't have a tracking option. No matter how many times you send feedback. There are so many unhygienic restaurants which are reported by us. I have sent so many emails with invoice and food pictures that they were raw. Chicken had blood spots.. but there has been no action taken.,1
"They deliver orders from restaurants in which employees have been tested covid positive compromising the safety of customers. And when I cancelled order, they didn't issued me a refund",1
Third class app. I buy pro membership and i am not getting any special discounts in any orders. And the restaurants are always close from which i want to make order and the restaurant which has pro members discounts.and they shows great deals and offers in advertisements but in real they will takes extra charges and the final cost for any order remains same.,1
Stupid app..crashes after I order my food.,1
"When it says delivery time 30mins, it means you have to wait for 2hrs atleast 🤯",1
use less service worst app i have ever used chat support and customer support do not work at all,1
Good and fast delivery thank you,5
Excellent delivery and pretty fast mode of preparation.. thanks a lot 🙏,5
Very nice for those people who went regular out from home and also best for student who live in hostel,5
Rider location not working,1
Always on time with minimal calling,5
Very bad service. Promo code not working,1
Good service with many resturent and customer support,5
Costumer care phone number ber should be there to serve well he costumers regarding any issue.,2
"Support chat/ customer care doesn't not work. No way to get in touch with customer support service if received wrong order ,or if the order is late, cancel order when placed by mistake etc., their is no alternate to get some assistance when a customer needs it. Their is an option via email which means dragging the problem to several hours, max 48 hrs which could have been solved in a matter of minutes. No in-app support.",1
"West of time, bad service delivery is can't on time",1
Nice but a little simple design would be better,4
"So many bugs in the app. Got my delivery address wrong twice. The first order got cancelled, but got the second order delivered although I had to pay more for delivery. Why is the address not corresponding to the location shown to the delivery valet? It's a hassle both for the user and the valet.",1
Not giving a good services.i felt bad at last night.there executives and support team is trying to convince and closing the chat.just they need our money that's it.,1
It is very easy to use and fast response,5
Great service minimal fuss,5
Very high cost delivery charges I am not interested in this app very high cost Very very very very very very bad aap zomato,1
Very bad service.delivered below the level food items.,1
"On time and fast delivery, more offerss .. 😍",4
"On complaining about the issue about bad food experience and refund, they simply blocked my account. What an unprofessional behavior and heights of arrogance. I am sure they have the laws in their hands that's why braking customer rights and trust so easily.",1
Fast delivery 👌👌 But on zomato pizzas very costly,4
"Very poor customer service, system not even accepting feedback, if this is the way... I'd rather stop using zomato and find an alternative",1
Worst customer support. The response is pathetically slow and lazy.,1
Not resolving issues of customer...very poor service,1
They keep changing rules and condition. They don't deliver what they promise.. They change rules of pro always.. On time delivery timings they will adjust and finally the customer care treat their customer bad being rude and not providing a solution. If u can't provide what u have promised then why such promises? Most of the time I had bad experiences with food too.. But I adjusted and stayed just becos of the zomato pro membership.. Everything was good and better before but not now.,1
For me it is a satisfactory mobile restaurant service that I can enjoy by sitting under a single roof.,5
Very very poor in terms of refund and food as well . They are thieves and good for nothing. Swiggy is much better . They cheated on me sent me wrong order and then did not even refund back.,1
Great experience whenever i took order from this zomato app,5
Totally fake app. Charging more then original restaurant menu.,1
Poor service. Delivery charges are very high.,1
It is better than swiggy. But not too much good so 4 star.,4
"Hello , I have been using zomato from last 2years i have ordered 100s of times , But never ever reported any misbehavior from any of your delivery boys, till not and never i think so i will face any.. Just want to request u guyz to pass on my suggestion to whom so ever it concern .. We are in a mordern india and i believe so that everyone is well aware how to react with the situation as per me every delivery boy know they are on third party contract and they are well aware about the consiq",5
Only the promo code is used 1 time so I gave 2 stars and food is very costly and we have pay taxes 50-60 rupees,2
It was not good no proper quality as I received stone from the food I ordered and got a chicken peice in egg biriyani,1
Good service & fast,5
"Really bad expeirence with zomato delivery even customer care experience is terrible..not recommended, better to use other delivery partners/apps",1
Poor delivery. Most of the time wallet has no idea of locations. They are rude too,1
The food delivered cold.. infact not used the container to remain the temperature as others,3
Smart deliveries. Enjoyment always. Thank you Zomato.,5
"Coupons , offers and codes Thank you Zomato and Team",5
Good service but a bit late service...,3
Good food and quality assurance,5
Nice app but only in big city it will be better not in small towns,4
"customer support sucks and, sometimes they take hours to deliver.",4
really worst experience with Zomato. am waiting for order near 2hours. there no response nd all.,4
I am loving this app alot and safety features are good,5
The money for my missing order was not get refunded even though i dropped so many emails to customer care.,1
"Very Worst Service, My Order Was 2 Hours Late Still THey Did Not Refund My Money, And Order Also Not Delivered, I Will Use ZoMato Again, Swiggy Is Best",1
Awesome delivery and awesome food,5
Very good and fast.. food delivery service ..,5
I didn't receive my refund even 3 days already passed away.... why they are so late in refunding,1
Worst app. It increases its prices at night when its peak time for orders and puts the minimum order limit which is very high! How can a single person order more than his limits due to the minimum order limit!? Veryyy annoying!,1
Delivery chargesare high and offers are tooo less as compare to other applications,3
Nice app and fast delivery,5
Very late delivery . Fix responsibility to the delivery team .,1
"Best app, instant delivery",5
Zomato food is very bad.and if you complain regrading your food to them on food they served they don't pay any attention towards your complaint.so guys if you want to waste your money then order from zomato.. today i experience such bad food that no one can eat i order fried rice and paneer Paratha from zomato..in rice i found hair in it and paratha doesn't look its paneer Paratha it give you taste of simple Paratha..,1
Whenever there is bad quality food delivered the support executives go to great length to defend the restaurant. It's not all customer friendly.,2
super tasty and low price and more quantity,5
Everything is all correct just we need discount offers!,5
"App works fine and this review is not for app but for Zomato. Delivery services are one of the worse, do not order looking at the commitment. Quality of food delivered is bad most of the times and food gets damaged also. Biggest problem is the price by Zomato. If you are ordering from your regular restaurant you will observe a price surge of 2 time or maybe more on products. Earlier I used Zomato alot but it comes only as an emergency option. Avoid using Zomato to break the monopoly.",1
Good Interface. Valet are good.,5
Good but should be offering more discount in today's competitive market,4
Every time my order is late....unsatisfied...still I rate 4-5 but now it is ridiculous 😒,1
"Very nice app,don't have to go around snooping in websites....",5
Very cheap and good quality,5
Every time I have to explain adress to your delivery boys. It seems you don't share correct adress as mentioned in my profile. V bad experience almost every delivery,2
"They are not taken a reasonable price, food cost is too heavy",1
Fastest delivery and thy follow all the instructions wht ever we hve mention good keep going,5
Zomato is very reasonable compared to swiggy only taxes and delivery is 100rup extra....keep bringing offers zomato love ur app...,5
"Very bad communication and so late order. will never order from zomato AGAIN, I will delete the APP.",1
Excellent app for ordering food online.,5
Best app 10 min delivered awesome👏😊👍,5
Zomato delivery guys are delivering multiple orders at a time. Bcoz which they are delivering it late,1
"Zomato pro is now worthless. Everytime there is delivery surge and price hikes. In 2021 , they are now just looting people by adding taxes and unnecessary delivery surge and all. Further no good pro offers now. In short , zomato pro is now just wastage of money.",1
Charges highly for delivery.,1
Very poor app not user friendly. Not let you choose rather force user to choose. Hide offers at the time of payment instead must prompt for opting discount offer. Doesn't show tracking of delivery. Overall a basic app. Don't know who is wasting billions???,2
Don't use your coupon code to place the order If you do then my friend the quality and the quantity of food will be very bad trust me.,1
Good service just like mother give her baby to food,5
"Good app to use, nice interface.",5
Zomato is better than any other food delivery... Zomato se order kiya kya ...!¡!,4
Domino's shop just 200-300 meter away from delivery location still showing 53 rs deliver charges in zomato app,2
Fast delivery and ontime delivery experience.,5
It's unbelievable how there is no more zomato chat because you don't want to deal with order issues. Disgusting.,1
Zomato is always good during our hungry cravings. Cheers,5
Good app and easy to use 👍👍👍,3
Costumer executive are responding properly. Waste of money,4
"Zomato takes extra efforts for delivery of the order is on COD, if the order is paid in advance their delivery agents simply hang the phone if there is a location mismatch. They take the parcel home instead of delivering it back to restaurant. I'm going to uninstall Zomato, it takes balls to give that extra customer enrichment. Three orders one on Swiggy and twi on Zomato, Swiggy person delivered even though address was wrong, that too full amount paid in advance.",1
"Unhappy with Zomato delivery strategy, instead of delivering direct as hot serve Zomato clubbed multiple order causing delay & not allowing hot serve.",2
"Service, delivery has declined in quality.",1
"very late delivery, though I am a pro member I have issues with refund and customer service.",1
Too good I'm so happy with join zomato.... Really all time accept my order at list 11pm thanks for supporting us .. I give five start ...... So guys definitely download this app without hesitate and order now.....😘😘😘,5
awesome tasty and healthy food. subscriptions too available,5
Every time by today zomato gave excellent service. Thank you Team Zomato.,5
"It's very bad experience from Zomato, Ordered food delivery guy didn't call us also ,he delivered to someone else.after that when we called him , behaved very rudely, When we raise request to customer care , it's very bad response I got from Zomato. Just they will say sorry,even they will not do anything. It's worst experience from Zomato",1
Worst app ever I ordered from Zomato and got the non veg food instead of veg I m a pure vegetarian I don't even touch non veg and I ate a bite because of there mistake that caused me vomitting so many times when I complained they even cared about customer they asked me to write on restaurants page this is the solution they gave me! Like seriously? I hate this app zero customer service.,1
If u give complaint against hotel..just they(Zomato) you are trying to console us in chatting. No refund or replacement has been done to me .,3
Super application because cash on delivery accept Zomato best compare to swigy,4
These are theif they provide road side cheap quality food.. please ingore these type of application,1
Late order everytime and high delivery charges,1
Good app with wide range of food resturants,5
Assigning multiple deliveries resulting in huge delay in orders.,2
Far better from old one good service and timely issue solving tactics I appreciate God bless u,5
Very nice and quick facility happy and satisfied 😊😊😊,5
It's my first time using it but I already love it so much and the delivery was very friendly and so sweet to me. I love it😍😍,5
Swiggy is better than Zomato. Have had multiple late deliveries with Zomato.,1
Good quality and test 👍,4
Zomato won't take complaint seriously at all I have give complaint about food which have burned totally and I sent the pic also but still didn't response..,1
Promo code details are not mentioned properly I lost my money.. Customer care is not working good delay for reply,1
Thank u sooooo muchhhhhh Zomato app Very fast delivery man's 🥺 thank a alot super heros 🥺,5
Very High delivery charge and taxes iam disappointed that.,1
"Increase your range , all online services present at my location but zomato is not there pin 283101 and its too much expensive food now a days , no discount. One person food rates are high about 200 ruppes 🙄🙄. Delivery charges ,taxes are increasing the actual price of products. Either we have to order directly from restaurants.",2
"Delivers food before time , excellent service !!!!!!",5
"It doesn't able to get one *even No option to cance the order. And badness of support option available in app, one cannot describe that bad. Too poor. please take your issue from here, when I will find function availqble in the App I will update the review. also make your support chat-boot more interactive and functional. thanks",1
timely service and fresh food with delicious taste 😇,5
Food quality not checking properly,1
Very fast and excellent service 🤩,5
Very fast delivery..superb keep serving,5
"Waste service, don't order the food in this app they wasted customers money nd time..",1
So now randomly no coupons are visible / applicable on any resturant in my ID whereas when I checked the accounts of my brother and my friend various coupons are available to them on those very same restuarants. This is the kind of equality principles Zomato follows. Also this is coming from a person who orders 10-15 times a month. Thankyou so much for terrible treatment ZOMATO !,1
Fast delivery & good response mainly yummy food,5
Completely Satisfied with the overall service.,5
Good but delivery charges are very high we are paying tip to delivery boy also,3
convenient way of eating healthy foods and stress free kitchen,5
"Whenever I ordered the food,,it was hot always,,,I was enjoyed the food,, I'm happy with Zomato....Thank you for ur services",5
This application is started by jagga daku A application full of errors. And delivery charges are for looting people. I order almost 3 times less to this lootera people. And level of loot is Increasing day by day. Soon I will delete this lootera application.,1
Good food and taste.. but the delivery man was rude..not like he shouted at me .... But the way he talk to me.. so disrespectful...other than that great app.,3
Extremely satisfied with all your services. 🙂🙂,5
"I always order from u guys and the service and how good u guys keep it not spilling the drinks is amazing, love you guys and keep up doing what you are doing ❤",5
Well organised and reliable.,4
Horrible food not reaching in time Tremendous delay,1
I think Zomato is best app for delicious food at ur door step with best best price ..,5
The food was ordered in more than 70 seventy minutes and delivery person and online assistance was telling totally lieing and order food was tasteless and survey cold loosy and stuffy order,1
While clicking on view cart something went wrong message is displaying,1
Delivery charges are increasing every month like fuel prices.,1
Please mention the delivery man rating And quickly delivery at home,3
"Delivery time is perfect, No issue",5
Nice app good food quality Amazing app Very good items . .,5
They don't respond to issues n that too issues like food poisonings. They keep saying we are transferring the issue to other agent.,4
Nice service and awesome app.,5
"Cheating cheating cheating Very worst app. Always deceives the customers in the name of discount. But never deliver the ordered food with all accompaniments,, quantity delivered Will be reduced quantity compared to regular quantity when go buy from hotel. I have faced so times different problems like (1) non- delivery of ordered items. (2) delivery of reduced quantity of ordered food. (3) delivery of stale food. (4) customer Support executives are thieves, never fulfill the promise.",1
The app is very useful and helpful in this pandemic situation Thanks to Zomato,5
I'm able to order food for my family from overseas as well 😋...loved it Thank you Zomato from Canada 🇨🇦 🇮🇳,5
Not Satisfied with the order and getting worst food,1
Very fast delivery n very reasonable prices 😊😊😊😍😍😍,5

"Very bad service 😡 I'm ordered one half chiken tandoori from , Lulu Family restuarant , Bangalore kr Puram , and here showing Zomato boy name , S ganagaraja ,1 hours done not yet delivered and showing in online delivered 😡😡 than where is my order , I think ZOMATO is good but , seriously I'm telling my order not delivered , and everyone one telling delivered , everyone one cheaters here , don't buy anything from ZOMATO 😡",1
Customer friendly service and good gesture by delivery executive,5
The best app for food delivery I have came accross,5
Quality is good and amount also less,5
"My food not delivered, and my money also not refunded it's 7 days gone but not respond from your side, I think your all staff is busy in current case of woman hitting on her nose,,,,, it's so irritating",1
I am using this app since years. But now it's getting expensive to order from zomato because: 1. Delivery charges are sometimes high(usually everytime) 2. The rates are hiked up on the app than the original rate of the food item. For example 1 aloo patties costs 30 on the app but actually it is of 15 on the shop. WHAT IS THIS!!!!!,3
Overall good experience with food but please support kamaraj he is innocent bring him back ..,4
Worst service.and price is high.no response by the agents,1
Very user friendly and convenient,5
"Money is lost if they deliver the wrong order, they will not replace or return the money as simply give some excuse that they don't have any policy, which is against the law.",1
It's really helpful when I am not in good health to cook.,5
"What a nice app, order food n get it quick",4
It's not good can't connect to customer can't complaint about anything I think I should start using swiggy,1
Good app to user satisfaction and get the best of all the time 🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠,4
Always late with deliveries and worst at solving queries.,1
Don't install this app Zomato wale 3 4 order sahi se karte hai phir cheat karna chalu kar dete hai. Mostly online payment me. Swiggy is 100 better than Zomato.,1
"Good APK and also Good service, overall good experience",5
All the timing is not ticking in final minutes,1
Good but delivery time is so late in recent days,4
Thank you keeping near to food they like.,5
"Ordering from slums and unchecked areas, MAX SAFETY, thats excellent. Can you please describe your max safety standards because i have a whole recording to chalenge your claims.",1
Good .. satisfied with food delivery but some boys not coming sure place,5
"Thanks for the delivery, the app is very user friendly!",5
"I use only zomato as an online food order app and i like ur service very much... But i really don't like now for suspending kamaraj without knowing the truth... I will not use this app until kamaraj getting rehired, If not i will uninstall this app...",1
Ordered food from mojjo pizza using Zomato. Item was not delivered. Phone no. of outlet provided by Zomato was wrong. No customer support from Zomato. Don't know where to go.,1
biriyani tastes good I ordered for family function and also I had been there startes are good flavoured and awesome tastes,5
I am in Bangalore and I hate Zomato here. So overpriced. And incidents are happening because Zomato service team never gives refund. Even if it is 1 hour late. They doesn't know the concept of refund.,1
"Very nice app, I am very thankful to zomato",5
We raised complaint and try to add picture it's been loading.,1
"Everything fine, but customer service not good. I can't see the picture of all the item availabe in a restaurant. Also there are some restaurants whose phone number are either switched off or they don't answer. So zomato should keep themselves updated with the restaurants. Also, offer some discounts.",3
Inaccurate and changing delivery time.,2
I was the regular customer but zomato did not provide delivery without any legel or logical reason..,4
incomplete order was delivered. contacted helpline they were unable to connect with restaurant. I tried explaining them that I work at a ruraral place where I don't have Zomato service so I won't be able to avail the promo cash coupon but they were adamant on there protocol. also I agreed to it. I again tried placing an order using the promo code but because of some issue it got cancelled and the Zomato says I won't be able to avail it for next 2-4 hours.. And after 2-4hours It will be of no use,1
"Best app in food delivery dept, with awsome service",5
It's a worst app. If u cancel 1 tym COD then there will b no allowance to order again on COD. I gave them a valid reason for canceling then also its not allowing me for COD.,1
"Very fast delivery app,good food",5
Good. Some restaurants missing plates. If provided the same highly appreciated.,4
"These clowns cancelled my order at a time when all the restaurants in the city were closed. After that they refused to refund my money and told me to wait for 5-7 working days. And if anything was left , they sent a clown associate named sandeepkaur(jindal) to resolve this issue. That associate can't even speak basic English and was repeating the same thing again and again. They denied me my dinner and they robbed my money too. Absolutely ridiculous",1
Superfast service.. safe delivery,5
Good app easy to order food,4
Very bad experience.They are not even giving reply on support... We get helpless by ordering on zomato,1
Charging very high delivery charges and taxes,2
This is a best and fastest Order Delivery apps,5
Worst service...The delivery guy came and didn't called up cancelled the order and did not refund the amt,1
Oder we are getting on time facility is good zomato is a good app to order any food,4
"Put me in a embarrassing situation with guests...i ordered food but half of it was missing, they offered my refund for half but i do i serve my guests and over that they didn't even try to help me but with fake apologies they told me that they cannot help me....how can anyone ever rely on this app again if i could i would have given zero stars...but u can't do that...",1
Well most of the time offer code is not working,4
Nice app fast delievery excatly frm same restaurant where u want an delivery boys behaviour is good polite an peaceful,5
How do I submit a valet rating when the submit option from the top right has disappeared?,4
For the recent updates as it's not showing many options like meal for one and many other for easy links. Even talked with the customer service but they also don't know and asking me to share the screen shot over the chat. They even don't know we cannot share the screen shot in chat. Kindly resolve the issue or I will uninstall the app it's became useless now. I have done this post on in months of December 2020 but no response by anyone. In my application no offer showing or quick links.,1
My firat ever order with zomato and it was missing 1 item on chat with customer care for more than 30 mins...the associate last respondes to my message 24 mins back and since then they have stoppe responding to my messages,1
Extremely unhappy with the delivery charges increasing day by day.,2
"Refund policy very bad, received wrong order!!",1
Great offers satisfied with discount 🙂,5
Bad experience in Zomato app it show free term but not diliver and not shown in Bill also but show in app.,1
In every restaurant they add SURGE charges.. Its fake... No demand hotels are not take surge charges.. But zomato takes all restaurant to surge charges,3
didn't get the proper order and the delivery guy is not responding our call really disappointed,1
Very worst experience... customer service is not responding..the restaurant and the customer care centre both are falthus.better to avoid the zomato... they steal our money...,1
One of the best services out there and was a blessing during lockdown and COVID.,5
Zomoto service was very worst service in my life... after 4:30 pm service was very late and Irresponsible delivery person and zomoto executive also....,1
"Delivery team is always good. But your business strategy is joke . Why, because when ever I try to order something from zomato, it always shows minum order amount like 250 required for a particular restaurant to complete the payment. But same restaurant in other app is not showing any limitation and I able to order for low amount that zomato showing as minimum order delivery . Then how will I use your app . 😀",2
"Their delivery executives actually are very rude and talks very badly. And when you raise a complaint in their customer care, they give you Rs 30 zomato credit. 30 rs is the cost according to zomato for their executive misbehaving with you. I wish playstore had minus ratings as zomato does not even deserve one star",1
Food delivered r not what we order on app and CX care still says it was correct n will serve u better in future.,1
It's the bestest app for foodies as I am also a foodie so I loved it.....☺️🥰🥰🥰🤗🤗🤗🤭🤭,5
Very good service and excellent performance,5
Good and fast delivery.,4
Useless customer support service even after giving continuous complaints they won't respond and our money get wasted,1
"Eat whenever, wherever what ever time you want... you just have to order and food comes directly to your doorsteps",5
Good experience and delivered on time....happy customer 👌,5
Worst app to give orders even after payment debited wont get delivery at promised time,1
No response for food quality & money back report,1
I usually don't write reviews but there Zomato delivery guy was covid positive and they are say they can tell he is fine by his voice I mean government is stupid that they are spending money on covid test they should listen people's voice and tell if he has corona or not I was in my house for 15 days I didn't even went outside but I ordered food at 21 April 2021 at 9:30pm and I got sick at 1 am 22 April 2021 I was healthy before that then today 23 April 2021 I took covid test and I found +,1
Worst experience with this app....there is no option to cancel the order....they r playing with our money and time... stupid app... unfortunately we made a mistake in our order so we are trying to cancel the order by chating with coustomer care there is no proper method to cancelling order.. they replying same questions repeatedly....finally they would not cancel order... Worst worst worst app comparing with other apps.....PLZZ don't install and use this app...i am giving negative ⭐ ⭐⭐⭐⭐......,1
Absolutely no responsibility after an order is placed. The delivery time won't update even though actual time has already passed. Chat support is always slow and nothing shows up after even selecting pre programmed texts all just to fool the customer. Avoid ordering and get the meal yourself that way you can have it in time and fresh.,1
Great food with great ambience.. would like to say thanks from the bottom of my heart .. thanx Tarang for yummy food...,5
Received a call to confirm address after one hour of making order. 👎👎👎,1
This is beautiful amazing app delivery is very quick thank you zomato,5
It's an good app but always update are coming with in two days,1
Good but....no cancelation available in case of emergency,4
"Very good , timing + protection with safety",5
"Good bye Zomato. Was not really a good experience with the food delivery system although the choice of restaurants available was good. Had repeated issues with person handling/delivering the food. May be it is because of the location of my home at 3rd floor in an apartment with no lift. And perhaps I had not opted for online tip and thought of showing the gratitude personally with little extra, which I usually prefer for all such food del, as they have to climb extra stairs to deliver the food.",1
Worst app unable to place order showing try again after wasting 30 minutes now i am going to place order from swiggy thanks zomato for wasting my time,1
I wish there was some headroom for canceling the order. The moment I place the order I am given only a fraction of a second to cancel it. And even though I cancel it under a minute I have to pay cancelation charges. BTW the only way to resolve this is adding some time for canceling orders. 30secs will also do,2
Very late delivery and food was cold n stale,1
"Hi Team, Wanted to check if you have the below feature available in your app? If not, I guess it would be great if you can come with one. If i wanted to gift a friend a discount coupon for XXXX.Rs which is valid for a specific period. Is this possible through your app ?",5
Very good service and userfriendly application,5
I'm using zomato last long time always best SERVICES and Delivery person all are good,5
Very good quality and quantity 👌 really,5
The customer care Service is very superb..,5
Timeing is good but food is not good pizza is very bad and manchuriyan is tooo solty and rice is also bad,1
Good Service .. quick resolution,5
Service is very nice & must important safe,5
Worst app.... wrong food delivered and no response for exectives....no support.....after my review ..Zomato enquiry is saying apologie...bt they are not resolving problem,1
Food Has not reached but the delivery guy says he is there,1
I like and easy way for my order. Thank u,5
In my location there s no rain but still you are charging rs 40 extra as surcharge. Looting people's,1
"Very Good app, and fast serive , I like this app very much",5
Very slow service taking long time to delivered not very fast service like swiggy,1
Very best food delivery app 👌 for me,5
I ordered 8 inch pizza but it sent me 6 inch pizza and take full money of 8 inch pizza it is waste app don't order anything from it.,1
It service is very slow and mostly get cold food,1
Delivery man behavior is very bed Stop listing nonveg Zomato open means nonveg page comes up. Keep the nonveg sheet separate. And not even the nonveg mark. The app will not run in Hindustan,1
Have had issues with every single delivery from zomato.,1
The very important point is that the Order reaches on time at night also...,5
"Hopeless, just frauds looters they tell you to be a pro member and you will get offers and discounts all fake inspite of paying Rs 200 there is no pro membership and orders are all missing always they dont complete the orders in one go and then ask for apologies and say we will refund the amount which they never do. Ridiculous. This services should be stopped immediately.",1
"Hygenic, delivers on time, great offers, delicious food and thats all I need.",5
Good service and options for foods from our favaroite restaurants on discounted prices..,5
Great help during the covid lockdown time.,5
It's working very good in delivering for food.,5
"Terrible service! That's what i can say. After zomato closed the service, my membership refund still not finished and it keeps asking me the bank account for the refund even after i input it. Almost 3 months and still not receive any refund till now. Terrible customer service, not even help at all!!! Worst app! If the team looks at my review, don't ever asked me to give any bank information AGAIN! I've just put it through your typeform !!",1
Worst experience ever it took 1 hour to deliver and that to half order only and they said it was cancelled by us and no payment refund nothing atkeast swiggy is better then this,1
Best food ordering app. No one can beat it!! Not even swiggy😋,5
Simple and serene ambience . Amazing food,5
Very nice app for quick and fast food selection cum delivery,5
"1. Riders are coming without helmet and hence not allowed inside the colony. Says company doesnt care about their safety. 2. Riders are complaining zomato charges them for their bag. 3. Riders are complaining zomato is not providing them mask. 4. Overall, my experience with zomato is getting detoriated due to constant rider complaints and food delivery delays.",1
It's good but please give more options for coupon 😉,5
"Very bad customer service, didn't even bother to address the issue after 3 days",1
Always takes restaurant charge greater than ordered values...,1
Excellent Service and offers,5
Very good approach and having a nice patience with customers thank you Zomato Team,5
Prices for the food is less compared to other food apps,5
Its really very rediculous whenever i have placed my order with pasta town there is some or the other issue with my order. I ordered for paneer pizza today and i received mushroom and there was not even a single piece of paneer cheese was sticked to the box there was no cheese on pizza left. The serving is really not appropriate. I want my refund of the whole amount . Make sure i get it done,1
"Very bad service , order is not received and order is showing deleiverd.",1
wow very good & tasty food also reasonable price,5
Being a swiggy customer..Had a horrible first experience. COD was not available...dilevery was 15 minute late ...food packaging was bad...not a single thing to appreciate!,1
"Worst custmer support service, taking high charges and also worst discounts were provided. First your app shows high food rate then your app apply tax and other charges and after that for 30 % discount you deduct only 15%.",2
"Great experience in all terms, polite staff, on time delivery. One suggestion : Zomato can use this platform to promote importance of education by additional incentive to students who do partime job of delivering food to meet expenses of their studies. It can also be done by adding word STUDENT beside name of delivery person so that customers know about the delivery person and can add tips to support such students.",5
Delivery charges is very high,1
Very good app . I am very much satisfied with this app .😊😇,5
Slow delivery Not within time limits. I.e in 30 minutes,1
these guys become unique players and doing all no scene things I wish few more food delivery apps need to start then this guys will be in track,1
"Very poor service, order was delivered to late",1
Quick delivery and satisfactory service,5
I just purchase a code from fk once i applied code it show discount but when i proced to next the app does't work that's why i again applied it show you can't use this code,1
Very bad tat it din give payment option. It takes COD automatically.,1
Always better offers through zomato. Good job :),5
I have a very bad experience with the driver and most of the time the food will be mixed 😂 As a bug company you need to do training for your drivers and teach them that he is deliverung a fiod not he is in a race,1
"Very bad experience with zomato and customer service. They are looting people without providing proper resolution.. If we people don't buy food from this worst app, they will got a lesson and they will not loot people.. Thief's are better than you zomato people. Disgusting",1
Just because I am not taking pro membership since last few order facing issue regarding longer time to get the order delivered though order placed at nearest restaurants. Are we bound to take the membership?,2
"Zomato Policy - one delivery agent multiple orders - end result customers left waiting when they are hungry and also served good which is not hot. We never had this issue earlier. But it's become very prevelant, wherein even if order from nearby restaurant, the food comes in late. Secondly some of your cust rep are pathetic. They refused to respond beyond a certain point. Scripted matter of fact answers. Need to be more humane",1
"It has a poor grievance redressal system. Every complaint has automated responses without any actual solution. On one occasion, when I complained about a restaurant, I was conveniently advised to choose another restaurant. Simple.",1
Yummy food and safe and hygienic packaging.,5
Very fast delivery and the offer also be there 😀,4
They approve the order then the restaurant call to say we don't deliver to your area and there is no specific place to add comments for each order,2
"Zomato's service is really very bad. Actually, fraud is going on in Zomato. I placed an order on Thursday (March 18, 2021). Address in app is correct but delivery boy told me he reached other place which ia far from my residence. I made payment online while booking. My order got canceled. I didn't get food and reimbursement. What a way to make money and cheat people taking undue advantage of lockdown.",1
High delivery charges and rates quoted are higher than normal rates. Also after gold was converted to pro the one plus one option was reduced to extra 30% off so the discounts have reduced. App charged rs 30 distance fee for restaurant merely 1 km from home,1
Delivery person always having multiple delivery and my food will be cool always till it is delivered,2
"Taking much large amount of money than restaurant rate. Better go to restaurant and purchase directly from there, will cost u 10 to 20 rupees of petrol, Much cheaper than zomato brokerage. .",1
Fast and best service,4
great & easy to order,5
Very very poor service Everytime just cancelled delivery cancelled delivery very poor same on your zomoto stap,1
"Food not received , it's showing delivered fake app don't use this application",1
very good application for ordering food online from your favourite restaurants and cafes,5
In last 10 days this is second time that i paid for my order online order got cancelled by zomato's issue second time and i havent recived any refund till now i think these guys are willingly doing all this stuff to use our money for a longer period.,1
This app is so bad because there is no available this service cash on delivery,1
They will say oder will be on and if not money will be returned but never it will be on time and they never ever cashback,1
Horrible customer service experience. They accept that they have screwed up. And yet their solution is just an apology. Come on Zomato. You can do better than this. Apology backed up with no solution?,1
"Customer service not up to the mark, and didnt receive the refund yet.",1
Fast service & good product,4
"Very good & good presentation,,,, ❤❤thankuuu so much",5
Zomato is charging delivery charges more than the item which we order...This is really too much we need shell out 60 to 70rs delivery charges plus restaurant service charges of 20rs ....we can order one more item with this amount or else we can go and buy from resturant instead of paying this amount to Zomato...Swiggy is far better...This is customer dissatisfaction and you will start losing customers soon...,1
The best version of online ordering app and a company which also provide good services even ordering on zomato saves money 😄,5
Not bad👍 Gifting option is not working properly,3
Lot of options for food,5
Really enjoyed ordering food from Zomato and being their Pro member has also given additional benefits to me. Thanks for your service keep it up.,5
Zomato mein Delivery thora late hota hai...as compare to swiggy But Nice application for online food,4
fake totally fake application in shop the item price is 90 and on Zomato it's 160 wow great,1
Customer care support concern was extremely impatient and rude.,1
Very fast and safe delivery....i loved it 😍,5
This is so embracing to write this review but female zomato users should know about it & I want zomato to take early action against the delivery boy Nizam Khan who was intentionally delaying in the midnight to deliver my food being 4 minutes away.I called him to guide but he requested me to whatsapp him my location as he was unable to trace it. I did & after that he disappeared & switched off his mobile marking delivered. Zomato needs to make sure that he won't misuse my address in far future.,1
Standard reply to all problems. Need to be customer centric approach.,2
Nice app and service I am so happy with this app,5
Extremely dissatisfied and disappointed with the service that the app has been providing recently.,1
They keep delivering wrong orders and then just waste your time through chat.,1
Good food & delivery on time,5
I am facing address problem 2 time. And when I decide to talk to support they said this is your problem. They dont want to lesson my problem. Worst support team,1
Quick delivery and valets wel behaved manners are most appreciated,5
Food will be delivered on correct time,5
"An amazing app, far ahead of its competition and a great user experience. Two suggestions: 1) add a cancel food option, where if someone orders they have the option to cancel it in one minute, 2) provide a halal option-- just like egg and veg if you can also mention if the eatery provides halal cuisine it would be versatile for customers.",5
Quick and safe delivery i loved this app compare to swiggy,5
Delivery boy was well behaved Delivery in time,5
Great service it's like the trusted to order in it .Go for it.....🥰🥰,5
Allow users to upload photos from the gallery instead of taking a live pic while reporting complaints with the food. We can't wait hungrily with the food to take a pic until we get connected with your support team. Also many times it takes a few minutes to get the delivery confirmation notification after the delivery partner has actually delivered the parcel and left the place.,3
Now a days delivery late and making food unnecessary expensive,1
Such a faltu app.deliver the food item in 30 min late and the food was also cold . disgusting,1
Good food and good beheber for bayera,5
Very bad servuce from his side it will take 1hrs for delevery time &the location was just 5minutes walking distnce,1
Delivery charges are very High.,3
"Worst last time I was order food restaurant name is different, I receive a food from different Restaurant. But the cost is high don't cheat people's.",1
I Give zero star if it is possible. Very bad service.I have mail two to three times but no response from your side...very bad Experience..👎👎,1
After update my mobile is not able to request any order this is too bad.,1
Worst food service app. Converted gold membership to pro. And it's useless. Not recommended to order food too. Looters & Cheaters.,1
Work service delivery boy just to complete his target carry 2 order at a time both of opposite direction Not able to see live location of my order will rate 00000000 and this will be my last order with Zomato,1
Very good online food delivery...,5
Nice experience and great discount,5
Lovely dishes and fast delivery,5
Very nice.. The most lovely things are offers,5
Good Offers and Good Food that's what everyone 😋 wants ❤💙,5
"New customers are given better treatment than older customers. Today I again faced problem with my order. I complained about it but solution wasn't to my satisfaction. First thing I did was I uninstalled the app. Those who want good food delivery, just tie up with your favourite restaurant. If u will b a frequent customer and develop good relation with the restaurant, u will get your desired order everytime to your satisfaction. U may not get huge discounts but at least u won't end up cooking",1
Very worst app delivery boy taken our customer orders and mobile switch off dont try to any order in that app because very worst behaviour,1
On time delivery and excellent staffs,5
Timing of delivery is so good in 30 min only,4
"Excellent food,every dish is like home made. We enjoyed food alot.",5
Love Zomato and its features. And their service is better than Swiggy's.,5
I Really Enjoying the zomato delivery app and food.,4
Very fast delivery and i am very impressed with zimato Thank you Zomato,5
Too good and fast delivery,5
Pathetic service.......Cake Brought in a smashed up condition.....when they know that........Extremely Upset,1
"Fast and tasty food delivery app, I like it😊",5
cannot chat and say an addon was missing,3
Delivery boy is very cooperative and pizza is also good,5
Worst service!! Frauds!! Suggest never order from this app. I ordered this but delivery boy not delivery food and confirm that he delivered.,1
Online rate is high compare to the hotel price list .,1
"Delivery charges are not affordable at all, they are too much to pay for any food item. Whole mood changes when i see almost ₹50 delivery charges, and sometimes i didn't order bcz of same reason",1
"not good, these days upon complaint they ask us to mail and wait for 2 days for solution, after waiting they dehct customer complaints by not trusting them, so switched over to other appps, plz dnt go for zomatoo",1
Good service but according to market rate cost higher,5
A very good food delivery app.,5
"They cheat their customers! Poor quality food delivered, unacceptable and not possible to eat. Got no solution/compensation for the issue.",1
Zomato App's clock is different...3 min is equivalent to 15 mins IST,5
"I did a order repeat of my 29.01.2021 order and u can very well check that the order which was placed on 29 was different from what i received. Also i had ordered the same dish at around 9.30 pm today which was spilled amd non eatable and i had to cancel the same. The customer care people are rude and doesn't cate about customers. Jasleen from your customer support team. Rude , very rude. Zero stars.",1
I like the offers it's much beneficial for me.... And hope the same for all... And no words for taste it's delicious,5
Fast delivery and best offer,5
Start essential products and grocery delivery again,4
"Excellent App.... 4 stars only as the Location for delivery cannot be changed by moving any Pin position on map.... Desperately need this feature as this leads to difficulties for delivery agents often.... Dear team Zomato, please implement this feature.... [updated on 11-6-19] With the latest updates, the above features are available now.... Thanks team Zomato.... updated the rating...",5
Fast and safely delivered the item,5
On-time delivery feature is very Good,5
Speedy delivery with all safety precautions due to covid situation. Preferable,5
great food in an lovely setting,5
My experience was very bad... My order was not at right location and they cancel my order. My amount is used as cancellation fee. I will suggest never use zomato... Even they don't provide customer care helpline.,1
"Probably the only mainstream app still not accepting cash on delivery. When got in touch with the customer care on Twitter they were totally unhelpful. I was told that cod will be activated after few ""successive"" prepaid orders. Where infact I've already made several prepaid orders since December.",2
I install Zomato because of I have only cash payment but later it shows cash on delivery not available,1
Fast delivery and good job,4
"Customer Support is very bad, No action on restaurant and they want to satisfy customer by providing refund of 50% of total amount.",1
nice service and good quantity,5
Never order food through Zomato they don't even care about your money if you have any issue if u get spoilt food or missing items they don't respond just they say it's not out fault you can review the hotel Directly such a disappointment,1
"Worst service, chat doesn't connect to agent. Zomato make customers fools.",1
Out of the world Awesome food from Zomato decent delivery man very humble and polite,5
Very good service 👌 I am extremely satisfied with the app Only cod is not available for me Please do enable cod Thank you. ..........ZOMATO,3
Availability any time available good source for online delivery many existing offers and easy refundable,5
"Nice app ,especially for late night foodie like me.",5
Cost is more than other delivery apps and delivery is too late,3
"Zomato has a deluge of adverts, promotional offers, PR tactics with scrumptious dishes and foods. But the one time you're relying on them they will surely 'betray' (and I have not used that word lightly) you like anything. They have absolutely no contingency plans whatsoever, it's raining over here and zomato had cut off it's delivery. I too come from an operations background and we have plan to provide service in dire conditions. But apparently, the revenues at zomato are too good for that.",1
"Its better to order in swiggy because zomoto is not responding on issues nd it kills customers patiency,go and order in swiggy more customer friendly nd zomoto executives are really waste guys.",2
Horrible experience. I get an incorrect order of horrible quality and you guys cannot even bother to reply or intiate a refund. So done .,1
Delivery 🚚 was before time. Good job during this pandemic. Keep going. Good Luck.,5
Awesome delivered....the speed of delivery is just awesome...I am zapped ...Kudos to your delivery team...,5
"a few days, the Zomato representative should call you back for paperwork. You will also be assigned a Point of Contact (POC) when you go live. In case you get stuck somewhere, you can reach out to your POC or email to restaurants",5
Great App for fulfilling your periodical cravings :),5
Good food at best quality Awesome service Customer care support is also good,5
Fast delivery and taste food,4
Good service all delivery and satisfy,5
"Item wrong delivered and no any type refund, bad service",1
Fast and quick delivery while you feel hungry...just try Zomato 😀,5
One of the worst experiences. 1 and half hours since I placed the order and still no sign of it.The chat support is also of no use. Better to use other delivery channels who at least give you a better time of delivery.,1
There should the option to edit the previous order summary.. 🤔,3
I order food and I was delivered 1 hour and 30 mins instead of 23 mins of delivery time,1
"Awesome, Speedy and user friendly",5
Easy to order and satisfied,5
Whenever we place the order the order takes more than 1 hour time even after purchasing the pro service and also the customer service agent always repeat the same thing that we are sorry and will will not do that again but its look like it's there routine to make the order delay and apologies for the same its the worst thing that when we pay extra for fast service you only need to deliver it on time but its not the truth also the executives talks like robot only say the same thing.,1
"This app is useless, go to talabat or another app instead. The drivers don't know how to follow instructions and location, your food get so late, the online support team after you experience an issue and don't get food will say they are refunding your money. You are left hungry and your time is wasted.",1
Zomoto your delivery very slow took more tome for order delivery improve delivery.,1
"Very bad experience from the delivery boy. He did not keep the food properly in the bag. It was leaking and the behavoiur of the delivery boy was not good, he was speaking rudely and and run away from us",1
Such bad experience..A guy named Akash started talking to me regarding the query..the moment I asked for help regardng my uncooked food..he went somewhere and stopped replying..since last 15 mins I'm waiting for response..but still didn't get anything..such worst experience..I will never suggest Zomato to anyone..and also ask all my known people around to not use ..,1
In the offers u people are showing 50% off but you r giving only 20 to 30% kindly don't cheat the guest we are not fools and taking such a long time to delivery it's very bad,1
Last order I was not satisfied...so that they didn't refund my money... They keep on telling me to check and wait bla bla... So i hate Zomato...,1
Nice app needs to improve restaurants and proximity,4
Unreliable services. As a consumer we have no rights. What zomato says or does is law. Pathetic app and bad service guaranteed. Very poor experience.,1
Easy and Least time consuming.,5
Worst ever experience.... I had travelled from out of station to Jaipur and ordered food ... My delivery valley went to completely opposite direction of the delivery location and started shouting over call that he won't come to my location. I had guest along with me who travelled with me ... We went without dinner tonight.,1
Great job and improved service.. keep it up,4
Fast service and good customer support 👍,5
Poor service .order ready from restorent .pick boy arogntly saying i will take half hr to dilverd .also on chat miss pooja not interested to resolved the issue .such bad experiance .this is time to delete acc from zomato,1
"Worst app in case of coupon handling , they showing us false coupon options which is not applicable.. So don't be fool",2
"Time showing was not accurate, offers were not genuine",1
Must visit place for breakfast & whole day as well,5
Very bad app. It was so blurry.,1
Does bargain if you received worng product and ask to take back. Not happy at all,2
Practical and easy to use,5
"Very fast service, wonderful experience",5
Really unfair. Will reinstall this app once justice has been delivered to delivery boy Kamraj. I strongly stand with Kamraj. Good bye zomato,1
Zomato is very fast we are far from the city they will be delivered,5
"Very good customer service,if order is not good,they refund Or give promocode,I tel everyone to opt Zomato🤩",5
Promocodes don't work.swiggy is much better.even map doesn't update.,1
Very great service Delivery fast,5
"The app takes so long show available restaurants, then takes a lot of time to display menu, then again takes time to show bill. Horrible. I just close it after 10mins of waiting and order on swiggy each time. Now had enough! Uninstalled it!!",1
Best app to order anything from!!! Loving it,5
They almost poisoned me with non veg. While I ordered veg. Suddenly there was blood vomit. Beware !! Savdhaan Again it happened cockroach in my food and I am hospitalized now. Swingy is far far better app use that,1
There is mismatch from communication from Restaurant and Zomato Valet regarding order,2
Very poor service executive don't have manners how to speak with customer very very bad experience after payment can't receive order,1
Bad meal & high price.,1
Best food delivery app in India. Great service. Keep up the good work 👍,5
They delivered too much late and taste also good for some restaurant's I hate this app,1
Delivery charges are too much even if order is nearaboout. And offers are not interesting these days like minimum order amount is too much to get an offer. Rest everything is fine.,4
"Ordered item bought damaged, and delivery boy not responding to call, he did wrong that is the reason he didn't received calls, very bad service, not wearing mask,",1
Giving less rates because u don't take any action against complaints. Highly disappointed,3
Great offers and variety of restaurants,5
I received a wrong order... And there is no way I can contact you guys... The chat option is not working... As nobody is answering to my msgs...,1
Best app to order food in Bengalore. Superfast delivery.,5
Super But the customer care Is not working properly,5
"After recent update,app loading is poor",1
Very Nice Service and very Fast..,5
"This is a best aap ever to order a food , I just love this app ( Zomato ) 🥰🥰",5
Fast and on time service,5
"I booked in mojo but they are not responsive. If I ask zomato to cancel it, they are saying that they will apply cancelation charges. Is this zomato new scam",1
Best way for food but . Waiting for update,4
"Apps is really well designed, service is good. Can't compare Swiggy and Zomato. But there's a bug or idk, when I try to pull down the order tray to view the status on maps, it won't go down completely. I request Zomato Application Development team to look into this issue. Otherwise it's good clean app.",4
Most of the restaurants menu shows particular cost but in the app it shows higher cost and says it has discount. And the discounted cost would be same as original cost shown in menu. This is like fooling of users jus to pretend that the item is available for discount only in app !!,3
Fast delivery and fresh food,5
Always showing fake time and showing on time real 10 min or zomato ka 1 min Faltu app leave zomato now fake app I am installing swiggy now best aap Farzi app... And today happens not even having a good delevery partner they not assign my order never download this app again ... Whrost app ever I seen #tattizomato,1
Very good and user-friendly,5
I was in a restaurant for a take away via Zomato pro but it says currently it's not accepting orders.But the same thing I can order online which was available at the same time.Worst scam done by Zomato ever.,1
Many options to choose from. Good food.,4
Restaurant closed but the app kept showing that food is being prepared and delivery executive is late in reaching restaurant,1
Very nice app for online food order,5
"It’s a great experience. The ambiance is very welcoming and charming. Amazing wines, food and service. Staff are extremely knowledgeable and make great recommendations. This cozy restaurant has left the best impressions! Hospitable hosts, delicious dishes, beautiful presentation, wide wine list and wonderful dessert. I recommend to everyone! I would like to come back here again and again.",5
Your chat bot is useless nd the response after the message by the user is not attend,1
Weast low quality nd delivery not same on display iteams,1
Last time I ordered chicken biriyani...but hotel supplied biriyani rice only...No chicken...Why zomato promoting this type of hotel? Zomato also not supported after escalating the issue,1
Three orders placed and all three orders messed up,3
"Fantastic, Mind Blowing app for online food order.",5
maximum restaurants are offline all the times,4
Very good app .very fast delivery,5
No cash back if order delays for 30 mins ! Stubborn customer services!!!!,1
Superb service but service charges....😏,4
Good and fast service.,5
Awesome loved the quick delivery,5
The delivery guys are pathetic. You take 7 AED for the delivery but do not maintain the professionalism. This is unexpected. Horrible service.,1
Good service but choose best hotels don't service road side food,3
Food quality and price it's nice Fresh food value for money good hygiene matinee very tasty food i will suggest,5
High prices Than the original prices in restaurents ..,1
Good and fast service.,5
Always asking to place maximum amount order otherwise delivery surge,1
very poor and inefficient customer support system. the delivery guy ate my order. and despite sending dozen emails...nothing from them.,1
The app is very convenient to use and the offers are great,5
Very bad experience by my first order delivery boy came too late and food become cold . and zomato service agent too rude behaviour. So that my first order become my last order .,1
"I have paid a big amount for my delicious ice-cream and the delivery executive cane on bicycle where he stopped on the way for some time, I received my order all spoiled and wasn't in a condition to eat....will take it up on social media platforms, is this the reason zomato charging delivery fee as well?",1
"I had to go to different location to pick my order as the delivery boy was not ready to come my location, kept saying that the app is showing him that he reached, when I checked his phone it clearly showed that he is not reached the location, he quickly selected stuck in traffic option",2
Delivered on time and service was good,5
Excellent service and offers,5
"excellent food! loved the dal,batti,churma, and the paneer sabzi! worth evry penny!",5
"Worst app, If we received wrong order then we don't get proper response from zomato persons. Customer satisfaction not required for zomato 😠",1
Nice and cooperative app,5
I have received my order and I already paid amount and now they not received my call every bad service,1
"Very Bad service and customer care support. I got the different food item what I ordered. I have written complaint about the order on 3rd Jan 2021. They didn't respond on this. I again written about the complaint on 30th Jan to get the status of my order. They asked me to send the wrong item received picture and order id, I sent the same. After 2 days they said we checked with Restaurant and restaurant said they sent correct item and customer is telling lie. Zomato and Restaurant both are making customer fool and making money. you will order high value item, they will send low value item and then don't take action. Please beware of Zomato and don't be fool with their offers. At last you will be in loss. There is no 0 or negative rating so that the reason I am forced to give 1 star.",1
"It was my first experience with buying food online. First impression is the best impression! Really liked this app. The food was really good. Delivery was on time, the delivery guy was really patient and polite.",5
Good but sometimes it very expensive thankyou,5
Zomato delivery boys are highly unprofessional. During a period like lockdown I ordered food which the boy took from the restaurant and didnt deliver in time I still gave some time maybe he is geting late due to some reason but later zomato called me and told my order has canceled he delivered it somehwere else and please order something again. That too after 8pm when night curfew has started and zomato app shows sorry can't deliver night curfew has started. So I am supposed to stay hungry?,1
Very Good Service and Taste,5
Fast delivery by Vaibhav Somnath Khadke Delivery Executive I was really Hungry and he came on time my first best experience with Zomato,5
The orders sometimes take wayyyy to long.,4
Poor delivery time almost always !,1
"I love Zomato , it's a wonderful aap nd always maintain the safety measure. Love you Zomato",5
It is displaying wrond address i have corrected it but it still shows wrong address,1
The time they mention and the time it gets delivered never match... horrible,1
Nice app.... Lots of offers are there.....,4
It's always superb experience with Zomato,5
"My first experience is very bad, My order was not received, and app was saw delivered 😡😡😡😡",1
"Very very bad experience with zomoto, My amount is deducted from my account but my order is canceled and My amount is till not reversed in my account I complained many times but customer support people do nothing. I am very sad 😥 please do if possible",5
Nice app. Very helpful for food dishes,5
"Earlier i used to love this app but now swiggy is getting far better than zomato, after the introduction of zomato pro, they have reduced the discounts and offers for the normal users and has also increased the delivery charges and taxes and mostly they show coupons available but if u apply them it will show not available..in a nutshell zomato is getting costlier than swiggy so better prefer swiggy",1
Valet is froud poor service I have give order to simpl app but valet is collect cash to me & he say I will submit cash in ZOMATO account..... Today I have rcvd msg to simpl pay to don't rcvd payment...... Zomato say I don't rcvd cash.... So my money is where ....,1
Prices are double on the app when compared to the restaurant prices,3
"As earlier, I was right I have edited and rated this app 0 star, zomato your service network is one of the worst service.",1
Zomato is doing great job and also giving us their best services.,4
Always the Zomato valets are not able to reach me. And the order is always late. No o e bothers at Zomato.They don't care.we go on writing where is my order,1
He is very good app always given fast delivery I like your service thanks so much 😘😘,5
Amazing app... Food delivered on time,4
Delivery is good but but charges are too high0,1
Nice app and also instant delivery,5
So nice delivery but let pick up orders,5
"I never had bad experiences with any other applications as much as with Zomato. Bad service everytime. You guys don't even accept your mistakes and the customer service lacks empathy. I am compelled to write this review as it happened back to back. Yesterday, my coke was missing from the order and the valet lied that he didn't not get receive coke from the restaurant. Today, I had ordered from Domino's. After waiting for an hour I called up the valet who was plain rude and hung up on me.",1
Very fast and accurate delivery,5
Worst than swiggy zomato takes your order you pay them through upi /Google pay and when there rider reaches the restaurant for pick up the restaurant says please cancel the order because it will take time and when it gets cancelled your is still struggling to reach you and zomato support need a relevant team support so thank for robbing me and that to on my first order through the app thank you zomato,1
Good delivery.. Quality maintain in food,3
Great app for food and delivery,5
"Got unexpectedly fast response from the ZOMATO support team...I got a wrong order delivered, which was the restaurant's fault..I got response and immediate refund within 5 mins.. Heartily appreciate ZOMATO for giving priority to the customers.. I would like to order with none other than.ZOMATO in future..🥰🥰",5
"I love zomato,it has fast delivery, security measures, it provides us rights to give cooking instruction to the restaurant. Provides coupons,payment ideas.I have full trust and faith in ZOMATO.",5
I am not getting any valuable offers from year and they're changing too much when compared to other food delivery apps,2
Very good service and food quality 👌,5
"Poor Service.. 21 Feb 2021 - Wrong parcel sent, Pathetic service by Zomato.. Improve your service if you wish to serve people and do business, Why should I accept wrong parcel delivered to me.. Your delivery guy is not willing to return the parcel back to hotel as he loses money. The hotel was willing to accept the mistake and send the right parcel. But the delivery guy refused return of parcel and I was asked to cancel the order..no mistake from my side, I had to cancel my order.. Pathetic..",1
A good app for service food at your doorstep.,5
Very good app All things are safe during this pandemic also,5
"After long history of ordering order with zomato, including zomato membership I firmly recommend everyone to use Swiggy, earsure or Uber eats! The customer support and overall quality and quantity of food is way higher than those of zomato. In the end only thing you get is excuses like payment gateway failed etc. Those guys will eat your money and forward you scripted mails.",1
"Well my last two experience was really bad with zometo, delivery took longer than given time and food delivered was cold.",2
This worst app I have installed always in appropriate ads nd they suggest worst restaurant nd food quality whc thy suggest Will be worst nd privacy system has been hacked in ths system I suggest to not to install this app Thanks you,1
"I had bad experience with Zomato, I ordered from Domino's through Zomato, my money was deducted but order was not placed since Domino's didn't accept the request and I was told tht I will get refund with in 10-15 days . Till now I didn't get the refund and it is almost 2 months, whenever I tried contacting Zomato customer executive, they say refund process was intiated but I haven't received my money.",1
You guys loot people by showing too much overpriced menu item and high delivery charge.,1
Delivery guy should be well groomed and in dress and must give training to communicate with customers.... I had my delivery by two guys on bike with no zomato mentioned dress anywhere.... How would i know its the same person sending by zomato ... U should give them any identity card... Also they delivered food very late,1
"This is the worst app i saw. They wantedly making customer angry without responding to customer, really zomoto respond to me and i will show screenshot how ur agent make rude towards customer without supporting",1
Excellent delivery and prompt response.,5
Your app has no option to selectively mute nonsense notifications. But it has options to selectively mute essential notifications and also an option to block all notifications. Why would anyone selectively mute essential notifications? We want an option to selectively mute its nonsense notifications. Are your developers just a little slow in understanding things or absolutely arr-ogant as I can see? I'm a human being and I need a reply typed by a human; if you'd ever reply. This app sucks.,1
Not one order reached on time. Period.,1
What happened to meal for one option...it was very good,2
Awesome delivery within scheduled time,5
The chat support and the refund process is really poor. The person who is supposed to help you with your queries does not help you at all. This is really disappointing. I hope they look into this and improve the customer chat thing.,1
Very nice app and deliver on time,5
Very good application.....reach within the earliest time,4
Quality is going down!!,3
"Zomato support centre is pathetic, no response at all..very disappointing",1
Awesome app for foodies... Far Better than Swiggy and ola...,5
Very bad aap Food is not delivered on another Items are missed And not react of this types of cause,1
"Worst service. I ordered food at 19.10. It showed that the food will be delivered within 27 minutes. It is more than one and half hours. Food is not reached. Zomoto assigned to the delivery boy V. Vasanth. When I contacted Mr. Vasanth, he told me that his vehicle is break down and he said to have informed zomoto to cancel the order. But it is falsely indicating that the food will arrive in 13 minutes. When I tried to open the chat, it is not responding. I already Rs.229 including tips Rs. 20.",1
Best thing is the delivery boys are so friendly I amm so happy after using this aap🙂🙂,5
"Nice App,I say best food delivery app",5
Very good services exact on time,5
please look after the food quality of resturants they are charging too high for substandard food and plz lower ur extra charges a simple product costs us so much one cant eat everyday...properly,1
Different prices on shop/restaurant and on Zomato,1
"No support from Zomato if a consumer is fleeced by some rogue restaurant. Many a times restaurants serve incomplete, stale, undercooked items and yet no action taken",1
There is a very nice service.I just love it and the food is also tasty,5
Excellent services with fast delivery,5
I can not do any order cash on delivery on your zometo app but my friend can oder on delivery on zometo app,1
Always it's showing something went wrong. Try again,1
"Best offers and quality,nice delivery",4

Good but need to be fast little bit,5
Smart Cafeteria always come late for orders.,1
I extremely disappointed with the service! I always end up getting terrible food or missing items in my order and the worst part of all it has blocked my support page so I can't even ask for a refund. Damn Zomato what have you become. You seriously suck! I will literally not order anything till I get my refunds back!,1
Payment process is very very problematic on my order,1
Best and easy app for food delivery,5
50percent discount only good thing.for giving feedback to delivery guy I had t o update my app...,2
Zomato not have value of customers money and time. Totally wastage of money on zomato,1
"They have quite the variety when it comes to restaurants but they have pathetic staff and absolutely no concern for missed orders or customer griviences especially their online help chat section - utterly useless and pointless.... sad, unpleasant, unprofessional, irresponsible and often at times highly unreliable...",1
Good and fast service..,5
Fast & very good service.,5
They keep very neat . Nice app I never see let ke this .they has sanitized thier hands.,5
The service is too bad and disappointing both the valets and customer care servicers doesnot value our time really disappointed,1
Worst services they don't even refund the amount of something which I had ordered and it was missing because the restaurant didn't responded please be aware of this app guys,1
"Adding high rate at this lockdown period Normal people can't handle it, utilities the situation to get more earnings",1
"Really worst delivery by staff, every time delivered wrong item and taking too much time.",1
"Taxes, delivery charges are high.",1
Why there is no option to write review without uploading images.,1
I do not rememer why l gave two stars. But l remember that the service was not upto the expectation.,3
Immediate response with safe standards of delivery.,5
Zomato gold is changed to pro. Your subscription will be changed from buy 1 get 1 to 10% off on already hiked price in their app.,1
This is best and cheapest online dishes apps thanks to team Zomato,5
Just a awsome i can order any where from with a choice of many restaurant,5
Swiggy is cheaper and faster even without pro membership.,1
Good service so Far But too much delivery charges,3
"Bad experience Zomato service is going to worst Order does not taken seriously Service careless, No customer support The best day makes worst days By zomato food delivery and service Thank you making my worst day",2
It's a very nice experience.... And the thing I like the most is that it have COD...,5

"giving orders too late , and wasting of time",1
Best app for ordering food I have installed many apps but only zomaoto delivered food in my address Thank you zomato Your sevice is really good,5
Always late delivery because they assign multiple orders to delivery boy at one time,1
Awesome. Just need to make sure delivery person is able to give change,5
Super and 😋 delicious app Super delivery📮,5
Delivery boy delivered order at the wrong add and delivery boy asked extra cash to bring order,1
Late deliveries and they intelligently removed review for late deliveries.,1
"Very good app which so many good hotels. But this should not insist customer to buy minimum order value to serve. Today i ordered briyani with rate of 216rs, but zomato says min order value is 300rs. This cause too much spend on for a single person. I opted zomato pro thinking delivery free, but each order rs 500 for free delivery.",3
Customer care handling improved alot.,5
Zomato is the best delivery and taste of food is very quality and quantity.I love Zomato.,5
App is crashing... After reinstalling also i am using android 9.. honor,2
"Ordered food and got spoiled food. No proper action taken when reported. Worst service. Don't use this app. We're spending a noticable amount of money, when spending more than 500, you could offer some discounts. Very disappointed",1
Good application for traveling person for faster food 😀,5
"Very poor service. Priced on the higher side when compared to actual restaurant prices. Rude and nonchalant customer care service who don't seem to understand the problem to begin with, let alone help to resolve it. Disappointing.",1
Nice but it has location tracing problem,4
Search is iffy. Applying offers too. Pro member discount not applied,2
No option to pay cash on delivery thats the reason swiggy geta more order then zomato,1
This days this app is fraud.They send completely different food that you ordered.,1
Changing my opinion of 5 stars to 1 star even zero if had the option to do so as it came to my knowledge that you treat your Delivery Staff like some trash without investigation you fired that Boy If you believe in customer service don't Forget that your employees are the base of the Hierarchy treat them right aswell Me and My Whole Family is Uninstalling this app And I request to do this an initiative unless that poor boy gets justice ! bye bye zomato!,1
Nice i love it zomato Ian also as zomato delivery Best than others,5
Good service and safety measures are being followed,5
Delivery is very late consistently thank you.,1
Good delivery and fast delivery thankyou 😀👌,5
I received my order exactly on the time . Very satisfying experience.,5
delivery by cycle ( seriously ) it take 1.5 hrs to reach order,1
"Placed more than 15 orders ,service is too good ,the delivery boys just awsome very proffesional and they deliver very fast. Till today not seen rude behaviour with any of the delivery boys.Being your customer Im Requesting Zomato company please help deliver boy kamaraj. We all know that lady is culprit. Will wait till case is solved but she should pay for his pain.",4
"worst service in vellore.no good restaurants link, gt refund on a order by sms ..but it has been expired.. better go swiggy",1
This time order delivered was cold as Zomato assigned only one person to deliver two orders in two different directions! Whereas we stay just behind the Haldiram shop!!!!,4
Very useful app. User friendly...,5
I really love this app ..... It's soo easy to use 👍🏻,5
Everything's perfect but the new thing that has been introduced is not good. It always says to add things. They only accept order above 275 which is not good. They should change this.,5
Pathetic services by Zomato. My query has not been addressed appropriately and my refund is pending for more than a week. Everytime I try contacting Zomato support team they say they are looking into it and will refund in 5 days. It's been more than 7 days but no resolution yet.,1
Lot of offers when compare to others .... love it..... thanks zomato,5
Too good app But only one problem that it delivered late,4
"it pretty good, the best online ordering service i have tried",3
Service is very unsatisfactory... very poor delivery,5
Fastest delivered and nice service,4
1 star deduct for high delivery charges.. overall good experience,4
I apply the promo code but after placing order I had to full charge of my order,1
"This app is cheating customers. I ordered food, but restaurant didn't delivered my products. I payed through card. But they didn't give my money back. I ask the restaurant they said the Zomato will send the money. But they cheated me. I didn't get my money back.",1
"I really like this app, the order has just arrived before 15 minutes . But this is a request : I understand that cod is is not kinda safe now but could you just increase the max amount to buy food in cod, cuz it's necessary to buy food for whole family. Tq😊",4
"Hi Zomato team, I didn't asked for the extension but you people gave it anyway. That was the best thing happened to me and am sure to everyone since being in quarantine. Thank you so much for lovely jesture. It is really Appreciated by me and my family. We can't wait till this issue is over and jump back to ordering food! thanks for being there and yes we all are in this together like a Big Family ❤️🙏 love it!",5
"Worst experience, they provide off brand items in place of quality food chains. That do not take responsibility of fake off brand food items being delivered with the same images pricing and name.",1
Not any discount show to me Very bad app for price of food,1
In the ' TIPS ' option you have to give an option to the customer. I might like to pay Rs10/=. But you are letting us choose Rs20/= only on your app,5
Loved it. Easy to use and easy to manage.. Would suggest to have a section where I can save my favourite restaurants. And save my orders which I wanted to repeat. And so timely rewards for frequent user.,5
Stop your idiotic Email Marketing. Even though I have unsubscribed from the list am receiving it.,1
Very good service..freshly served nd in time,5
Excellent work done by zomato a fastest delivery,5
Why are you reading messages? Why is the OTP automatically verified? Uninstalling your app.,1
Clear efficient and easy to use,5
Worst service from zomato...shift to swiggy...better not to order from zomato...very worst,1
Good and timely servicing,5
"Very good app except the fact that the delivery remaining time shown is totally bogus. Example, I order at 7pm and when its accepted shows me 45 mins left till delivery. After 45 mins, it shows 15 mins to delivery, and after 15 mins it shows 5 mins to delivery, etc. So instead of 45 mins it reaches me after 65 mins! Cool way to confuse customers. Otherwise nice app.",3
"I downloaded to order for my Mom's marriage anniversary. The food was good,fast delivery, minimal charges.I'm happy.",5
Fast delivery and good services,5
I hadnt faced any issue till now....so its good app according to me...will update my review later,4
Good quality is not this is bad and not worth,2
"This App is not familiar to order food, can somebody write a app name here to orders food.",1
"I was soo disappointed about the refund issue.this is 2nd time I'm facing this problem.customer care people are telling that they initiated refund amount but it didn't reflect In my Account.its almost 13days completed.if I raise any complaint, they'll assign me one person and finally they end up saying they hv already initiated refund and it'll reflect within 4 to 5 business days.thats it and there is no progress at all.",1
"Horrible, I ordered food for my guests and after one hour of waiting, they could not deliver the food and they cancelled the order, I am humiliated before my guests",1
"very bad customer support and also prise is different in zomoto and restaurants. 20% high prise in zomato, and why I contact in email?, why yr not customer care no. And direct talk with our issue... I share many time yr email but you nathing do.",1
Very nice delivery will always on time,5
Worst food ordering app. These guys don't even display the food menu properly. Worst customer care service. Go for some other food ordering app. Zomato is the worst!,1
Do visit this lovely cafe in South Delhi. The ambiance is just perfect mainly for the art lovers and photographers. I have never seen such a place filled with life. The service is unmatched. The staff truly cares about your experience and also help you explore their creations. The food is absolutely amazing – everything we tasted melted in other mouths. Highly recommend!,5
Too much of content in order tracking page.,3
Awesome app with good discounts and promocode,5
Day by day the service is getting bad. They are asking a cycle rider to deliver foods in two opposite direction from the restaurant and each destinations are 2.5 km away from the restaurant. Due to that one of the customer will get their order delayed. And this isn't a one-off situation. Bless them.,3
Very good response from Customer service..I received wrong order I informed then they will returned my money.. 👍,5
Pathetic.. Most of the time Promo Codes issues ..,1
Good delivery prosses and nice service,5
Some dishes are much costlier at zomato then restaurant..,1
"Useless app. Delivers wrong orders. Not follow instructions. Takes too long time to deliver service. Unprofessional, untrained, delivery staff. I have ordered paneer bhurji for 260₹. But delivery person gave wrong item. Wasted my money, time, food. Very worst app to use.",1
Worst support system u have i have raised issue in mail 2days completed but there id no response,1
Very slow delivery & not safe service,2
Very slow delivery. Not at all satisfied with zomato,1
Very good app and helpful customer service and Zomato pro is very good program offered by Zomato,5
"awesome place for momos , wraps, rolls, panner and chicken tikkas, fries. love the food",5
This is the third time in a row that Zomato has delayed my order by 2 hours...it's the worst delivery service ever for the price they charge....,1
"The service is not good, there's no helpline email id. Looks like we cant even do a complaint against zomato app service and restaurant. There were times in uberEats decade, we were able to register complaints for any bad food or service.",1
"I had tough time with Swiggy, after I switched to zumato nothing like this. Best of all app's",5
One of the best apps I have come across for the food delivery...,5
It is awesome but some times late but it is but when we are hungry we will get angry 😡 Just saying don't worry,5
Very good app And very fast delivery,5
Worst app & those services are not really well to appreciate am just deleting this worst food delivery app,1
Worst quality food has been delivered.. moreover the executives are not ready to compensate for that... And shown rough behaviour.,1
"Its Is very good,it gives me food on time nd by sitting in home only I can eat outside food,thank you zomato😊",5
"Worse customer service, no money return no food on time, total disaster customer service experience today order. Never again .good bye zomato",1
"You guys raised delivery charges straightaway to 47 rs irrespective of the "" distance"" of restaurant. So I have to pay rs 47 delivery charge even for a restaurant which is just 200 meters away..at least try to balance the interests of both consumers & delivery guys..",1
There's always delay in delivering orders.,1
Good offers always nd better than swiggy.,5
it was a great experience because preparation and presentation was good,5
Poor service also no solution to the query raised.... unsatisfied,2
Auspicious app so good but packing is some important aur legpiece nhi ata .,5
"Very good app.. A lot better than Swiggy.... I would suggest to use this app instead of Swiggy..,",5
Good & fast delivery,5
"✨Easy to use, understand and order.. Superb service.. But most loveable are the notifications!! We always go mad if any app sents notification again n again but I read n wait for your next notification always.. you guys are super creative..keep going with the good work guys.🎀❣️",5
REALLY VERY FAST AND GOOD. NEVER EXPECTED. THIS IS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE THANK YOU.,5
Prices on zomato are higher than actual prices on restaurant menu.,1
Nice app fast delivery and tasty food order,5
Very bad service Zomato delivery person not delivered your order and not pick call.after he switched off phone.support team not give you satisfied answer.so plz avoid Zomato service.third class service.,1
Till the zomato delivery guy does not get the justice and compensation for him till that time it will be 1star and i will uninstall it immidiately.,1
Good services and good discount offer provided by company,5

Very bad meal... Ordered from Punjabi Nukkad Pure veg .. veg noodles was very very bad it burns my kids tangue and lips...we put the noodles in dust bin.. other order was shahi Punjabi thali and it was pathetic test and incomplete order.... Friends DONT USE THIS APPP.....,1
One stop for all your food recommendations.. my all time favourite..,5
Late food delivery. I ordered food at 9.00 pm Zomato boy delivered it at 11.00 pm. My kids slept after a long wait.,3
Every food item price on zomato are more than actual price! And not just 20-30 Rs. more it varies on every item 70-90 Rs. Extra!! 😡🤬 Came to know about this when i visited the restaurant today and saw the actual price.. and also they add more price saying taxes & for delivery! 🤬🤬🤬,1
Nice first time using very easy Search .... N easy to order,5
"Poor customer support .. trying to understand whether the good service was for Covid 19 only?? Everytime i face an issue with any order and try to contact Zomato, I get a bot instead or an email id with auto reply service (sounds like a bot too) .The restaurant refused to dispatch the order because it didn't have one of the items ordered and told me to cancel the order.The valet stood there and tried contacting Zomato support but he couldn't reach them either. Is this how u treat pro customers??",1
"It is not about ur app but it is entirely about the way u treat people.... my husband ordered a biryani from paradise and Haleem. The restaurant forgot to send haleem which was of 220rs, ur people sent a coupon of 200 which wasn't right where u should have credited the amount back to his account, after hell lot of arguments. This kind of behavior wasn't really accepted and we have taken oath never to order from zomato in life.",1
Uptil now no problem I faced with Zomato. Service is good.,4
Amazing and good service,5
Worst experience with some restaurants specifically Box8 No proper response from ur team regards my order and really never expected Im not gng to install again zomato,1
Order not serviced and forcefully having to cancel. Really bad stuff!,1
Very good experience with accessing the zomato app,5
Whatever is your amount to be paid they will always demand add more item and pay for it unnecessarily,1
"best place for Couples ,friends and Family",5
Very useful when we are hungry. Thank you Zomato.,5
Superb sarvice and fast delivery time,3
"Ignoring Special Commands zomato Totally Ignore the Special Instructions given by customer. While Ordering from Susaki Chinese Restaurant, I gave voice command that I want Hakka Noodles without any Vegetable but there were all the vegetables. Long time ago, the same happened when I ordered chowmein from Noodle Heights. Really disappointed.",1
Very pathetic service and bad experience. Other online food delivery apps are good. Don't go for zomato.,1
Service has very much improved.,4
"Quality and quantity is pathetic, stale food, a very long hair in curd, spilling problem, injected cucumber in salad, cold food, please don't order from urban angeethi, they might serve you just OK food only when you order for the first time and afterwards you will only regret, don't waste your money",1
Nice app. Discout coupon are always available,4
"Over priced all the times, also no quality food available.",1
"Poor service, no customer care service. Swiggy se better from zomato, not satisfied from zomato service. Not happy..",1
"Amazzing app!give it a try as its very easy,respects your privacy and gives you tasty food!!I do have one problem though its that,a lot of resturants don't deliver to Sharjah please fix that as some of my favourite resturants that are in dubai do not deliver,please fix it asap!!!:-)",4

Very much punctual time maintained. Well behaved.,5
Excellent💯👍 Very very fast service and excellent rider,5
Nice app with best offers on food ordering.,5
First-class .. I use this quite often n enjoy every time delivery partners are humble n professional,5
Rates are different from the actual rates in restaurent.,3
"Non Veg items get delivered for veg items ordered, checks by restaurants serving veg & non-veg food before packing to be made mandatory where the person who placed order get notification confirmation of packing before the parcel is handover to delivery agent. Disappointed with the order and Zomato. Decided not to use the app in future. People ordering veg items from non-veg restaurants to be utmost cautious before having the food received.",1
App needs improvement. Specially the part where we connect to the customer care. I have been trying to chat for more than 30 mins but the chat box is frozen and no executive has pinged me yet in the chat area. Pathetic experience.,1
Very good and fast service,5
My go to app for all the time. I spend more time in zomato rather spending it on and any other app😘,5
World's most pathetic app I have ever seen every 10 days it asks for update frequent updates what it updates I don't know it is most pathetic services provided by Zomato why it is updating every 10 days if he has to update why don't to release the final version updating frequently whether these people are taking money from people and on-time delivery is not available very fantastic service in the world,1
it was very bad experience my order got rejected and they are not refunding it asking tume for 7 days,1
"Awesome app ,helps a lot during this covid situation",5

Fast service and best delivery employees,5
Fast delivery and easy work system,5
Nice app to order Food easily..,5
Superb and fast delivery,5

stupid company. canceled cash on delivery service for me. for one cancelation of order. i did it due to their mistake,1
"Great app 👌..! Having the best delivery guys , With all the safety measures .... #thankyouzomato #weloveyou !!!!",5
You should first let the restaurant accept the order and THEN process the customer's payment.,3
"Nice packing,good service n fast,taste also 👌",4
Wrost service ever when we have to pay they deduct EMMIDIEATLY but when they have to refund they take 4 to 7 days Why..?,1
No proper tracking update .shows Incorrect update,1
App is not working Whenever I try to open it's says Try Again,1
So bad this app doesn't work properly ( technical issues ),1
Delivery charge are too expensive means we need to pay almost 70+ rupees extra on every order which is Disgusting.,1
The app logo is not good plzzz changed . Make a new logo design.,5
This app will force you to eat..... They doesn't know servive apart business.... Stick with stirctly busine ss... Don't use this app.... Simply they pick your pocket money with this app... Assholles,1
"55 minutes after I place the order, the rider says that there are two orders that are late Ordered when hungry But not for breakfast tomorrow ഞാൻ ഓർഡർ ചെയ്തിട്ട് 55 മിനിറ്റ് ആയി റൈഡർ പറയുന്ന രണ്ട് order ഉള്ളതുകൊണ്ടാണ് ലേറ്റ് ആകുന്നത് എന്ന് വിശക്കുന്ന സമയത്താണ് ഓർഡർ ചെയ്യുന്നത് അല്ലാതെ നാളെ രാവിലെ കഴിക്കാൻ വേണ്ടി അല്ല",1
Very bad service to customers. No option to know status of food at restaurant. Zomato vallet was so irresponsible. Zomato support executive doesn't respond to our need.,1
I ordered food from salad republic today evening. Got a call from them saying that the Zomato delivery guy was drunk and therefore they did not give the parcel to them. Salad republic people were generous enough to send their own delivery guy to my place. Zomato kindly look into the matter. Drunk delivery boys are not acceptable.,1
Easy and secure.....but plz give more promo code for delivery.....by the way it's,5
The delivery price and other taxes is rising day by day...dissapointing...otherwise otgerthings are good....,3
"App is a little complicated, lots of info to read.",4
Great food with value for money!,5
Horrible!!! Rider said he is not paid salary and has no money for fuel. My children were very unhappy after waiting for +2hrs and never get it delivered.,1
Wow Discounts Discounts n more discounts on Zomato..superb,5
Super fast delivery on this app,5
Good service and delivery within time given. Through the lockdown- once we restarted ordering -happy to see the valet following all the protocols and the services from the places we ordered food- have had no issues. Well done and keep it up - making sure the outlets continue to follow food safety guidelines so what your valet delivers - is good.,4
After long time I really had a good variety of food at a worthy price.,4
"Even more than a year after the big design change, it's still confusing. Please change to a more intuitive interface. ""Around you"" and ""view on map"" are still functions limited to the website.",4
Customer care support experience is good.they don't entrain with the problems of their customers.this is my reason to rate Zomato 5star.just taxes are too much high.but u should improve high taxes,5
It's a best way of explore the new dishes from new restaurant's from your home only. And every time we got the good discount also. I am using this app from last 2 years. I will definitely recommend for using this app.,5
"Absolutely horrible customer service, I received a bad order and talked to 3 excutives and nor one did anything and wasted soo much of my time",1
"Super great, We liked the super fast delivery..thank you .....",5
Price is too high and the food quality is not too good but not bad.. 🙂,4
Extremely great app delivery is so fast,5
Extra charges of food is being charged,1
"Chat support is poor, don't solve the issues",1
Was my first order enjoyed my food was in time as suggested in app,5
I am pick order main road. My house or main road distance 0.5km .so,1
"Experience is pathetic. I will suggest never to use it. No proper customer support. If the order gets cancelled on Zomato's behalf, customer has to pay for it. Facilities are even worse in Hyderabad.",1
It is good and I want to say that it is best that we can ask for anything from home,5
Worst too much delay for service.dont pick this app.worst app Response also very poor,1
Zomato are taking advantage of people by mandatory order of Rs. 375 in this tough times like covid 19. How can a bachelors order in these tough times? Very disappointed. Its best if people go to swiggy.,1
Lootying business...offers varying for each contact number..not happy with Zomato..,1
Faulty map directions of delivery person. It shiws route which does not exist,3
Better way to Dine out and/or order food online.,5
provide good offers and fast delivery with in the time,5
Superb and fast delivery,5
Super exelent service and delivery in exacting timeevery time thank u,5
It takes too much time for delivery. Try to make delivery faster.,1
prices are marked higher in the app than the restaurant.,2
Best offer..Best restaurants range.. quality presentation,5
Very helpful and lovely app lots of love to ZOMATO❤,5
"I placed an order from crispy chicken abudhabi, 20 pieces of broasted chicken. They sent only 19 pieces. This kind of service is not acceptable. Totally disappointed!!!!",1
good experince and fast service site✌,5
"Pathetic.. all my food were spiller and not well handled. I paid 2k for my bloody food including their nonsense delivery fee and that's how dey take care. Moreover, u cannot chat wid CX service agent unless dey give you an option to type. Idiot's.",1
Safe & timely delivery delivery👍,4
I loved the app...and happy to use...all in all a good service..cheers,5
Zomoto all ways beter than swiggy. Go for zomoto with safe and in time delivery,5
Delivery is taking to much time as mentioned scheduled.,1
Very very bad service...cheaters...do not give mention cashback..No customer service..no reply from help desk...avoid it...,1
It's good and cheap than any other similar apps.,5
"For my last 3 orders, the items were missing and when I tried to complaint, there was no resolution. I didn't receive the missing item or any refund as no one took the responsibility be it valet or the restraunt. Highly disappointed!",2
Zomato just loots in the name of pro. Swiggy is far ahead in discounts and rates. So made a fooloish dicsion by opting for pro.,2
Why removed market option from app earlier vegetable was available but not available currently,1
"Got my food more than hour late from a restaurant 4 km away. It was picked up 10 minutes into ordering. But then the valet decided to go on a joyride, guy didnt even leave the restaurant location after picking up my order till the delivery time was up, poat which he went somewhere else. The last order before that was spilt all over the bag and uneatable. Diaappointment seems to be a pattern with this one. And they are not compensating me in anyway for my wasted time and money.",2
This is an fantastic food ordering app I like this very much 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊👌👌👌👌👌,5
the hunger saver for me never disappointed with the offers and service,5
Very late service its never on time Very bad experience,1
Nic and i experierance that food delevery was at genuine price,5
Very good app food delivery,5
They are now charging delivery fees along with taxes and it's really costly,2
Fast delivery and very good prodect,5
"Quite handy, just that sometimes valets r not available!",4
Swiggy is best than You... i bought Zomato 1 year membership.. still when i add food in my cart from both Apps... Swiggy gives me better price options and cost effective without any membership ...and After a Pro member of Zomato it costs more for me as compare to swiggy... Zomato is looting people with pro membership and promo codes.... Beware,1
Very very worst app . Cheating customers . No service provided to the customers. All bluffing cheating worst worse . No words to explain their cheating techniques,1
i love this app it's very helpful during hungry time,5
Not getting opened again and again crashing,5
very nice app for those who live in rural area,5
Nice offers.. fast delivery..,5
Best app with extra discount and coupons on orders 🙂,5
"If I could I wouldn't gave even that one that I gave super bad feeling it said they can deliver, what the heck is this like Zomato is meant for delivering not for telling people that they can't deliver..!!",1
Worst customer service experience ever. I told the rep I'll post and they never minded. Zomato is a good platform. Your chat agents makes it the worst. Please do something.,1
"I would give 0 star, delivery boys are fraud I ordered burger, when the order came, I was busy in work and I paid the money for the order, then I remembered that I had already made the payment online. I called him again and again he didn't respond then I contact with zomoto they gave his number and said we can't do anything as this matter is between you and delivery boy,I contact that number continuously but not responded. Will never order again from zomato",1
Worst app....they delivered stale food to me and during feedback offered me a refund of only rs 100 whereas the food was worth 500 Extremely sorry...worst app ever,1
Excellent Service and delicious food.,5
Worstest app. No quality of food is maintained. ONLY Waste of money.,1
"Zomato is the looser app plz use swiggy app because I have thrice complaint non have been resolved, they book street hawkers and make it restaurant, today I booked fried rice from by brother AC they have send uncooked rice and unhygienic manner I have a prove for Zomato complaint. Zomato is a profit organisation company it take and covid risk",1
I ordered veg Biryani and I got egg biryani..this needs to be rectified..you do not get veg Biryani at chickpet donne biryani..still it shows as veg on zomoto app,1
"Delivery executive refuse to deliver and ask to cancel by self and continuously called thrice by Zomato landline while I kept on chatting on Zomato support and support guy can't call me. Even after wait of more than an hour the delivery executive, as threatened over call, turned the status as order delivered and support executive said he can't do anything. Later on as token gave me refund and coupon. Is this what Zomato stand for, I'm moving to swiggy, live with your big ego and fake advertising",1
I got delayed delivery but zomato apologized and gave me additional 75rs off on next order without asking. That was great.,5
"Fantastic app, great selection, amazing customer care. Need to work on reducing delivery charges ( as high as 70rs on some orders) but hey its covid time so I understand their woes as well. Great jobs with the UI, devs.",4
"On time delivery, excellent",5
"Delivery charge is no , delivery is so good",5
Such a helpful and beneficial application! Hats off to the developers 🌸.,5
Cask on delivery is not available . Plz check it and apply,3
Good service with correct GPS service,4
"No support from customer service, they only pre defined replies",1
Very nice and reasonable rates,5
sometimes the app crashes so 4 star....now I have met with your intern jayaditya whose work has met with the aspirations of dragons of jwala.... So 5 star... Paise badha do uske....,5
Best and easiest way to order at home,4
"App is good , but First I am getting more coupons and offers But now I am not getting even a single discount",3
"App creators don't care about the apps original purpose of reviewing anymore. I asked for zomato gold refund due to pandemic closures and they refused. Yet the service announced closure a week later. Restaurant updates such as adding new places or notifying of closures are not easy to make and the responses are slow. My neighbourhood has many closed places I have reported several times. After becoming Level 15 reviewer years ago, I am using Google Maps for restaurant info and reviews instead.",1
No proper service for delivery also hotel people seek for extra money and zomato is not having control over hotel or delivery partner,1
Good in taste...and on time delivery..,4
Very nice app for fooding order.,5
Great experience 👍...and also fast service thanks,5
"Payment successfuly done instatly,when we make payment. & The refund process will take 4-7 days. That means you hold your customer's money to doing another business with your customer's money. Please describe your excuses",1
I reset my phone then installed zomato..not working even not open,1
Never trust zomato on this app if u order something with instruction and still restaurant don't follow instructions then zomato Customer care person says Customer to understand not to restaurant they r big cheater never order on zomato,1
Amazing app very easy ordering system,5
"Ordered chilli chicken from here what ti say about the taste, generally I don't review but when I do it is supposed to be the best.Loved it.",3
Worst response at the time of ordering...Pops up msg something went wrong,1
Good source to get quality food in few minutes,4
Received incorrect dish which i ordered. Further the quantity of breads ordered are also less,1
Very slow some times it's not open,3
Super service in pandemic secautaion for food delivery,5
"My order did not got delivered and the money was not refunded, they have started cheating their customers it seems..",1
Really the worst service not expecting this kind of attitude.. To a pro customer you are charging a cancellation fee which has your fault in delivery.,1
Superb And Easy to order food We Love Zomato,4
Very useful and fast delivery,5
Good Application with awesome discount.,5
cleanliness and hygiene products. superb quality food and beverage 😋,5
Got a spoiled rolls ..this is what we get if we ordered online for emergency in discount food ?? Shame on it,1
"They add extra on the restaurant's menu while adding some extra delivery cost as well, I mean why? Worst food delivering application. Bad customer service. Pathetic application as well, unlimited number of bugs.",1
Fast Delivery. Polite valet. Safe & Secure.,5
I had a good experience by ordering from zomato .... It's. A good app,3
Live tracking status not getting updated....,1
"Very nice app, this fast food delivery.",5
"The delivery agent without delivering my order had confirmed that the order was delivered. As the order was already paid for, zomato executives claimed that nothing was possible in this situation.. Neither a refund nor a second attempt at delivery. Extremely disappointed as i have never faced such an inconvenience on any other app.",1
not showing correct location and status after update🙄🙄,5
good support and super fast delivery and food is really hygienic thank you zomato,5
Good restaurant for biryani lovers. good food with more quantity and quality..,5
Im here after comparing the prices with swiggy and zomato is really better with prices loveee it,5
The order is super late every time,1
It is nice and easy to order 😇😇😇,4
"I ordered my meal and paid online, but neither I received my delivery nor I got my money back Fraudsters There should be options for negative ratings too",1
Very bad application...swiggy is fat better than this....almost one month is over.... but my refund still missing🤬🤬🤬🤬😠😠😠,1
"Can't order most of the time because riders are not available, or the restaurants (all of them) aren't delivering to my area but after waiting for an hour or two, everything is back to normal again. WTH!?",1
Awesome app with verities and the offers. Good job,5
Such an awesome app....on time delivery 🚚...love this app Thank you Zomato,5
I love the app especially review is very credible,5
"I am a gold user, but never really understood how really is it beneficial for me. It's simply waste of money.",2
The new policies which zomato has made is ridiculous and frustrating if the order is delayed they don't refund the money and cancel the order instead there agents they give you cheap explanations regarding the order and say its going to arrive shortly where they are going to take there own sweet time. Please feels like you are being scammed very bad.,1
Horrible customer service. Artificial intelligence chats. Customer support can't solve problems. Disgusting App.,1
Any issues with order with in time they are clear that issue,5
Awesome cuisine and great offers,4
Ordered from app selecting on time or free option. When the order couldn't be delivered on time the order was cancelled by zomato and refund was initiated. When questioned about on time or free option coupon of 150 was given. Wasted 2 hours by giving false updates,1
"1. Worst customer service. 2. Poor and bad delivery service 3. no response from customer service. 4. They putting orders hold and cancelled and simply refund the minimum amount in the form of vouchers. I have ordered 1423.80/- on 05/02/2021. I am waiting till 3 hours. There is no response. after that suddenly i got a message my order was cancelled. But, they are not refund the full amount of 1423.80. Bad Service. customer service people doesn't believe it! Its totally not worth your money and time.",1
"best food,cafe Kolhapuri is multicusine family dining place recently opened in virar east. we tried their Kolhapuri signature dishesh was delicious and well spiced .tambda pandra rassa ,on of my favourite. mutton sukhha,mutton kharda. we tried there mutka dum biriyani it was so yummy and worth for money. one of us tried there thali, quality of the food and quantity is worth as per their price. one of low price budget and quality food place for family.",5
It's best ever... Thank u Zomato... Sometimes it off the shot..but otherwise.. it's the best ..❤️❤️,5
Very fast and easy delivery,5
Ordered from pizza hut and received cold dry pizza with uncooked sausage Highly disappointed and Zomato is totally unconcerned about this complaint. Very disappointed with your service Zomato,1
Excellent delivery app. Thank you Zomato team,5
Easy and fast delivery,4
Sometimes Zomato delivery guys are rude. I faced this incident two time. I had uninstalled Zomato last month after my second frustrating verbal spat with Zomato guy. I only want to give my feedback after learning about Hitesha's incident. I WAS a Zomato customer from past several years. But I faced two unpleasant incidents in past 6 months. It is better to be safe than use Zomato. The Customer care is pathetic too.,1
"Delivery person behavior is good 👍, wearing his helmet well",5
Waited one hour for one hour.. not delivered.. finally Zomato cancelled.. pathetic service,1
Good Service And Fast Food Delivery Make .!,4
Quick and easy service,4
Best offer and less delivery time.,5
Ideal cafe is always good food.no doubt,5
Very bad I'm cancel my order amount is 151 INR but I'm not recieved my refund amount but amount deducted.. Very bad service zomoto. I'm recommend don't use zomoto.,1
Zomato disappoint with delivery most of the times,2
Zomato gold was better but now Zomato pro membership is totally waste.,3
Zomato is doing better nowadays and I hope they keep up the good work!,4
Can be better in user experience and delivery charge applied,3
"Sorted, updated and feeded all smooth like butter.",5
In time delivery taste was good,5
Sometimes extraordinary... Super fast delivery.. Nice tasty foods.. Some times outed foods.. Whig is bad in smells and texture...,4
These people according to their will sometimes cancel the order at important time and their stupid help team just waste the time ....,1
In these worst situations also they served well and i wish they will always be best . Blessings,5
Worst better is swiggy and other application because if they provide u stalk or wrong food they won't take any action all you have to just rate the restaurant and food but in other food application they provide you option of refund or replacement and tell the restaurant to improve the quality of food... And its expensive than other the code and discount are just to make fool... This is really important thing a online food delivery app should provide us thats why request to all give them one star,1
App is good but customer care executives and vallets lie some time,5
Like the app..has more options in my area... But not many discount options like Swiggy.,4
The chat bot and service resolution is disgusting,1
App could not help delivery for address.,1
Worst ...dont ever use ...swiggy is far better ..they are looting customer by fake restraunt names & charging wrong amoumt and wrong order process in app,1
Extremely poor customer care service. Can't except more bad service than this.,1
very bad service ☹️... they won't delivery in time...and no money refund,1
2 hours late and still on the way - and the executive don't receive my phone,1
Delayed service. Too much delay,1
High cost of food Too much delivery charge Dealyed deliveries Less options Stale food,2
Very poor food delivered by Zomato and order quantity is very low and take higher amount for that's and also smells are coming from food also food are fall in poly bag very bad its shameful app.😥🤐🙄😪,1
Super and fast delivery,5
Pathetic customer support. Agents do not even bother to respond. Highly unprofessional support system,1
"I wish there was zero as rating. They are pure fraudulent who are taking advantage of the habit of common public ordering food online. Poor and pathetic customer support. They charge 70rs as a delivery fee for a nearby restaurant while the same order from same hotel , they charges 20-25 rs earlier. Even swiggy at the same time charges only 25rs compared to 70 in Zomato for same hotel. Zomato is fraud",1
"It's good, fast and according to needs.",5
The worst app ever ... M a pure vegetarian person and because of u delivered me wrong order I have eaten non veg after eating I realised .. what u guys have done is not forgettable. And m going to file a case against the restaurant and Zomato.,1
"Good sevice, very easy to use app",5
Simple and easy to use,4
Best service and well planned system,5
"Zomato doing frauds with his customers, because when u book a food order nd pay total amount before deliver food & by default u choose wrong location, then can't change ur right location, when u talk his customers support by msg then they cancel ur order online but ur paid amount is not refunded to ur UPI ID....they told u ur amount refunded 2 to 3 working days but that never come in account..... Plz be aware from these types of Fraud Food Apps.It's very disappointing to me, they was not refund.",1
Delivery boy was good but Zomato should provide some umbrella are anything in summer because it's kalaburgi too hot,5
"App kept having issues...I had to put in details of payment, orders etc multiple times. And then couldn't put the message on the cake as well. So app was actually quite useless.",1
App is very easy to order and on-time delivery. But it is not showing cash on delivery this is the only one defect. But swiggy is giving cash on delivery. If zomato takes it. It will be good.,5
Worst app... Customer service is very poor... Really don't like this app,1
Great experience.... The Mohsin Khan was out for the delivery... Thank you so much... For being so helpful...,5
Very good service Delivery service is very hygienic They following covid precautions 🥳,5
Worst app I ordered one food itself got canceled and then One order placed is late Valet saying its late customer care executive not responding these are Fake apps not recamendale to install its not trust worthy app,1
It is the best app ever we can order anywhere the restaurant is,5
Nice app. Fast delivery. Full safety,5
Very bad services the chat support executives are rude or not answering....i am trying since 2 weeks,1
1)Their website doesn't serve the entire delivery menu which the restaurant's have to offer to the customer's. 2)Their delivery charges are on the higher side and more so after paying the delivery executives high charges most of the time there is a food handling and spillage problem from their delivery executives. There's Much more to write but I think Google play store can't except more than 500 word's of critical remarks in general & Zomato & other APP's On the App Store,3
Worst app they won't provide refund for the undelivered foods and there is no proper support,1
Excellent food delivery app only one from all others 👌,5
Whenever opening this App they have the best offers a customer would ask for 😁😁 Loved it 🤗🤗,5
Super service. In night curfew,5
"Poor application can't contact normally to costumer care, wrost services and just eat your pro membership money",1
Very useful and good services 👍 go for it.,4
Worst service....time taken more than 1 order for less half kilometr and delivery boy phone not working,1
Late deleviry common and price too high,1
Scamming system. They cancelled the order without calling me and charged the full amount. It's very common phenomenon.,1
Fast and timely delivery.,5
3rd class delivery service. Customer care executive is so irresponsible. They don't have a brain to use. Since 2hr they only fooled me by saying yes we are trying to deliver ur food but... Nothing has happened. Till now. So rude Zomato.. this is so not done.... Disgusting.... I am a pro member but I faced this type of behavior. Shiiiiii shame on you.,1
"It was the worst experience, the test is bad. Cold drink not provided. Feel cheated",1
"First they say Zomato Pro has no minimum ticket size, then after taking they say minimum transaction required.",1
Your service is very fast.....that's why I am satisfied with your service.,5
Love the service they give me everytime...thanks zomato😍 I hope it should be like this always,5
Delivery charges are high.,1
Zomato has become very expensive now.no great deals available anymore.,4
worst service in Rohtak 124001.. Switching to other delivery app... Providing food with flies...Yaak.. Most unprofessional support team. No discipline. Uses abusive language. Pathetic service.,1
"outstanding, very delicious food keep up the good work ZOLD 💚",5
I find many of your zomato drivers driving in wrong lane of road for quick delivery. Please ensure strict protocol in these regards.,3
late delivery are very often to see. No professionalism at all. SWIGGY is far better in professionalism.,1
Very bad order panni more then 1hr . Delivery boy not picking the call not even,1
Orders have always been good.,5
"We ordered for 2 full Chicken biryanis and a mini chicken biryani from Naatimane hotel, Chikkamagaluru. None of the biryanis had chicken. Pure case of fraud on part of restaurant. We contacted Zomato support, they mentioned they couldn't reach the restaurant which was was even more frustrating.",1
I ordered food from zomato but unable to add my GST number and zomato team also unable to add.,1
Excellent service all the time.,5
when i ordered it asked me for more items to add than only they will deliver. this is rubbish,1
"Misleading app. Told me to order above rs 275 to place order for food due to high demand. I checked on Swiggy and there was no such high demand from the same restaurant and they allowed to order at much lower value. Zomato team, either check with the partner restaurant or be willing to lose orders.",1
"I wanted to download my bill invoice but redirected link is not working. Zomato, are you a 10K rupees company ? Very unprofessional service. Even bill download is failing wow zomato developers 😆🙌 #Salute",2
"I order chocolates shake...first cancel my order just because of high demand but if i order something more they will accept the order what is this... After ordering something more.. Wait for 45min and i got half glass of shake which is Worst in taste, not cool.... Now i will never order anything from here😤😠",1
Great interface and service,5
"Express order placement, good upi interface",4
"Customer service is extremely good, whenever I have had issue with some orders they have compensated it with cashback coupons immediately or tried to really solve the issue. That's really appreciable.",4
Great option for work from home doing ppl who cant cook,5
I have Ordered spring roll ४ and CHOWMIN २ but it was DELIVERD wrongly and the item DELIVERD was also FOUL smell and taste was also very bad............... Atleast ZOMATO should think of their regular customer and refund the amount paid,1
Very fast delivery happie with the service,5
Very late delivery no there is no tracking details properly.....,3
When u cancel the order you will not get your money back. Biggest drawback,1
"It's really good app, as compared to its compitators",5
Worst experience always late delivery and no responsibility unprofessional way of dealing with customers I will never use this application one more time,1
Good app Nice Easily orders food,5
very bad food very bad service no air conditioning when asked they say it's on when it's clearly very hot. no person tho clear the table or attend the guests. the food was even worse ordered 2 burgers and so substandard tastes kfc wud taste better it so salty so dry very disappointed ☹️,1
Speed is ok but cost and shipping is too high,4
For the most pathetic customer support. Just to let others future zomato pro subcriber know that you won't be given fair resolution even if they failed to deliver the food you order and for a refund they would fool you in some or the other way by hidden terms and condition which you are aware resulting in more profit to them. Be cautious.,1
Y this zomato tells us to add more items to place the order and we know how much quantity we have to order why u people suggest us,1
Neat and easy ordering experience,5
I was user of SWIGGY but I didn't get any support from there while I got missing items. But today I used zomato and support team was awesome 👌.. Now I continuing it. #Amir,5
Very good & Super fast service,5
"Worst experience I had today, I ordered pizza at 8.32pm and till 11.41 pm it shows 22 mjn left for your order delivery. Isn't it disgusting...",1
very good Food and fast delivery,5
"Experience is good, should more promotion expected from Zomato.",5
Worst app they are not responding for anything i got 5 time problem in zomato in food,1
Very good app to order food.,5
good and fast delivery service,5
Yes i like this app very easy to reach your order,5
This is to inform you that I really had a bad experience with zomato. I think Zomato doesn't have enough riders to deliver the food to the customers. I ordered masala dosa from Sagar Ratna and the rider called me up and said that I don't have enough battery at my mobile phone and will not be able to deliver the food and even after contacting the support they are like forcing the customers to cancel their order. I mean why should we cancel our order.,1
No comments. Super execution of the order.,5
Awesome services with good quality of food,5
"Amazing service, i have one request, please also provide the outer pic of restaurant and it's kitchen so that we can take call related to hygeine n all",5
Am ordered food for my guest but order delay From the sun restaurant my guest left am cancelled the order I got call from zomato crm am pressed 1 they told cancle change applicable am agreed but but the msg is we packed order we can't refund Nobody is not informed if you cancel the order we can't refund,1
Pathetic experience. I selected an order and the location of the outlet which was selected was 30 minutes away whereas the nearest one was just 5 minutes. I immediately want to cancel it but they charged 50% of the cost. Please stop ordering from Zomato. Swiggy is way better,1
mind blowing offers. awesome app.,5
Still delivery charge taken separately...not done!,4
This app is awesome 😊everything arrives early!! Happy with it!!,5
Excellent fastest delivery service.,5
The cost is very high for food items compared to hotel and you pay very less to the zomato delivery guy,4
The app has soo many bugs my address is correct in the address line and shows another location in the maps. Soo to change that when i tried to alter it my order got cancelled and the refund wasn't initiated nor there is any contact number so that u can contact them,1
Best food delivery app I ever seen And food is on time,5
Telling people to add more items inorder to take order due to high demand...does the demand decreases if we order more items??,3
"I ordered for full biryani, resturant guy has sent only single biryani, I spoke with the customer care they told sorry for unconvince and favouring me 100 supees compensation. But that's not what I asked, I asked for a order repeat or total refund. While the mistake is from your side and while at the midnight when I was in very hunger you people done to me like this. Such a wonderful service. Very worst service.",1
Worst service got from Zomato..I will never gonna order from Zomato again.. They cancelled the order from their side without my confirmation and also they haven't refunded the money too.,1
Delivery took almost 2 hrs for this much order time taken is too long which is not acceptable,2
Good delivery but more fast need to come,5
"Worst zomoto support, if the restaurant do not respond they screw the customer. I ordered a full chicken of rs 680 and got a small box with 4 pieces of chicken. Zomoto support says, we cannot reach the restaurant so here is 100 for you. But I want my order as we were waiting for the food.",1
Moblie application is very tedious.It is not easy to run.Uber eats was classic application and services was classic.But unfortunatly taken by Zomato.Please will re development mobile application for customers and easy to use.Not will any required more photos in main pages.Picturizaton and presentation very bed in mobile application.,1
So cool app use it all the kind of thing can order from it anytime anywhere ❤️,5
They sent the wrong order again and again...and the only thing they do is apologize and promise for better next time..that is very unprofessional...apologies mean nothing if you cant resolve the issue.,1
"When ordering food from a restaurant after selecting takeaway filter, there's always an option to choose between delivery and takeaway but if placing order from same restaurant by searching their name, there's no takeaway option. You really suck at this. Provide takeaway option when the restaurant is searched by its name.",1
In that condition it's very helpful to everyone,5
"Rice missing from the order, only received two Chole & two plate Bhature. in the morning same order, the driver went to wrong address, then cancelled order, met with driver, he won't hand over food saying it's cancelled because he couldn't find address, then Zomato online Customer Services refused to refund on order NOT delivered, no method to compliant or to retrieve refund for failed delivery. Deeply disappointed, poor service.",1
Food handling is poor.,3
Very bad experience. Charged me fee due to mistake of bot,1
Very Good App. Better Than Any Other App👍🏻. Keep It Up Team@Zomato🙌🏻,5
They sent me ice-cream which was already eaten by someone else. Seal was broken of all cups. Worst service. Delivery boy was not aware of local places.,2
No return options. If somebody orders it by mistake or wantedly they will surely regret it....,1
Average food taste and delivery is earlier the given time,3
Very bad. The app shows restaurants that take orders and gets cancelled. Very bad,1
"The worst delivery and customer service in the UAE, I wish they'd spend as much on their customer service and delivery service as much as they spend on their horrible adverts on social media.",1
Reasonable price of food and also get coupons ❤❤❤,4
Best app and has many offers and coupon deals,5
Fasr delivery and tasty food was delivered by zomato loves it much,5
Prices have got way high... In fact it goes way higher than its actual price,3
Amazing app its fast service and polite rider,5
Very fast delivery excellent,5
There should be an option for cancellation as well,3
"Your this sorry reply over my post isn't helpful at all....your customer support is so bad, all you customer service agent are just making fool of the customers, no refunds are done, no transaction id are shared.",1
Good with delivery timings,5
The recent policy of double order everytime is like a forced torture on customers. It doesn't matter to them that the customer is getting cold food after paying a decent sum. All that matters is profit maximization at any cost..,1
Good food delivery app.,5
Just ridiculous app I can't applying any promocode what's wrong with this app,1
Always take more then the time they provide while delivery. Always provide soggy and smelly food. They loot people's money on behalf of providing food.,1
Delivery Boys are Really Rockzzzz Excellent Service ...,5
Not as good as swiggy especially the way restuarants are managed,2
Zomato is seamless......too good to be true.,5
Very nice and very good service 👍,5
Adding taxes and delivery charges if promo code applied. Bad promotion. 👎,3
Awesome and safe delivery,5
by far the best app for food delivery.,5
Today I ordered pizza from Zomato. It was a buy 1 and get 1 free pizza. From papa Jango's pizza. (but this offer info was mentioned right at the bottom below 100 dishes/ menu). I happened to not see this info and placed order blindly. I received only 1 pizza. While ordering it was still showing buy 1 get free offer applied. upon contacting customer service I was asked to read offer details before ordering. Im feeling cheated by the restraunt and zomato for not prompting me to select two pizzas,1
Very low quality of handling package,1
Offer and promo is very good discount me so enjoyed thank you,5
Good app I always love festive and holidays This app do amazing work,4
Good app. existing offers.good customer service,5
Awesome delivery very nice and quick,5
Very good Service & Very Punctual Delivery Boy,5
"Best offers, every week we are ordering food",5
I literally waited for 3 hours and still my order is not delivered 😔😔 I was working the whole day for my video and u guys treat me like this 👍 Seriously even your customer chat support is horrible they ignored my txt and is still not replying me back. Pathatic service by Zomato,1
I am giving 4 star inlieu of 5 star due to delivery boy named pushpal ghosh with his misbehavior. I set my home location but that person stopped himself at another location which is away of my home location and telling me that he reached my location and continuously blaming me instead of asking or to ascertain to identify the problem. This is unprofessional.,4
I ordered any paid online.After 50 min the executive called me and said that the delivery boy is new and he is not finding the restaurant.so you have to cancel the order and your money will be refunded within 4-5 days. What type of service this is. Are you people playing with us or what,1
"Happy for tasty food according my choice, fast delivery and polite behaviour",5
Good for ordering food. But don't expect free food. This is Zomato not Domino's.,5
very good and good discounts,5
Nice food options at variegated prices...,5
"Good experience, fast delivery",5
This is very good app but charges is very high,4
Satisfied food...😊 Excellent service,5
Their ETA is completely useless. They take double the time to deliver than what they show,1
Excellent app So easy to use...!!!,5
Only one word .... effortless !,5
It was good experience in mysore and just need to call once if the deliver boy does not know or he will call us that's was good,5
I always face issues while paying online please fix this,4
Sometime tasty food deliver...but sometime worst quality of food deliver by Zomato..so kindy request do better service for customer ..for long time survive in market ....,3
Very very clean; fast and delicious👍,5
Worst app too many charges and why the hell i should pay tip to delivery guy who always deliver food late....highly recommend not to use this pathetic app....,1
Not receiving any discount for an specific account whereas there are discount available for the same restaurant on another account and didn't even got any resolution from support team neither on email nor on app chat support. And this is the support provided to a pro members.,1
Easy way to fullfill hunger...✌,4
You should add cash on delivery for all orders not just orders under 350,4
Filtering is very easy,4
I request vegetarians not use this app. As it will not guarantee you that you will get vegetarian food.zomoto will not guarantee you .Here after i think twice to Order food on this app,1
"Thank you, especially to Jubail for processing my order!",5
Mr Akbar was punctual on time and very good behaviour and polite.thank u very much,5
"On pro membership it's charges & increase your bills, no discounts get.",1
"Horrible delivery experience! When something goes wrong at their end, their customer service team is just helpless and useless. Better to go with Uber Eats which focuses on offering a good delivery experience.",1
Perfect app for people who love to eat,5
"Sometimes After ordering we just turn off the screen, and we don't pay attention to the app for like 20-25 minutes. Incase the order gets cancelled from the restaurant, We don't get a proper notification (It notifies on the screen tho) , And after 25 min. u'll be so upset , cuz now u'll have to place the order all over again, So I want them to add a feature like a sound notification or something, it'll be much more convenient for us. And don't force people to order more than they need.",3
Complete cheating. Force users to order above 250rs or 300rs. Zomoto pro ultimate waste. If you order above 300rs then only you will get benifits 🤬 in Zomoto pro.,1
very good service and food!!! wow I like it.....,5
Generally the delivery is on time.,4
"Works reliably. Appreciate the Apple Pay integration on my iPhone. Why is Google Pay option missing on Android phone??? Btw, notifications come first on iphone and then on Android after a while. Keep expanding the restaurants and the deals :)",5
Updates for delivery are not accurate and not in real time. Zomato Pro which was Zomato Gold before was drastically different. Terms were changed mid-contract. Most of the promo codes do not work and it looks like a prevelant issue. Customer service is absolutely horrible. They don't even read through your entire email and give you canned responses that don't answer the questions asked. Utterly disappointing experience.,1
Recently been having a few bugs with the payment process. There's a dip in the promo offers as well. Why isn't there an easier way to check reviews from the place you're ordering from for delivery? edit : please check the menus of the restaurants and with the other apps. While ordering for delivery for several restaurants they have charged extra. It's blatantly cheating their customers. The price of the dish is Rs 20-45 per dish more than the restaurant price while ordering for delivery,1
Absolutely horrible customer care. There's no one you can really talk to in case of any issues. Payment was made and accepted from my account but restaurant says they have not received any order. Trying to get this sorted out with no luck,1
Zomato is losing it. No drivers!!,1
Some items in their menu are nowhere else in town,5
Good service. Prompt delivery.,5
"Very overpriced, I've received actual restaurent bill after delivery and it was 609 INR and on zomato it costs 916 INR and they given a 100 INR off coupon just to show they're giving discounts and which made my order 816 INR including all taxes and delivery charge is only 19 INR so if we see there is still 207 INR difference in actual bill and zomato bill. I don't believe what the heck is that difference and if that difference was just service fee that is still way too much overpriced.",1
Good and timely delivery,5
Moderchd zomato. If I place an order with cash on delivery they bring my food on time if I paid online something always happened ro my order. Delivery guy will say accident happened please cancel the order and will refund..if not they will say no one came to pick the order. This is a scam company.,1
This app is the worst!!! Treating staffs as such slaves also making stupidest agreements with restaurants and I'm not able to have food because of this stupid apps in a proper restaurant .. and of nothing more to say.. about those incidents which happened 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️,1
Best food delivery app for instant delivery,5
Swiggy is much better than you. There is alot of difference in price in zomato and swiggy and i always found zomato provide food as in excess or higher prices ..thats y swiggy is olways on lead noobs.,1
Your app is horrible. I tried to enter delivery address in India and couldn't do it. I have done thru Uber Eats successfully. You screwed things up. I want to see the option of negative stars. I just experienced it with their customer service.,1
Same times cash on delivery is not available,1
Osm platform for fastest food delivery,5
Wrong item delivered and on raising issue they didnt help me properly.,1
I have given 5 star earlier but after getting the pro subscription service got worse. Even sharing the picture of fungysed food I have not received the proper resolution. Even the representative named Bikash was not coperative. I don't want to give this one star as well,1
Superb. Service is excellent,5
The App never allowed me to enter a promotion code. It took me directly to the payment page where there was no option to enter the code. It made me lose money,2
"I ordered a veg meal and was delivered a non veg meal full of non veg pieces. Buyers beware. You dont know what will be delivered to you. Worst, you have to ask for a refund without which it does not even have the basic courtsey to provide refund.",1
Awesome. Ordering is a breeze. Good job,5
"Complete rip off, cancelled my order placed online with reason delivery guy was there but I didn't answer the phone, no one called me. charged me full amount as cancellation fees. Uninstalling the app with great disappointment",1
Best app to save money and receive valuable service,5
"Extremely poor customer service experience. How worse can it get when the executive tells you ""maam please treat this incident as a isolated incident and forget about it"" ? The delivery boy couldnt contact me (I received no calls, btw) and he cancelled my order. But I was still charged!",1
"Such poor service was not expected. Improve yourselves and provide a number so that the consumer can do a Complain, who does not know English how will the message?",1
Pathetic customer support. Discount coupon did not apply and customer support does not have any answer except saying treat the bug as an exception! I will use Swiggy for sure going forward,1
"I like their delivery on time offer and that's why I prefer it over Swiggy. And also, it is good to know that they do not penalize drivers for delay happening which is beyond their control.",5
"Awful... ordered food through Zomato .. delivery person mentioned that he is outside but there is none , and worst i am chatting with support and they promised instructions are passed but order is canceled with no refund.",1
Offer cupons are absolutely phenomenal.. Maintaining the international standards on fast delivery and online tracking. This is my first and best experiance..,5
Good food delivery experience. Only thing missing is that the map to track the order is not accurate sometimes,5
Very good food delivery app for the Kochi area. Prompt reliable service.,5
"Wasnt really easy to use, no delivery options and no menus were loading. Pretty dissapointed.",1
Very happy with the dev team for this flawless app,5
Please don't use this app. I was a regular user and even advocated this app over their competitors (cough cough Swiggy) but after the N'th time they cancelled my order with absolutely no explanation or reason I've been compelled to write this review and hope others don't waste their time on this app.,1
"I have used Zomato almost daily for the last year, and have been very satisfied with the overall quality of the service.",5
"Zomato helps me order quality food pretty easily. Food and restaurant ratings are really good, it helps in decision making. It",4
Nice application and lots of apply codes. Thank for Zomato☺️☺️,5
Worst chat support. Didn't allow me to reply.,2
Horrible filter. Searched ethic cuisines in my area and several places I know didn't show up. Disappointing.,2
Awful. Gets stuck and can't order food on time. Please fix it.,1
Worst I didn't see any benefit using this app in ordering food online,1
Payment did not go through until I reinstalled app. Address was marked as invalid until I reinstalled app.,3
"Was terribly busy, skipped lunch, and ordered food from Home Chef, Hebbal, Bangalore around midnight with Zomato. Restaurant clearly mentioned that the delivery guy took the food but it never arrived, he switched off the phone after picking food. Worst part is how the chat assistant Anushua keeps talking like a bot, just pasting content around. Make them understand the meaning of hunger.",1
"no help at all from the customer care centre, inefficient and careless. Zomato is literally the worst, they misinform and lie to their customers. Also everyone is giving 1 star rating how are they 4?? Fake fake fake",1
Good for delivery or pickup. Get Zomato pro for great discounts. Easy to use.,5
Best place order food. Zomato is really a nice place to order food. I think this platform is best place for feedback,5
"Complicated to order, Zoomato increase prices at the time of delivery.",2
Great Value & Smooth Delivery,5
"We Always order from this app, it's easy and works well.",5
Ordered food and never received. Chat waiting time is 15 mins. Basically a third class app,1
Tips I will pay the tip when the restaurant confirms that they will match the tip. Why are you making this my problem when you are earning money from this ?,1
You order for a certain amount...and for some reason you cancel the order...the refund amount is partially given back... Promocode technique is biggest scam Being a gold member no use ...,1
"Unprofessional, inefficient, trick consumers to promotions that they do not honour! A buy 1 get 1 offer on that was only delivers a buy 1.. the get 1 has been refused to be delivered by the restaurant. What is worse, that Zomato wasn't able to enforce this promo with the store! Great incompetence",1
"Not only was my order not delivered with the correct items, but someone purposely packed one of the pastries sideways which completely smashed it! I called the delivery guy who had just left my house and he said he'd delivered what the cake shop gave him. I tried calling the cake shop Le Quatre but was midnight so they understandably didn't answer. I wrote a complaint to Zomato, and 20 hours later I'm told that Le Quatre admits they made an error but decline to refund my money. WTH?",1
Food delivery on time..Hassle free order..great job..thank you.,4
Cant add payment type or order delivery so this app is almost useless! 🍻,2
very cheap and very bad even i can cook better,1
Bhai ek number Khana the food is dope and even in 200 RS you will feel like you are the richest person. Everything is so reasonable cheep you can buy it all and it's always crowded and no parking for car bike can manage to sneak in,5
Very good but should not make demand rates making customers to spend more,5
Very nice and fast,5
My order didn't go through and there was no one available on the chat to resolve my case. Please be more responsive.,1
Charges are too high,2
Worst cuatomer support on chat and email. Wasted a lot of time using this app. I prefer to use Swiggy even if I lose 1 year pro membership.,1
Customer care is pathetic and if things go bad they make you wait for more than an hour and also lacks professionalism. They handle cases so badly that I now always prefer swiggy over Zomato even if it involves paying 20-30 rs extra. How can they mess up my order with some order from Another restaurant???,1
The order picked up at restaurant but it was linked with others order which was delayed,1
"For 20minutes it says it order in 3 mins but vallet in some other place ,if he can't come why he pickup my food order after it get cold wat is use of ordering and I'm also very Hungry at that time no response from Zomato I raised complaint no one take it seriously, worst experience from Zomato",1
"Like the pro membership, worth for money for frequent orders..",5
Allows international card and number unlike swiggy. I can now order food for my parents in india from United States,5
"fraud service. if there is a possibility i would like to give it zero stars or less. exploring and fooling people. they even manipulate the actual restro pricing and cheat people with higher pricing... Both the service and the app, both are buggy.. they don't deliver the food but mark it as delivered. When we call they say sorry for inconvenience we are learning with this experience.. are we here to pay and also teach you.. better shut the business and go to school first.",1
Worst app ever...wrong order delivery and no response from the support,1
Uninstalling Zomato Will install it again when the poor delivery boy will get his job back Hire him back ASAP,1
Food is good but delivery boy was looking very dirty,3
I'm giving only 3 star because the man who dilever he came 10 minutes late,3
"Zomato should have chat place for us to even tell on words .. for the wrong order I received which I don't want to eat. They were trying to give me back 28 rupees credit. How can a Veg fried rice worth 220+ with delievery charges , taxes is equal to rupees 28. Fortunately, I called up restaurant and todl thrm what happened and cleared it with them and solved issue by oursleves . Somehow loosing customer support from Zomato.",1
Please stop those marketing unreal offers. We always get better deals on other platforms.,1
Pro is only good while dining out. But corona.. And delivery is filled with taxes.,3
Quick service and great offer's,5
Love the bounty kunafa. The saffron sweet sauce is nice - adds amazing taste to the kunafas!,5
"I ordered from kFC , Zomato had an option of ontime or free, I opted in for that. The delivery was supposed to happen in 35 mins, at 30 min mark customer representative calls me to inform that my order was never picked up by the restaurant and because of which they have to cancel my order. It had even allocated a delivery partner to the restaurant, now they gave me a coupon for Rs 100, while with the ontime scheme they promised to pay Rs 200. Why promote a scheme if you don't honor it?",1
"Quality of service is going down. Started using swiggy more than zomato now. Some of the things noticed: 1. Most Offers are applicable only for orders above 599 or are tied to specific cards. 2. Delivery charges have fone up, in some cases, a Rs.30 delivery charge has gone up to Rs.70. 3. Asking users to order more to be eligible to place an order. 4. Even zomato pro is a fad. Prices of items are hiked for pro orders. 5. Taking all these into consideration, Swiggy seems to be a better option.",1
Nicevn quick delivery with efficient staff. Very happy.,5
Order is too late... Its getting to 1hr,1
Terrible service. Serious bugs where order fails. You find out after waiting an hour for your food. Customer support doesn't even bother addressing it. Not wasting a penny on them again. It's only as convenient as it is reliable... And it's not,1
Very good app easy to order,5
Good easy to use and customer care response is also nice . Good app for a lazy person like me who want to eat alot,4
"They are now just adding almost any or every restaurant. Even if you send them proof showing how pathetic the food is being served to the customer, The only option they have is a ""coupon"". If you want to cater people atleast make sure you adding restaurant which are delivering food which one can atleast eat rather than throwing. Even though their own rep said he won't eat such thing but anyways I got a coupon after spending money and eating crappy food",1
Best food delivery app,5
Amazing app looking forward for more,5
Ok customer care can be better..,2
Bad user interface and bad categorized,3
"Why you give every single add forcefully, m a vegetarian and have to see chicken ad and so. Atleast I can expect some kind of sentiments value done by zomato. Its so frustrating to see same ads repeatedly and tht is to non veg. So does tht mean zomato doesn't consider any sentiment values",1
Very shocking experience. I ordered through zomato app paying delivery charges around Rs 63 but order is also not been tracked from zomato app nor the delivery was been given by zomato people. The delivery was given directly to me from that specific resturant. Than for what reason i paid to zomato delivery charges. I could have directly called the resturant to place the order i would have not been charged any delivery charges. Isn't this being fraud activity to take out the money. Cheap move.,1
This app used to be useful. It is trash now. In it's pursuit of simplicity it has taken away so much functionality it's no longer useful and just frustrating. I hate it.,1
Easy and reliable,5
The delivery guy argues with me calling me from away location from my home and refuses to deliver at gate no1 at Nandigarden 1 gate gate no1 ask me to go to phase2 to collect the order. Hopeless service.,2
"The app is good, but zomato delivery itself is terrible. I try it once every few months since I like the ability to tip on the app. But they inevitably bungle up the delivery and I shift back to good old reliable talabat",2
Had to try many times to place order this time.,3
Happy with this app ☺️. My other family members also prefer this app for their hungry tummy 😝,4
Look into the matter of Kamaraj your delivery boy he is innocent and the girl is fake your every delivery boy is very gentle,1
Nice app good delivery,5
"Very very very worst support as well as the app. If we place an order, the restaurant will accept the order and later told us to cancel the order. We have to cancel the order without getting the refund amount. What a business logic... don't choose this app.. very very worst...I chatted with support multiple times, they told to wait for 7 days. If i ask the status, they will simply say as per our rule, they will not give you the money...once again it's not yours... I believe most of the user would have faced this issue.",1
"Well I understand that the app is just like a middleman between us and the restaurants. So basically restaurants would be doing all the work. But as a customer of such plateform I would expect to get at leat a call when my orders are cancelled. I spent an hour waiting for my order. I found out that my ordered was cancelled for some reason through the app. At least give me a call so I won't keep waiting. Also there is no option to add special request, which is lame.",1
"This app is useful for ordering food when the order arrives right. However, if there is an issue with your order, then the customer service will do nothing to help you. Their customer service people are so impatient that they can't even wait for you to type they will end chat after ten seconds of inactivity. I'm a very fast type but apparently not fast enough for Zomato's customer service agents. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this app, or you will regret it if you ever have an issue.",1
"App keeps crashing. ""Something went wrong. Please try again"" keeps popping up all the time. Tried on multiple users account but everyone gets the same error. This has happened multiple times and various occasions. Someone really needs to work on this. Disappointing. No wonder my friends recommend other similar competitor Apps to use.",1
"A lot of issues ordering food with this app. When I've had issues, they spent hours apologizing and saying ""give me some time to solve this"" while I'm still sitting with the wrong orders. They promised me refunds that were incomplete or did not come. Abu Dhabi has too many delivery options to deal with the frustration that comes with using Zomato. It would be easier to go to the restaurants myself.",1
I want to order food since last 4 days but I can't able to order because in this app show that all restaurants are closed but in swiggy same restaurants.,1
"There is no way to get reimbursed for a mistaken order. The only option was to cancel the order and still payed a high fee (about 50% of the order total). UPDATE today is already a week after and I have not received any reimbursement for this order, even if I agreed to pay for the penalty. The app says it was reimbursed but my bank says otherwise. Very bad service and company. Don't use your cards on this. They are liars at Zomato",1
"The best part about this app, which I found out just now it's that even though you never receive your order, it just auto update itself after 3 hours saying that you received your order and submits your money to the restaurant. I would suggest everyone to never ever pay upfront when using this app. you will lose your money and also not get your order.",1
"At my location it was claiming locations to be open that aren't even there anymore (building was fully demolished and a small news story was published in our local news paper about shutting down) or are closed for the entire season. Maybe it will be useful for you the reader of this comment, but for myself it is not of any use to me. That is why I rated it 1 star.",1
Customer service is very poor nd price are too high they are charging 100 to 150 rs extra on they original price from restaurant price pls mind that if we give complaint about charging more price that is 100 to 150rs u will have to pay fine in court,1
"Sometimes the restaurant sends food very late or wrong items. I don't like to complain about it all the time unless it's really bad. Every time I try to explain Zomato this all they say is I'm sorry it would not happen again. But it does happen again and again. I don't want the refund but I want my food to be replaced. Still, I don't get any help. So I started to use Swiggy more and asking my friends to do that. Zomato will lose customers if they don't change their rules. Customers are always ri",3
On time delivery,4
"Very disappointed with their delivery/distance estimation system. They deduct your money, auto accept the order on behalf of restaurants only to later receive calls from their restaurants that they won't be delivering to a specific location. It has happened with me more than I can imagine and almost everytime I order food from them. Their refunds are not processed in time and you have to reach out to their chat support which is next to no response always. Not customer friendly at all!",1
An app that shows discount and shamelessly increases prices in the menu. I have been ordering from a restaurant since lockdown. Today I noticed 50% discount and opened to check the menu. I was stunned to see prices increased by 50-80%. The fact that they also charge delivery fee for delivery shows just how disgusting and pathetic they are. They loot the restaurant people by taking huge percentage as commission even during covid-19 and also loot the general public. Disgusting! Have some shame!,1
"This app is great for delivery as long as the restaurant sends the correct order. If the order is messed up (happened to me 3 times out of 6), there's no customer service. The app asks you to email customers support and when you do (like me), there's a standard reply and no action. They just ask you to rate down the restaurant or the item which was wrong. Very poor customer service experience. I wouldn't use zomato unless really necessary to get delivery",3
"While Zomato used to provide quality service with a clean, easy to use and smooth interface, it now seems to be in serious cost cutting mode. Erroneous deliveries are ignored by the customer service team and the app now forces customers to complain about poor service via email instead of chat. Even then, despite promises of a 24 hour delivery window those promises are not kept. I do not plan on using Zomato in the near future until this is fixed.",1
"Not always accurate in information and customer support is lacking. Would not use app if it was not necessary for ordering from some restaurants in the area. Additionally, it's annoying to have the drivers and restaurants call for nearly every order I place for unnecessary reasons. My orders are very simple and selections do not have any customizations, just make the item I ordered.",1
"I liked the app till yesterday... As of today, there are only 41 restaurants that deliver to my area but sadly, it doesn't include the ones with a 10 km radius... Why? I can't even order from the places I have ordered before because the app says ""does not deliver to your location"" (even if it's practically next door)! Not sure what happened with the latest update, but if it continues, I will delete my account and unistall the app... Luckily there are other delivery apps out there.",1
"Very Frustrating service from Zomato, after making pickup order from it get confirmation and status is showing preparing and when i went there to pickup the order at the restaurant they said we are not aware of such order and want more time to prepare it, i cancelled the order because i didn't had much time for that but Zomato denied to refund money and said you have to pick that order in anyway. is this there service? i'm uninstalling his app and will not order from here in life time. I think people should see the recent reviews before making any order here. if i saw that i'll not order it. they are making just fool to us.",1
"The reason why we use these kind of apps is to communicate less with the restaurant and experience an easy food delivery service. I've really enjoyed using this app for almost 3 years. But unfortunately, the level of professionalism got very low and i faced couple of issues with my orders recently for the lack of professionalism, especially when it comes to order trackings. I've officially deleted my account today because it gotten very upsetting due to having repetitive issues.",1
"I would recommend Uber Eats or Deliveroo (if you are in UAE) than Zomatoo and I will tell you why. I placed an order and was told that it will take an hour to arrive, fine. But it took 1hr and 30mins for the food to be delivered. I contacted Zomato through their chat but no help at all. They tried to call the resto but not picking up and that's it. No further help. I don't normally leave a feedback but since I was so upset waiting for my order, I decided to write a review.",1
When ordering from a chain restaurant you should be able to select what one you care to order from. I have a subway close to my residence and it is horrible and makes me ill nearly everytime I eat there. I'd like the option of ordering from the next closest one and paying an increased delivery fee if needed. Additionally the map routing needs to be updated because it doesn't work well. I put in my address and the map tries to have the driver deliver to the building behind mine leading to calling,2
The First time i ordered the service was great but the next time i ordered my order is delayed for more than 30 mins there was no live tracking available so i called the restaurant and he has no idea of the order. This is very degrading. I don't know if this is the restaurants fault as the delivery is done by Zomato. Maybe the food was cooked late or there was no delivery available !,3
"HATE THIS FREAKING APP!!! Their customer service is honestly the worst. I paid for meals and they refuse to give me compensation for their mistakes. My issue isn't solved. I'm basically being told to wait and be patient. If their messaging system has automated responses to the issues, it says a lot about them as a company. don't give them a freaking dime people. for a week or so they will be reliable and then they flop. I'm so pissed off and you won't be able to comprehend how livid I am.",1
"Its used to be a good app. But these days orders are often really late or even being canceled for no reason and customer service doesn't do anything to make up for it. Customer agents are useless at zomato chat and unhelpful. When they cancel your order they blame the restaurant, the restaurant blames Zomato and you as a customer offered to get your food only if you pay again and the refund for the order they cancelled by mistake won't reach your account before 7 days. I won't use it again.",1
"A monopolistic way of functioning. The food does not get delivered in full, half the time. You are forced to pay. They give zomato credits as an apology which unusable. The customer service is also completely useless. In effect you end up paying more in delivery charge and undelivered order and force you to buy something next time as with a small zomato credit. Very poor. These guys need more competition to wipe them away. And it will happen as such poor business practices are never sustainable.",1
"App doesn't show you full options. Chat support is useless. Zomato doesnt forward special requests to the restaurants. i categorically mentioned foe the order to be delivered at a cwrtain time. They did not forward my request and order was returned, and audacity is that i did not get any refund. Second time around, the coupon code was not accepted, although it showed to be valid in the begining. Once again, chat support was utterly useless and Zomato contact number is impossible to reach.",1
"Terrible customer service. The only reason I renewed my gold subscription was to avail the Black Friday deal of receiving 75 zomato credits. I didn't realize there was a code that had to be included until I searched online as to why I couldn't see the credits. Support chat was not helpful at all. This is ridiculous, I certainly will not recommend gold to others.",1
"Have used this app for several years and was always my favorite but now it is a pain to use. First all distances are in km. Second when I search for restaurants I get about 20 ranging from 7.5 km to 60 km arranged in no particular order. Third if I try to sort by distance the list is reduced to 2 restaurants, one at 7.5 km and one at 20 km. Fourth I know there are many more restaurants within 15 km that are not listed.",3
"UPDATE: CAREFUL! the application for some restaurants will charge you for money when selecting your beverage when ordering a Meal!! Happened with McDonald's! Although the application is good and well built, but it seems that the area and address selector is dumb. I live in tawoon and it says that most restaurants can't deliver there. On the other hand, when i order from another application like Talabat for example, i always get my order. They need to fix this if they want to stay in business",1
"Am I missing something? There's no option to order food in the app or schedule delivery. I told customer service about it and I think there was a serious language barrier as they werent understanding anything I was saying and left it off with ""email me screenshots of the issue and we'll fix it"" and I did and havent heard anything back from them. If you can't actually order and can just see resturaunt info you may as well download yelp since the application is 100x better...",1
"Sometimes there is too much information floating around in the app and it could lead you to believe you're choosing something to eat from a place that delivers when they actually don't. It is a nice feature to show what is around even if they don't deliver, but find a way to separate the delivering restaurants from the no delivery ones. Do that and this app is 5 stars.",4
"Very disappointed with the way Zomato treat customer issues. Unfortunately due to some network issue my phone was out of network coverage area and couldn't attend the delivery agents call. It was not even a minute when I saw the missed call and called back but he didnt respond. Zomato cancelled my order and refused the refund too! I use to use Zomato quite often, gave them good business, but this was a very disappointing experience. I no more trust them and uninstalled the app.",1
"my girlfriend and I used to love this app. we used it exclusively when we traveled. we would simply hit the ""near by"" and find all sorts of places near to where we were traveling. you took that option away. now we have to be specific in what we are looking for. we are traveling, in a new place, we dont want to be specific. WE WANT TO EXPLORE",2
Huge issue as you can't cancel orders and restaurants can stop taking orders anytime. If you've just ordered and want to order again as you've forgotten something OR the restaurant runs out of food so you'd rather cancel and order the full larger quantity from another restaurant - can't do it. Customer service is unintelligent. Further - Limit on cash on delivery makes no sense- release the limit for regular users or customers who spend more than a certain amount. Eg 5000 a month .,2
"Our food came 40 minutes after it was suppose to and was cold and uneditable. Your app has a ""Call"" button associated with each order. We used that to complain and they said they would send it again and rush it. An hour later we still didn't have our food so I called again and they said the restaurant would call us. Found your chat on the app and they REFUSED to refund what we paid for our order. Luckily the restaurant manager called and he picked up the cold food and refunded us as you wouldn't",1
"It's the second time they let me down. Once they just cancelled my order after 1 hour waiting while i was tracking it down my place and expecting someone knock the door and just said it was restaurant fault (why they were showing the tracking to my place then ). And now with Gold membership which is so tricky, cause I subscribed thinking i can use for my next orders which turns to be dine in only though later they emailed and said can be used for delivery but now turned out not available in UAE.",1
"I am extremely dissappointed with Zomato app and the services rendered by its support department. Due to app's error, an order of mine was ordered twice in a span of one minute! YES! REPEAT ORDER within one minute and money got deducted from my paytm without my knowledge! The repeat order got delivered at home in my absence! At that time, my mother-in-law didnt know that it was an exact same order!! I WAS READY TO RETURN THE ORDER BuT WAS TOLD THAT NOTHING CAN BE DONE AND YOUR MONEY CANNOT BE RETURNED! THIS IS SO not fair! Thats how Zomato treat its loyal customers by snatching their hard-earned money from them through their error-prone app! This very sad! I will not use Zomato again!",1
Howsoever I tried there were problems. I got doesnt deliver to your location when the restaurant actually does. Too many offers but most are upto x% and they also dont get applied properly . Customer service sucks big time with too many emails but nobody actually looking at the said problem. Just too time consuming in every sense.,2
"Absolutely terrible customer service, they dont know how to communicate with their customers, take more than 10 days if you have an issue, complacent as hell, sloths are even better, just to let you know i was a gold membership holder, strongly advice not to use this platform! Its been more than 11 days for me, even after which they dont have freaking solution to my problem Very bad N terrible experience! This company day robs your money with excellent deception skills....BEWARE BEWARE",1
"Made an order, it never got delivered and I receieved a mail saying delivery completed. When the issue was raised they claim they contacted me and since I was not answering calls, my delivery was cancelled and no amount would be refunded. But the fact is, I was never contacted. Such is their service- any excuse to fleece the customer. Try at your own risk, I lost money in the process.",1
"despite the reviews I decided to try the app out to maybe order breakfast or browse the restaurants they work with, I clicked on a few restaurants, they didn't have a menu and the link to their website was bad. When I tried to possibly order something I couldn't figure out how. The menu was on the front page but when I clicked the menu it said no menu has been added yet, typically when I want to order food I need a menu to look at in order to do so.",1
"Don't order anything from this app, they are accepting order and after 40 minutes they are cancelling the order. Waste of time and they don't know how to deal with a customer. Pathetic app. Zero star for customer service. No option to contact customer support, chat option is useless. Don't want to recommend this app to anyone in this planet.",1
"No customer service. No phone number to call, only their horrible chat system... Furthermore, They scam you out of promotional codes which they promise to give you as a refund method and they do not. It's the worst App I have ever used for foid delivery. I will not use again, and I advise against using it. Steer clear from this mediocre App and be aware of their fraudulent activities and false promises.",1
"I love zomato customer service, they really value the customer. Thanks",5
"Terrible experience with the zomato support. Not having a customer support is awful. The chat boat is not at all functional. Giving 3 stars for providing the opportunity to order online and get food when in need. Also, it creates a lot of jobs to the local people.",3
"I'd recommend to avoid this app to order food. Extremely poor experience. Received bad food and they do partial refunds, the customer service, the reps deliver random promises to get off the cust service call. There is a limit to being patient, felt like I was haggling and just let it be 😅. Fair warning",1
"I placed an order & real time for delivering an order was given in app but neither i received the order on given time nor I was inform about any late delivery.I personally visited the outlet to know about my delivery nearly at midnight.Very bad experience i had on my first order itself.For sure i won't use it again & ask my friends, relatives not to refer....!!! It's my personal request/suggestions to please start availing the mobile number of delivering person so we can contact him/her.",1
placed an order was charged for it. the website kept saying payment not processed. called the number no answer. tried the chat for 1hr 45mins no response. what kind of customer service is this. i gave up go and reorder the food at the restaurant pick it up come home. 2 hours later your orser has been accepted its on its way. yried to cancel agian no way to contact them.,1
"Worst ever food ordering experience compared to all apps. Doesn't care about customer feelings at all. Zomato feels that paying Rs.75 for the delay and cold food is very much user pleasing. First, they show a delivery time of 35 mins at the time of order. Second, instruct the valet for a batch delivery which obviously delays your order sometimes more than an hour. Third, the very much caring customer care blames it on the rider and offers a 75 promo code as if it will make you joyful! Ridiculous",1
"The update sucks! I can't find any of the restaurants that I used to find easily, there are no menus, sometimes they say that the restaurant ""isn't delivering at the moment"" but when I called the place they said that delivery was still available.",2
"The location naming when pinpointing your area is completely off and has nothing to do with where I am. And when i end up ordering food and they call me for the exact location, they tell me ""sorry sir that's a different location and we can't deliver there."" fix your application please. Thanks.",1
"Never going to order from here or recommend anyone to use this fraud of an app with horrible customer service. I had made an order which was never delivered and the customer service kept asking me to wait, over 3 hours. I never received the food and the whole family was disappointed and had to sleep hungry. They said the refund was initiated but I never received it and my EMAILS* were ignored, due to that I'm having to write this review. I have so much to say but running out of space. 0 stars.",1
This app and service are becoming a complete disaster. Last time I ordered the driver didn't show up and an hour and half to pick up the order from the restaurant and this order they withdrew from the card but the restaurant didn't even receive the order. They do these offer ls that they can't fulfill properly. Last time I'm using zomato what's the point of using an app if I have to call 10 times and chat wj their customer support that doesn't even answer.,2
"I only used zomato before, I will say its fair service in general. Sometime food wasnt that good, I left comment, no respond, I don't really mind that. Recently I delete my saved card details for security reason, when I order food and key in card details manually, my cards all declined. No answer for customer service call. With no choice, I tried using other good delivery apps, realize othet have better offer than zomato. When I feedback by leaving comment, no response as usual. Dissapointed.",1
first order was horrible.. they est. 25-35 min. i stopped at 1 hr and ordered more food told them to cancel order.. they pushed on and asked me to wait a few more minutes but i had time to walk across the street and order food and bring it back before the driver got here. 1hr 20 min. said something about maps before i shut the door.,1
"After using this service for a while, I decided to delete this app and move to other service. I was expecting that they stood by customers offering fair resolution. Even after showing the pictures and proving that the order was incorrectly delivered they failed to initiate a refund in respect of fairness and pushed me to accept a credit voucher for 'inconvenience'. Time is more valuable and its not about $8 ‐ $10 only. When customers don't get what they ordered they shouldn' be made to pay.",1
Why Cash on Delivery not supported,1
"Took me 17 minutes to get my sandwich and it was wrong. The ingredients were listed on the kitchen ticket. It should not be that hard. only 1 person taking orders and making sandwiches, other back in kitchen. And the lady up front just kept taking orders, but no one was making them. I won't come back.",2
"When searching for restaurants in my town, even after listing my location mulitple times and other towns surrounding me, it said i was in a major city nore than 30 minutes away. Small town well rated places that i know of, and that friends/family suggest, don't come up at all. I was hoping for an experience that would suggest not only the major chains or popular restaurants, but even the smaller family run businesses.",2
"First you made it hard to just search for a place to eat, and now you removed the map view, the best feature in the app. place names means nothing to me. I need a visual. I wish app developers would stop removing their map views....... One star rating because I dug around the app for a lot of wasted time looking for the map view, and I assume you either buried it so much that it's not found easy or removed it completely.",1
its always good amazing and super convenient but some restaurant's really bad. just taking Zomato down . Zomato needs to start working on it. which restaurant doens't give good performance regarding food n delivery just stop displaying them on your page. basically my recent order just give me real hard time to get my food. i was starving and delivery guy were just more messing it up . calling again and again still going on wrong address even i also called him several times. but overall amazing.,5
would never order from this app as they have come up with a new policy called food wastage where they simply ensure once u place ur order it can not be altered as non of the support teams will respond till the rider reaches ur destination .I placed an order by mistake for veg combo instead of non veg an immediately tried all possible ways to rectify it ...I know food cannot be wasted but we should be able to rectify our mistake at least with 5 to 10 mins time frame from the order being placed ..,1
"I like the previous build better. Zomato was very useful to search restaurants in a restricted place for a example a mall or office building. Now it's nearly impossible and crowded with places beyond my walking distance. Previously you can just input null in the search field and it will return any restaurant, now you have to insert something and restricting your selection.",2
order gets cancelled after waiting for 30 min. your careless customer care says that it is the issue with restaurant but not with us. if the restaurant is unreliable why was it in the list? restaurant is closed but you will still accept the orders and blame restaurant. finally the customer is suffering. worst service.,1
"I now remember why I uninstalled this app the last time. I can't stand it. It's like their algorithm can't actually do math. A restaurant where 30% of the reviews are negative gets a 4.1, putting it above other local restaurants that received nothing but 5 star reviews but somehow only have Zomato ratings of 2.9 and 3.3. Instead of these places where everyone loves the food and service Zomato wants us to eat instead at the place where 1/3 of customers have a negative experience?",1
They are allowing fake orders from restaurants that are not subscribed to their service. My order was cancelled and I'm waiting for a supposed refund. I had to ask them to refund immediately since I read they keep some users' money for MONTHS. This sounds like unfair business practice that I warned them will be carried to court if they don't return my money. Disappointed.,1
"I made an order to Sumi sushi two hours ago and still waiting. Payment was processed at 8:52 pm and am very dissapointed because it is 10:40 pm, now. Zomato indicated it would take 36 minutes when I placed order. I am expecting a full refund! Poor coordination between Zomato and Sumi Sushi. Have not heard back from Zomato?",1
I have never seen such a lousy app in my life! it is frustrating! I literally couldn't control my anger at the number of times your application hung up on me. literally hanging and freezing all the time. I didn't want to eat at all! Your app made me struggle so much.,1
"Bad service, very slow. Slow enough to the point to where my food was basically refrigerated when I received it. the two times I used it I had disgusting people deliver my food. Chest hair popping out of their shirt, more chins than I can count and sweating(smelled so bad). I'll stick the Doordash and GrubHub.",1
"The latest update broke the app. I can't search for restaurants, it always return nothing found and if it works once I can only order but not see the menu. Do you test it before release? Please revert back to the old stable version. Thanks!",2
great food at La Mission but not sure how important customers are. as we were dining I noticed an elderly lady on the floor. I notified the staff. my retired ER wife was helping. the staff was very inattentive to the situation. the only thing they did was ask if they needed to call 911 which was denied. the lady was on the floor for 20 min. no appreciation was shown in any manner to my wife's help. it was just business as usual to them. I'm very disappointed. we are regular customers. maybe,4
"Google Play prompted me to install the Zomato after i tapped on the menu of a restaurant from the android Chrome browser. I followed the suggestion and installed the app on my phone. After the app is installed ask me to sign in or enter as a guest. I did the latter. Then it just displayed a blank screen instead of the menu page that I was looking for for the restaurant I was looking at. I was expecting to see the page of the restaurant menu I was trying to open. Suggestion to zomato, see if you can offer the option of opening the restaurant menu from my browser instead of the app",2
"1 star less, bcz u need a better app developer team to meet the people's demand. There are many bugs in your app for Android. I think u should give stable updates rather updating frequently.",4
"There are 2 instances in 5 dyata where the order is cancelled. They cancelled my dinner offer after 32 minutes of placing the order with no apology. Support team is worst. When I contacted them they didn't respond immediately. Later, they just said this won't not repeat again and didn't answer my other questions. I'm a good customer and not going to renew it anymore, it's useless.",1
The orders contain less food than what I would expect in the restaurant. Overall app however is good. And the service so far has also been good. Issues are resolved at all times. However sometimes issue resolution took almost an hour. But they have been resolved correctly.,4
Worst app. Customer care cancellation of order without informing. And deduct cancellation amount for customer care goofup. The restaurant and Zomato never get through each other. We get endless calls instead of food and they ask same info again and again. Worst customer care rude behaviour. I have stopped using this app. Dunzo is best.,1
Good most of the times. Ordered for a friend's dad in another city.Guy kept on floor took a photo ran away. It was not right address. He is not picking up phone. Customer service Padmini is useless as she herself could not connect to delivery guy. As there is a photo its considered delivered. Not looking for a refund but let him call and say where he kept? Question i told the guy to wait and let my aunt come to door. Floor looks different,1
very user friendly!!!! Love the UX they offer in the application and the service is great,5
the application created by Zomato doesn't have rigth check and validations. i had ordered food and by mistake i chose the wrong quantity. i immediately cancelled the order and the application allowed to do so even when the order was accyby the restaurant. i reordered it with right quantity. they didn't refund the money fir the first cancelled and i did nit even received the food. whereas the app should not have allowed me to cancel it.,1
"Way better than For Square. However, doesn't seem to know what ""near me"" is suggesting/listing restaurants 10 miles or more away as in the neighborhood. Also will give you a dozen results for the same restaurants (different locations) as if the closest one wasn't enough. Iffy price results base on user inputs? with some rather pricy eats being listed as cheap ""$-$$""",2
"Great App, especially with the new features where I can toggle so easily between my orders from multiple places. Although I would be more happy if I get a notification of a restaurant is closing online ordering while I am adding items to my cart from that restaurant. Currently only during the payment it is notified and I was really disappointed as it took me a really long time to decide and I had to do over",4
"My meal was 2 hours late tonight. My very first order, two months ago, with Zomato was never delivered while showing in the tracking system that it was already delivered. I had to call the restaurant, the guy on the phone told me your order is here but the delivery guy didn't show up. They had to send me my order through the restaurant's driver after waiting around 2 hours and a half. The food was damaged and smelling weird when arrived.",1
"the app is a bit buggy as my main ""order food"" tab has a perpetual message that something has gone wrong, so I've had to manually search for restaurants and order food that way. This issue has gone unresolved by app folks so that's a bit frustrating. Overall though, the app makes ordering food pretty easy despite some restaurants charging steep ""packaging fees"".",3
"Pathetic service. First of all, do not order anything from domino's through zomato. They don't track delivery of domino's. Plain and simple. Domino's restaurants do not pick calls. Do not prepay in any case. It is the only insurance.",1
I have been charged for my order but it is showing payment failure...when i chat with your support team they told it is because of some technical issue you will get reverse your amount in 4-5business days .i dont have any money now to eat anything...you are a fraud company..you support team told me you dont have customor care number...,1
zomato updates are fundamental and you get lost... i tried to find comments box for my order and i couldnt find it which resulted in wrong order...i called the restaurant immediately after placing my order na dthey didnt pick up and i called after 5 minutes and they said they already prepared the wrong order...thanks zomato for making your up more stupid...,1
The automatic chat support is just an excuse for ignoring customer complaints I bought some food and messaged them about some items missing. The chat bot said they'll look into it but I never got a reply and the only thing I can do about it is to start a whole new thread just for them to ignore it again. Thanks but no thanks,1
"Its bad enough that the app does not show expected delivery time when ordering. But when you decide to cancel an order after you're tired of waiting, you cant do that with the restaurant and Zomato support does not answer.",1
Very much improved app with simple to do task for ordering food,4
I use to use zomato almost exclusively. I've now swapped to deliveroo in the uae. The latest update makes you watch an add prior to browsing resteraunts. You have to buy their premium zomato gold to skip the add. Too many delivery options out there that I dont have to deal with incoviences like this.,2
The offers and the number of restaurants on the platform are good. I've booked so many meals I can't even imagine that I did that. UI is slightly unintuitive. Would love some more filters.,4
"very bad. I placed the order for dinner nd after 30 minutes I came to know tht the restaurant is not working from last 1 month. whereas on app I was getting updates like order accepted, food is being prepared etc. Then I got call from zomato but the person couldn't explain things properly. Also that person on call was very rude nd disconnected the call when I was talking. This was very insulting. Zomato should update The current status of hotels.",2
"it's not the first time this has happened, restaurants don't accept the order automatically, pick up agent doesn't find the place, and restaurant phone is switched off..wow great! Cherry on the cake is huge volume of chats...i will surely get my dinner when i need my breakfast",1
App is good but pathetic support. Home delivery is worse. 80 percent of the time i get a wrong order or have issues with my order and i get no support or help from Zomato or the reataurant. 1 star for the pathetic support. I was a gold customer earlier and did not renew my membership just because of this.,1
"The application is becoming unresponsive at peak times like in the afternoon please impove the server handling capacity so that the valet can easily get my location and get my food ASAP ... im still having issue about delivering food to my location exactly, they always used to call me for the location. improve the quality of the zomato valets.",2
"Despite this being the app I open most often every day, I am constantly astounded by how bad and confusing the interface is. To get from point A to point B or accomplish simple things like SEARCHING FOR RESTAURANTS on a RESTAURANT FINDER app to be so damn difficult!! Their customer support is also quite laughable.",1
"It has been a month the delivery tab is displaying ""something went wrong"" app is now useless. *Edit* zomato ordering app doesnt work if you are behind a firewall. It would be nice to give a message instead of just displaying a generic error message",2
"Zomato menu prices are MUCH higher than the actual restaurant's menu prices for almost all of the restaurants. On top of it, they also get charge delivery fees, surge fees & other ridiculous charges for their service. Even after being a Zomato GOLD member & loyal customer for years now, their chat support is so rude to even take a note of my honest feedback and act upon it to improve. Rather, they blame the customer & shamelessly challenge to go for other options available in the market",1
This is the worst app i have ever used. I placed an order at night the stupid delivery boy was roaming here and there for an hour. I even shared my location twice. He went three times in front of my eyes i was constantly talking to him on phone and at last he gave the excuse that my number wasn't reachable. My order got canceled and my amount wasnt refunded at all. Worst app Fake app Fakeness overloaded I even filed a complaint in National consumer forum regarding the same.,1
One the worst and pathetic experience I ever had on food aggregator platform. No sense of professionalism or empathy towards customer. They are ready to fight with the customer day in day out but not ready to resolve the issue. I myself was able to call up the restaurant and resolve in a minute... But the Zomato representative was arguing between spicy n non edible when the restaurant already agreed it is nit edible. The escalation team called to say we can't do anything or raised a complaint.,1
"Some items were expidred of my order from Jai Bhavani Vadapav. I raised this issue with Zomato. Zomato has added rs. 47(Expired items amount) as promo code so that I can use that in my next order as promo code. Now my confusion is the code ""ZOMATO"" giving more benefit than provided refund code of 47 rs. I dont think I can ever use my refunded money. Suggestion: Refunded money should always be credited to wallet not as promo code.",2
Worst customer service placed order at 8:00 PM delivery time was 8:49 PM it's 9:19 PM the order is still in the kitchen as per tracking. no number provided by Zomato team of the restaurant is correct. Cannot contact them and Zomato is requesting me to wait more without anything not cancelling my order not refunding stating we cannot refund unless the order is not delivered to me. So I guess I've to wait for a lifetime then they'll realise it's not gonna deliver. WORST SERVICE EVER!!,1
Clean. Safe. Professional. Timely. Amazing.,5
Worst customer support ever. There is only chat option and staffs not always available. You will get message saying write a mail to us for your issues. Why the hell we will waste our time to write issues which will in turn take 1 week to get resolved. Why can't zomato introduce help desk call system. I hate this app. My issues are still pending with zomato which I sent by mail. I prefer Swiggy customer support. You guys suck. Who don't value customers are worst service providers. Uninstalled.,1
"The Gold tab isn't behaving as it used to before the new update. When i enter a location (in Gold tab), instead of presenting all the Gold partner restaurants, it just yields all the resto in that place, which is just the same if you do in the Go Out tab. Really inconvenient. I like the previous version better.",1
Disgusting service... I ordered food... The food was not upto the mark... I just contacted the customer care on chat to get the food back. They refused..... Their reply was sorry for the inconvenience... Nothing else after that....😞😞,1
"Im happy customer with zomato..but few delivery people are not seeing instructions send by customer.kindly see to it.and assign people to carry change in cash. Its a very useful app and good offers. Kindly come up with more upgrades in membership with better options on that,like Platinum or so,with more exciting offers.",4
"very bad, in app it was showing you will get 30% more cashback if your predicted team wins under zomato premier league. i have select the restaurant under this scheme and after placing order, there is no option for select team. i have placed order for particular restaurant only to use this scheme but feel zomato posting fake scheme to get order. very bad... even customer support asking for error snapshot... they didn't even aware about there new scheme of zomato premier league...be aware guys",1
"The customer service chat is very difficult to navigate and it is almost impossible to chat about an issue that is not listed in the automated list, with an actual representative. Another very strange thing is that you can't chat about your current order only previous orders.",1
"It's really frustrating when chatting to a chatbot when we try to report my payment methods are miss used from Zomato app. I tried even 'report emergency' option also, but nobody from Zomato responded to it. There is absolutely no contact number given to contact their customer care officer also Coming back to the issue, I received multiple messages from banks by saying that Zomato is requesting for random amounts from my account 😡 Guys please don't go for this app!",1
"Ordered breakfast. Waited nearly an hour, saw the delivery chap reach the restaurant (estimated time for delivery was already nearing), and the order got cancelled. A stupid nonsensical explanation from the customer care. I'm still hungry. Will never use again and hope others don't either. The worst thing that could have happened is for Uber eats to have been bought by zomato. I sorely miss their service.",1
"This is the most pathetic app I have ever used. I lost my money when I ordered from Zomato. I have saved my address and have used it several times before but after updating this app, It again asked me my address. I wrote my correct current address but Zomato's Map wrongly detected my current address and did not deliver the parcel on my location. It is ZOMATO's FAULT. But still they are not refunding me even after informing them about their mistake. So, if you are wise never ever use this con app.",1
"The App experience is good. However, there is still a need of briefing to be provided to the valets and restaurants on how to response to customers, czz I've had some pretty bad experiences in my area.",3
"I have been using this app quite frequently. Yes they have improved in customer services. Still need a complaint platform, where the issues can be resolved quickly. Otherwise great offers, great service. Happy Consumer.",3
"This an fake app Or service. If we are facing any problem with our order! The zomato customer care persons are not giving proper response to the custmers. If we are trying tell our problem with the customer service person, they easily sending one email id and going to offline. If we sending mail to telling our problem! They are giving response after 24hrs.what should we do with that food till their response. Guy please dont use this zomato, swiggy is giving batter service with compare to zomato",1
Very limited options available as compared to swiggy,2
I would like to share my experience which might not be same with every individual. We have started new cafeteria but the support from the Account Manager is worst ever. Very much lack of information. No support on the time. No help is provided when actually needed.,1
As disgusting as it can be.This app is at their best to ruin your mood n food..No Good UI even you won't be able to find many things.Being a new user I have NEW50 code valid for first 5 orders whereas I couldn't be able to use it for my first order even n then their chat executive argue on this n don't understand the problem at all. According to Executive I am not a new user at all n on the other hand I have used NEW50 code already.Now who's right?Definitely Deleting this app n deleting my account as well.Thanks for your services.Swiggy is far better than you.Learn something.Now they will reply here to mail them the problem.,1
"Price are too high For example, one product price is Rs50 in hotel, zomato is showing Rs70, 80 and after adding to cart 40 to 44 rupees added to delivery charges total amount is 110 to 120 rupees. 50 rupees product zomato charging 110 to 120 rupees. So after I uninstalled this app We are all not stupid to buy 50rs product for 120rs. Understand Zomato",1
"Bought Pro membership but now the discount is not getting applied and even the Pro support is of no help, poor support service. Did not expect this service after buying the membership, it seems it is of no use... Money wasted... I got transferred 6 times on chat and more than 45 minutes on chat but didn't get any resolution. Zomato is just playing with customers.",1
Very bad experience through zomato food order... Always they cancel my order and process refund to my account... Not accepting orders every time... Occasionally for 5 minutes to 10 minutes only they are accepting the order in my city BERHAMPUR. Not happy with such service... I m gona uninstall zomato and will switch to some other application for food delivery...,1
"I ordered a cake the cake shop calls and says he does not have a pineapple cake so I aksed him to cancel the same and ordered another one and apparently both got delivered wasting my money, moreveover a customer care executive was online with me for more than 40 minutes but neither cancelled the order nor refunded the amount. Be careful of the cake factory and Zomato. They are fooling people",1
Please add a feature of pictures of dishes by restaurants. Its makes much easier to select and its a good attracting strategy. Every dish should have a picture so that customer can easily select. Some restaurants do upload but not all and not for every dish. Its a request.,5
"Well , at the beginning period of using this service was quite helpful but i had more than 3-4 experience of poor service quality as well as sheer negligence from zomato customer care , i tried to call but if u check google u will know the fact that they have provided faulty number , and when an issue occur they say there is a change in their policy . I have lost Rs 500 and other circumstances before. If i had an alternative option available in my area i would have went for that .",3
"this app is a type of organised Frodulence on its customers.I'm having vey poor experience with this app.I've been complaining about issues on the chat option and email id both,but none were of any Help.They only provide false hope and empty promises.They show prices which are more than 50% of the original price on the restaurant menu card, and then offer discount vouchers.That's cheating.They are charging upto Rs80-90 as delivery tax charges.That's ridiculous.I've the Screenshot.Boycott Zomato",1
"great app..convenient. you can get info about all restaurants, as well as can order from them. Apparently, the delivery charge is also pretty low. And the frequent discounts are are plus. Thumbs up.",5
Experience is worst multiple times as some of the ordered food get vanished from the parcel or packet. And sometimes the food didn't reached at all. I was complaining but there was no respond or refund of the paid money. The worst food delivery app of India is ZOMATO. Please increase your standards as you are too poor in customer satisfaction department . What else can I say as there are many complaints.,1
"Worst app. My money got deducted and app is saying payment incomplete. No one from support is responding, no helpline number or such option is given. I haven't got my money back. This app is thief. Don't have option for zero star else I would have been rated as zero start",1
"Frequent offers for most of the restaurants, good application for people staying alone. One thing they have to prove on is the speed of delivery, so that users are not kept waiting for long.",5
"Such worst experience with zomato, made me wait for 1 hour for 15 min initial delivery time . And then cancelled it after 1 hour. The delivery guy told order is not with him and is with someone else. And contact number of delivery guy also didn't get updated. Had to order from somewhere else. Would have given negative rating if it was available.",1
Its very good app but on 10th of july I have order food from Nanded payment done but order not confirmed due to network issue. From my account Rs 154/- debited but the order not completed. I think if payment done & order not completed the amount you received will sent back to my account but till date I have not received the deducted amount. Hence request you kindy refund my amount at the earliest to give proper rating to this app.,3
Very bad experience with the Zomato app. They charged the cancellation fee and their customer executive told me refund will be processed. After flowing them for more than a week they denied the refund. Seriously they don't deserve even 1 star. If there is option to give them zero star.,1
So poor! You forgot the most important thing to cancel the order for free when the food preparation hasn't begun. My little sister by mistakenly ordered some food and I wasn't able to cancel the order even your valet didn't reached the restaurant and it shows that you have to pay the amount bcoz the food preparation has begun but the delivery man doesn't even ordered the food... Fix this..,1
"A company with values a rarity in this world. one of the finest services you can ever use. Excellent delivery, always on time. Delivery boys are extremely polite and courteous. If there is an issue their customer care has been prompt and useful.",5
1. Extremely worst customer service. Waiting for more than 25 mins to chat with the customer support but didn't receive a single response 2. No option to cancel the order 3. Waiting for my order for more than 1.5 hr whereas order delivery time was 25 mins. No valet assigned to the order yet and app says order is on time 4. The restaurant numbers showing in the order are not responding. Not sure if restaurant is open or not. Nobody is picking the phones 5. My cousin had a similar experience today but luckily after lot of struggle customer support responded and cancelled the order. Not sure when money would be refunded,1
The worst app ever. Always have some issues. & when you try to connect with help team there r no calling option. You have to select from giving optn. & those option r not related with problems. Totally waste off money. Going to delete this pathetic app . Which always give worst experience,1
horrible service from zomato. I havn't received order which was ordered on 3rd july and still there is no news of refund.delivery time mentioned was 35 mins & after 11/2 hour also i didnt get it I had a chat with ur customer service which they had returned only half of my money to my wallet. Later they said they will return whole money to my account in 2 days. But it has not happened. Can I know when can I get my money back?I need my money to paytm account as I'll never use your service again,1
"the best part of zomato is, that I got to explore the hotels near me.Otherwise I used to just order from the far ones, coz I never got to know that there are so good restaurants near my home because the other food delivery apps didn't showed them. I even like to add today that Zomato workers are so responsible. I mean a guy came to deliver the food in such a heavy rain. Thank you Zomato",5
GPS is inaccurate,3
"Wanted to write this since a long time.. Had given in negative if permitted. Especially when the app does not move an inch when needed the most..!! Change your app creation team immediately, they have done a blunder.!! The earlier version was much easy to use..",1
worst app ever...there services are not good...from last 4 weeks i have expericed a lot of issues with them... firstly they confirm your order then after one hour they cancel it by giving some stupid excuses..they don't have any backups with them highly unprofessional... customer services are zero.... highly dissappointed..👎👎👎👎👎,1
Zomato backend system promo code is not updated with what's shown in app. Lost money that way and customer care was not accomodative or even did not even try. Same with gold where promo code does not work for normal packs. Overall very deceiving at every stage of transaction. Multiple experiences,1
"Many payment related issues happens. Earlier zomato used to have customer chat support but now this is automated. We can't describe our issue. Sometimes, the delivery fee will also be high. Coupons will applicable but cashbacks won't be credited back. Not so customer friendly",1
My order runs late and zomato staff doesn't have any clue why. I ordered more than one hour ago and i'm asked to wait another 15-20 min. The app says my order is on the way for 45 min now. When the driver arrived she showed me he left the restaurant 8 min ago. I have no idea how Zomato works if they fail to provide accurate updates of my my orders. Not recommending this application at all.,1
Paid 200 with delivery charges and got 100 ml water kind of quantity and same order was done 2 days back got different quantity glass and again order for same changed the quantity and blaming one on other ( lassi corner restaurant & zomato ) we believe if something goes wrong with restaurant zomato will help us but even they will not help you. I have submitted all the Proofs pls stop using zomato just because of offer coupons and discounts.... Swiggy is far better than this people and this is my,1
Very very bad app do not install it ever they just know to rob their customers and nothing else... My order was cancelled by the zomata athority themself and then I was not even provided with a refund.. and secondly the costomer care services are the worst as when I tried to contact them they did not pick ul any of them and then when I tried to communicate in the chat sessions the assistant was soo rude and was misbehaving...,1
"Team, Kindly take back, that Guy to The Job Immediately. Good guy Good And Behavior always. Otherwise we will uninstall Zomato.... Sorry.",1
Don't pay advance payment always pay cash on delivery. Last night I have order from fauji dhaba in chattarpur on advance payment and my address is mentioned on my order. But their rider say your address was not reachable. I have tried calling their rider many times but he didn't pick up the phone and rejected my order and they even refused to refund the amount I pay. I also mailed ZOMATO care with the screenshot of my call details but they said that in our policy no refund will be given.,1
Pathetic service.I mistakenly placed an order and then I asked them to cancel it.they quickly accepted my request to cancel without even warning that they will eat up my money and not refund a single penny. No cancellation fees but the whole amount and while chatting with them they closed the chat in between... So the new money eaters are there in the market. I request all the viewers to be very careful with them. Else you will loose your money in seconds just for a wrong click on your mobile.,1
Super delivery by deliver boy,5
Do not accept orders even if we placed it. It confirms the order exactly half an hour after after it and then it takes another half hour to male a small order. The staff did not responds to messages even the driver did not picks up the call. A order takes no less than half an hour. Worst food delivering app.,1
Useless app. Rider saying it's app issue not allowing to pickup food at restaurants as the app is not working. Restaurant is not giving the food to rider as he is not able to see the status in app. I have paid the amount and waiting for food more than an hour. No one is attending the support chat. Complete waste.,1
I would give zero *. The food did not arrive after 2 hrs. The restaurant did not pick up the phone. The chat service is horrible. They told me to arrange for the same food after 40mins wait. Then all of a sudden the guy vanished only to handover to a new guy who asked the same questions again and cancelled the order . Horrible process. I will NEVER install the app again.,1
food options and menu are good.. but payment options are bad. I get errors all the time. so what is the point of this app if I can not order food.. I don't know what kind of app developers they hire nowdays .. stupid..just stupid .. can't do a thing,2
"i faced lots of issues with your service and support. most of the time something or the other thing happens with my order, and insted of refunding my money in original mode of payment zomato always refunds in their own wallet with expiry. this way i lost 150 yesterday i dont know how many i lost previously, and that too being a gold member. i still have some cash in my zomato wallet which needs to be used. writing this review while facing problem with latest order i placed.",1
"pathetic service. i had placed an order and then i was told that d transaction was incomplete. i notified their chat executive and they told me that the payment was reversed and that the amount will be transfered back to my account. half an hour later, the order is placed without my knowledge and the chat executive didnt even answer my query",1
"In previous version there was a read review count available as well as photo view count was also there, in the new version I couldn't see any of the count in the application. How to track number of read count on the review user had added for the restaurant and same for the photos.",3
No words to tell its very nice,5
"worst services I have ever used. last Saturday I ordered food from your app and paid the bill amount with booking, but I didn't receive food and mobile no of ur valet was switched off,I ordered at 8.15 PM and didn't receive food till 9.50 after that your executive said pls wait for fer more minutes and after that they cancelled my order. could you pls tell me this is your services? I am going to uninstall your app Thank you ZOMATO",1
"easy, early, reasonable and most of the time good food. it gives me freedom to explore much more than i can in a restaurant visit. Promos Provoke me to eat more and stay happy while eating....as I dont have to cook daily. And now with zomato gold its all the more fun having good food. 😊",5
My coupon got stuck in a payment😠💢😠😠,3
"Very bad support team, does not even read what the customer is writing",1
"I filed a complaint on 15/03/2020 by mailing at the official email it provided by the company about a wrong delivery, they replied that the problem will be solved within 48 hrs. But I didn't get any notification yet. It's sad how they cheats with the costumers by misguiding them... I'm deleting the App.",1
"Fraud app. For prepaid order, I kept waiting at the entrance and the rider never came. The company got it's money, the shop got it's purchase price and the rider got his tips as well as the parcel( anniversary cake) ; the total amount was debited from my card since there is no cash on delivery. Moreover the company in its app did not provide the rider's number. ₹ 354/- was cheated but more than that the celebration was spoiled. Don't use this service. Opt an alternative.",1
Very bad!!! Delivery partners facing issue for very less amount on orders...😔 I request to increase the minimum orders coz they have separate the money for petrol and all they are putting efforts too as per that they should paid good amount of money,1
"worst app store, Even the hotels not accept the orders for longer period, they need to assign a valet to go restaurant and request the hotel to accept the order, but the valet would be 15km away when assigned, got irritated by ordering few times, they are far away to reach swiggy type of services.",2
a pathetic app ever i see while i am set my address that time amount automatically deducted and while i cancelled my order full Amount charge as penalty and i request then to give atlist my order they refused and while i am sending mail they also don't reply me... this the last time i am placing an order and never recommend to use this app... instead of use this app I'll give money to any poor people.. a pathetic and most disgusting app I'll see.. late replay no replay on chat.,1

"Very bad experience Location not accurate Jagannath temple Puri shown in Bhubaneswar I lost Rs 589/- due to location error, I live in Puri and ordered but after ordered I came to know that Jagannath temple Puri is situated at Bhubaneswar as per Zomato. Hence my order couldn't be delivered and cancelkef, further as per Zomato policy refund can not be processed against that order.",1
Too costly as compared to swiggy. Absolutely no benefit in Zomato Gold . It's Complete waste for me. Deliver charges and on top of it resturant charges . Both of these charges are very high. You don't get any of the benefit in Zomato gold. The restaurants which are listed in Gold are ones which are dying or is extremely costly.,1
"Zomato Gold membership is totally waste. Firstly, there are not many Zomato Gold partners. Secondly, when ordering delivery on Zomato Gold partner restaurants, if the restaurant is already offering 30% off, then after selecting Gold Unlock, that 30% off vanishes. Full MRP of two items minus ₹300 is to be paid, along with additional charges. So, actually there is benefit of only around ₹100, instead of ₹300. Nice trick applied by Zomato to fool its Gold customers.",1
"the app seems efficient with amazing offers. however, i see many restuarants putting boards stating that they deliver via Zomato and these restaurants are located in extremely unhygienic area like open gutters nearby, etc (some are even located on the edges of slums). it makes me quite apprehensive of the quality of the food despite the ratings given (because such ratings can easily be paid for).",3
No excuse for wrong order delivery,1
"I have quite a good experience in it. Though my expenditure has increased to a higher level. But nothing beats good food! The app is very user friendly. Easy to order, easy to pay. Even the customer service is good.",5
Super cheap and bad app,1
Very ridiculous app. Am really fed up with your app. I have placed an order in shake and shakes at 6.10 due to your network my order accepted in restaurant at 7.10. am totally fed up. I wont suggest your app to anyone. After i get this order will uninstall your application.,1
Very very bad experience my one order is cancelled by retaurent or by zomato but my refund is not given to me from 9dec 2020 till date today 5 jan i have write many times but no action is being take by zomato . So i will not recommend this app to my one's.,1
"Virtually non existent customer service. If u made a mistake, there is no way you can amend even before the restaurant confirms order. No helpline number in app. Chat support take 20 mins to even come online and of course no apologies forget any solution from them Stay sway as better option available with competitors",1
"I had a problem with swiggy, i had ordered 3 items in hotel indraprastha. the items i got delivered is only one i lodged a complaint but i got reimbursement for only one item. now after installing Zomato it's fine going on very well and I'm happy till now,i have given 4 star coz I think it's a long way to go with Zomato. well done guys ☺️",4
"Worst app ever, doesn't even update the restaurants that are closed, and they still take and accept the orders and charge money and when you go to pick up the order, you see that there's no such restaurant in that area! Fraud companies! Worst customer care! Doesn't care about it's customers at all!",1
sometimes the orders ary delayed too much ... and what's worsee is that there's no one to answer to your calls and atleast inform how much time would it take any if at all it'll come or not ... many a times it happens that after waiting for hours and hours they cancel your order ... it's pathetic at that time,3
Now it has became better app than which I used year back.,5
Good ambience Great service !!!!! Tasty food !!!! The staff is friendly and welcoming ..... Incident: I ordered a pizza there which was served burnt on the sides so I asked the waiter to change without any hesitation they gave me a replacement .... In any Restaurant I didn't got a result like this so coz of this incidence and such good hospitality and service.... I gave them a 5 star and also because of their cheeze Sandwich it was yum!!!! Do,5
It's good and can be improved the app efficiency  by adding the offer option in the menu also on the website. And also update the tracking option on your website. Hope to see these changes in future updates.,4
I am new user on zomato it shows 50 percent off on first order but when I place order zomato does not take promo code What the hell is this,1
"Positive - lots of offers, discounts and more choices Negative - Poor customer support. My refunds were still pending since last month. You can't even call them to follow up. Sending messages for the initiation of refunds, however, no processing has ever been done. 👎👎👎",1
Enjoying it but if they are going to make limits to use Zomato Gold then it will be no fun... wont think to subscribe for gold again. I hope it remains the same as it was. Rest if anything you are ordering nd if you haven't receive your full order then zomato do compensate it for. Everything is going good so far with zomato only Wondering if what changes they may do with Zomato Gold.,5
Whenever I minimize the app then open it again it always directs me to the homepage so now I gotta search for the restaurant again. Kind of annoying. Also whenever I keep opening the app it always wants me to enter my current location address even though it has access to my location already. This app was great before the Gold Zomato era started.,3
Loved This App A Heart For Zomato ❤️ The Reason Why I Love This App Is That This App Doesn't Take Any Delivery Charge And Also If We Don't Get The Food At The Given Time By The Delivery Boy The Food Is Free For Us But I Will Not Take The Food In Free I Will Give Him Money Because His Efforts Is Important,5
"Order was cancelled while it enroute, and they don't have customer care on call, I wonder if really do care for customer, they just know how to eat food in between 🤔🤔 have rated 3 stars after using for more time and i thought they improved this worth.. will update as accordingly.",3
The app is good but the service is not. I ordered pav bhaji with extra pav and they didn't gave it. I took the snapshot and reached to the customer care chat. They did not reply on time. It felt like no one is there. Then i received the reply. Then it was taking much time for the messages to get blue tick and read. During this process i ate the pav after which the chat guy asked for order id and then again waiting and waiting. Almost 11 min passed after which the guy asked for screenshot.,1
I wish I had option to give zero..u cancelled my order just because my phone was not reachable for 5 mins though I already paid for it online..no process initiated for refund till now..and the chat support says a single word I.e mail to so and so..then why is chat support for..what a customer service..hope I never get a day when I ought to order from zomato,1
Horrible.. They made me pay rs. 10 and mentioned if the food is not delivered within the given time the food will be free.. The food was delayed by 30 mins.. And then they send a message that the specified address was not exact.. Very bad experience.. I will be putting this on instagram and twitter..,1
Very bad service. They always has this technical issue that the delivery guy cannot deliver the food. If your delivery guy cannot deliver the food listed in your app then why the hell do u even run this business. I had to sit 2 hrs waiting for the food and my order got cancelled thrice. PATHETIC SERVICE GUYS. PLEASE USE ANYOTHER FOOD DELIVERY APP EXCEPT ZOMATO.,1
"The customer service is not up to the mark, though the offers are quiet lucrative. I'm a foodie and frequently order from Zomato and Swiggy. Recollecting a couple of incidents from zomato, Valet seems to have a habit of delivering food with missing items and Zomato expects you to write an email to them elloborating the situation- like seriously? Why can't you simply arrange a separate valet to deliver the missing items- just like how swiggy manages to do it?",1
"Horrible service here in Pune, the delivery person never verify if the order was correct while pick up. I received half the order and the second time the order was placed the delivery person's bike was broken and He never shows up. I reach out to Zomato and they can do nothing. Swiggy is a 100 times better than these folks, they immediately move order to other delivery person. I only open this app because KFC is not there in swiggy. Hopeless customer support, avoid if you can.",1
The valets are unavailable and half of the restuarants are unservicable most of the time.Price of the items are high too. Customer service is poor. You can only contact through chat system.Delivery charge is more about looting from the customers for Zomato. Altogether it's a disappointing experience.,1
"very worst service providers compared to others. i have ordered food without applying coupon, so i cancelled as soon as i ordered it. But this customer care are very careless and not taking any actions on it, they simply give us one email id and ask us to write a mail to it and also this wont be resolved quickly.",1
So if you are hungry and trusting on Zomato!! then wish you All the Best to survive the long fasting battle you are about to go through!!Initially the app was good but at present it is horrible!It takes around 45 minutes to get your order accepted as most of the restuarnts will close online requests in between of placing the order.And even after placing the order it takes more than an hour these days to get the food!,1
"Even after enabling my location for delivery, the ""repeat order"" took the ""last delivered to"" address on itself. What the hell!!! And now when i want to chat the keyboard isnt responding. Poorly developed app. Very bad experience",1
Zomato customer support team is not fast responsive it take too much time for solve our query.The worst ever is the zomato. They are just the worst ever. When I asked them to take it back they say its not possible.. Which means I'm. Supposed to eat the expired food... Very poor executive or co ordinator When you ll do complain they ll give you some greedy offer.. unprofessional and worst service ever. Full of liars and cheaters...,1
the service wich i faced was very worst.not only 1 time evretime when i place an order ther will delay due to that food will become cool and tasteless...and there is no proper response or concer on customer. If we cancel the order they wont give refund for that..then why the hell we need to order from this...friends please dont use this app,1
"I would rate ""0"" if possible. I make an order on 10:20 and same order cancled after 30 minutes... Zomato not considering the valuable time of customers... i will not suggest this app to any one.... This app is not work properly... my order rejected after 20 minutes.. this happed to me in third time.. worst managemnt....",1
Bad service. I odered food at 8:30.  The app was showing oder confirmed at 10 . I recieved message that your order is being canceled at 10:05.  What is this ? Is this the way to serve your customers  I was hungry from the morning. When i called your customer care they replied politely that i can order from other restaurant. I can order but from where i will get time to eat. I have to go office. I too have work to do . I m not free always to wait for your oder .i m going to unistall app.,1
"Zomato has improved a lot. But the restaurant ratings are fake on the platform.. which can be altered with money. If something can be done to increase the security, then I think the experience will be true and much better!",4
"unable to procced to payment gateway...it says something went wrong,try again later. it took several attempts to place an order and lot of time waa wasted. previously i even gave up on this and called the restaurant directly to order. this is only a recent experience but the app was very good earlier",2
Bad experience from Zomato. Ordered food and its was shown will be delivered in 20min. After 1 hour also it was showing 15min. Contacted support but no proper response from the Zomato executive also. After some time status changed to delivered but I have not good anything delivered. Shocking is that even Zomato executive is also not responding properly.,1
Edit My review because the Customer service is worst experience given. This app is zero star. I ordered Combo Pizza which includes 4 pizza and 1 Garlic bread at the Delivery time the delivery boy is taken 3Pizza and 1 Garlic bread and he doesn't know my order or he is not have my Invoice. Your customer care is add The Promo code for my account and now he says we can't add. Such a hat's off to your customer service. A pathetic service.keep it up Like this,1
not good . order placed accepted assigned messenger started to deliver after 15 minutes say no body to serve time over to serve. v did not cook at home our 6 guest gone hungry. charging services goods cost without serve. what it should be penalty for befor zomato accepted order then cancelled and charges cancellation money? I feel always pay cash on delivery then on time v can be served in time. FIRST RESOLVE ISSUE THEN DEFINITELY I WILL CHANGE MY REVIEW. TILL TIME I WILL HOLD NEXT ORDER.,1
"this is the second time m facing the same problem of location.. this app is hopeless in marking delivery location and even after providing address delivery person could not b able to find the address and trouble customers..not at all good app.. m not happy.. this is like ""spoiling ur mood before food..""",1
"placed order in zomato, then received call from the restaurant, stating that my order cannot be taken, as the delivery address is off the limit from zomato's policy, then why did the app allow me to take the order in the first place. Now I'm highly doubtful whether I'll receive my refund or not.",1
Worst experience...contact numbers of restaurants are wrong and even delivery guy has switched off his number...order is placed 2 hours back still status shows ur food is being prepared...bogus app it happened again money deducted but no order received...moreover there is no dedicated customer care....all money in vain...I'll request everyone please uninstall this bogus application and stop ordering food from them...they only loot you...am giving 1 star because there is no option to give 0 star,1
Worst service ever!! I'd rather use swiggy Very unresponsive and issues don't get resolved quite often,1
Promotions/Discounts are not applicable always in all orders. Also I don't appreciate the fact that the app asks to add tip to the delivery guy (though it's optional) knowing the fact that zomato is already charging for delivery. Rest the service is good.,3
"Very very poor experience. Please recruit some sensible people for delivery so that they actually read the address and know where they have to deliver the food exactly to, polite people at customer care end so that they know the correct way of speaking to your customers. They don't even have the urge to help out the customers and are made to sit at customer care end. Useless service. Already sent numerous mails if this is wot u suggest. U ppl are cheaters using cheap techniques of earning money.",1
"Delayed delivery of food . While order was placed eta was 25 mina but the food was deliveredafter 1. 30hr.i was running late as I had to catch a flight in 1 hr. Initiated cancelling, but the customer care was not supportive rather they said cancellation charges will be applied. For delayed delivery by the delivery boy customers have to suffer. No tracking or coordination with the guy. N the food arrived when I had already left my place So money wasted food wasted. Poor service. Rude valet.",1
They have the most pathetic customer support . Half the time they don't understand their own app glitches . Each issue is dragged for a month so that the customer himself can close the thread . Kindly sort out your email login issue or atleast disable multiple logins if it's same email or don't release too many sub products and then merge into a super app which cant handle the login and the subscription products are lost and customer has to suffer becoz you don't know where it has gone .,1
I have done three order by zomato for the same Day. all of three orders quality of food is very bad. I used first time and my experience was very bad. I am not satisfied with this app and I never use for this app presently and future. my first experience was very bad. no stars and no rating. I will never use zomato and it's services. i order an ice cream and when I received my parcel it was leakage .when I asked for zomato service centre they were take a proof .no action require for zomato side.,1
Few orders went well. but Zomato really don't think sometime sensibly. after ordering the food which got accepted and food was getting prepared for 45 mins then the order got cancelled because the zomato person cant wait longer. now I have to order from another restaurant. I had to go to SWIGGY which is much better. I was a regular customer of Zomato but this kind of things really puts you into bad position.,1
"Hopeless service. Ordered food thrice. Never came on time. Once missed a dish. Worst thing happened today. Delivery as usual came late. Bu after delivering food, Zomato Valet asked to get my phone. Zomato app and my order was already open since I was seeing where it is. He on his own rated both service and food 5 star and asked me to keep it as it is. Unbelievable! When I went to Zomato chat, within a few minutes, I realized that I was chatting with a bot who didn't understand my problem!!",1
I have had an issue with regards to an order. Tried contacting the customer service but to no avail. There doesn't seem to be a call option either for grievances. It would be helpful if there were means to talk to customer support on call in times of urgent situations.,3
"If you placed an order & made the payment, you are tracking your order that it is getting prepared, it is on its way , 5 min away from you, anyhow you are controlling your hunger.Plz don't be sure enough that after 1 hour of impassionate waiting you will get your order as any moment Zomato will reply ohh something went wrong, your order is rejected kindly place a fresh order. Believe it this harassing exper had happened with me my order is rejected when delivery boy was only 5 min away from me.",1
needs to connect more restaurants in city. also try to connect some reputed hokkers of the city. tip option also should be added in cash payment. expand your delivery area. so that you can connect more people. try make app more easy handling and also try to have an option on train delivery as many people travel and they have food issue in travelling. select the best restourants on public review,2
"Totally disappointed, waiting for food for the last two hours and havent received yet. If food cannot be delivered due to heavy rush of restaurant. Just tell customer in advance that it will take time, rather than keeping them hungry",1
"Be aware of what you ordered for, mostly they delivery incorrect order and they try to made believe us that restaurant delivery correct order only. Customer support won't understand the issue and finally they tells that they won't repeat this again. we won't get proper resolution from customer support.",1
Worst Customer Service from Zomato. No representative is there to take any kind of request or help. also Delivery person dont know the routes they ride whole of the city and come to your place. Sometimes it can take more than an hour to deliver your food. There is no delivery timelines or rule to deliver on correct time. I could have give -1 stars but there was no option.,1
"unable to place the exact location in the map and that makes problem for the valet as well as the customer . map shows the nearest location not the exact one. so evertime when I order, the valet goes to a different place. so we stopped giving orders",3
i would strongly recommend not to use zomato as food quality is not at all good recent times...in app dey show as restaurants names but food will be delivered from KITCHENS which is very pathetic to have...there is lot of difference between actual restaurant food and food delivered from KITCHENS..We recently ordered with ALBEK but food was delivered from KITCHENS which was not real restaurant taste and quality of food was too bad ended up in food poison..same wen ordered in name of A2B restautant,1
I think it will take only less time to deliver the food but is more than 2 to 3 times with me that it has taken very long time to deliver the food sometimes it is may be 1 hour to being placed the food it has doesn't reached on to the time very bad delivery service as they don't know the perfect location after delivering one place to soo many times my half of the time has been just waste to describe the perfect location to the zomato vallet to reach to the house very bad delivery service,1
Good and safe delivery,5
Delivery is good but Worst Customer service. We don't even get reply for our issues. I have faced this again and again. Zomato chat is worst. Also there is no customer service number to contact for your order issues. I had received wrong order item. I have been trying to reach customer service for hours but no response. Only a chat comes in thank you for using Zomato. Frustrating,1
Everything is great in Zomato. It's just I'm unable to pay through simpl dispite of having simpl pay balance available,2
"Terms and conditions not clear... once there is one area name wrongly added to after my complete address , delivery denied inspite of several deliveries on same addressbefore this delivery and whole advance payment foreited. Also the same address was clearly communicated to delivery boy but still it is not delivered and amt forfeited. Total cheating",1
I am using zomato service from 3 months and it is very responsive and fast to deliver your order. I am very satisfied with zomato delivery service. But one thing is there that i am not able to understand that why do the delivery man always forces us for rating at delivery receiving time. It is customer's right that he will rate on the delivery n food after eating n cheaking the quality of food. Otherwise everything is good 👍👍,5
"it happened with me twice or thrice,food quality was very bad ,i complained to zomato,the answer given by zomato this is restaurant issue,we dont have control over it,everytime they said they will be taking feedback from the restaurant and again nothing would happen. neither they remove the bad quality sellers from their platform nor compensating their customers for bad quality food ordered by customers.very bad experience atlast i had to remove this app from my handset.",1
"Their service has gone down, orders are getting delivered to the wrong address, or they don't even send the order to the restaurant at all till after 45 min of placing the order. Even then they have a no cancellation policy.",1
"Food tracking is not working, it showed me he was at restaurant and after few seconds they cancelled my order and took the money and food, i accept i dont have signals to contact rider or vice versa. i send message to contact support and they replied me 30 min back and they said we can't provide your food or money back. even before when i ordered maggi they havee plain noodles. they are completely money minded, always play cheap tricks",1
The app is very buggy. If I put some order in my cart and go back to home page then every restaurant shows unavailability. I have to clear the cache of the app or wait like 10 minutes to get the app working again. And this happens every few minutes.,2
Terrible service. Should've stuck to Swiggy. Delivery executive not appointed. When appointed he says delivered although food hasn't even been oicked up. No coordination with restaurant. Very disappointing. Been an hour and still waiting for food from a restuarant which is 20 minites away.,1
Zomato is good 👍 faster Dellwary,5
First time when I was ordered something I face some issue but after that I complain they give some discount for that ..after that my experience was very good ..every time ordered food my food come on time ..still hot and always come before the time and this app v easy to used ..and friendly to use and u can every food brand or restaurant of Abu Dhabi in it ... amazing experience with zoomato ... One thing something app takes too watch on searching or giving display .. otherwise all good......,5
"Worst Service and Not at all User Friendly. Inspite of saying that food is unhygienic our the place I had order. So I had immediately cancelled the order. Refund was not initiated, request was not listened. No value for customers here & hard earned money. I do agree you have policies. But some policies should be customer friendly and it would be helpful for improvement. Instead, You guys are saying the same thing repeating the same always.. I haven't received needful refund. RIP ZOMATO",1
"The mobile website is useless. It prompts you to install the app if you want to get any useful information. When the whole world is making their stuff work from mobile website, Zomato is cruising in the opposite direction.",1
"I have started using this for a while and I must say, it's an ultimate comfort for customers. One can have their favorite food at their door step without moving a single step outside their home. What else can you expect? It's a complete delight for me.",5
"placed an order, money got deducted, it is showing contacting resturant for confirmation, from last 45 minutes, zomato chat not responding, waited for 18 minutes, what will i do of your food after waiting 45 minutes for confirmation, still no confirmation for order, and after cnfrming after 45 minutes it is showing order is on time😂😂😂 what u ppl are doing???what to do now?? had my dinner, keep ur order and money too. make it correct to serve better.",1
Had a worst experience. Had to cancel my order and they've cut the entire order money as a cancellation charge. I wouldn't have lost my money if i hadn't paid in advance. I suggest no one to pay via netbanking.,1
"I ordered for food , but automatically it cancelled. Zomato customer support was very worst. Not receiving food after waiting a long time and loss of money for food . Online payment done very Fastly still food not delivered. I didn't get any refund too. Swiggy and. Uber is better than Zomato",1
Uninstalling the app till kamaraj gets justice and his job back.,1
Kuddos guys you are doing a wonderful job. The options provided in regards to environmental awareness is thumbs up 👍 and to add cooking instructions and make sure it is done the way another great option. Thank you Zomato for making our lives easier specially when we not in the mood to cook neither do we wish to go out😉..,5
U offer cheap prices with great discounts Thanks Zomato,5
"Hi Team, Zomato is making happy to all people with there foods which they order. But small suggestions is please include food cards and prepaid cards options as payment which is also beneficial to you and as well customers. Because many customers have prepaid cards and food cards through which they can order it.",4
For not giving compensation to that delivery man,1
"I m very disappointed with your delivery timing it's about 1hour late delivery due to which my guest wasn't enjoy their meal. Food was mismatch which unacceptable, few days later I personally delight with your service that's why I insisted that order from Zomato instead of Swiggy but I m very disappointed with your service.",1
Worst experience.. it's been more than 10+ days to refund and I haven't received yet. very poor customer service and there's no use of writing a mail to order@zomato because they don't even respond well. They promised to refund and they are so irresponsible towards the customer. they make false promises and they don't reply even after an hour.,1
"Bakwas app. In the starting it delivered to my house but from a few days the restaurants which we love, when we click on that restaurant it shows that it is currently not delivering at this location. Not at all helpful to order food whenever you like.",1
I do not received my order but order has been delivered after that i complan but do not received any reply from zomato. So now i will go for consumer court.,1
Most useless and unprofessional and irresponsible team from CEO to customer care executive. They least bother about customer and care damm about us.... Dont use this app... Have zero control on their vendors... If you raise issue they consider you a fraud and consider their vendor as god.... All cheats.. dont download,1
"Very pathetic customer service, no Matter appreciate the good job they are doing by providing food delivery at the required place but at the same time the customer service as very annoying. No proper response, very much delay in responding and problem doesn't get resolved at all atlast!!",2
"I ordered sprite along with other items, and got one but it was not refrigerated at all, I contacted zomato customer support, they saying like while ordering due hot weather outside the drink might lost coolness, I ordered past 5pm today and I'm staying in Banglore, their excuses is not valid, and they are stacking excuses upon excuses, Not going to Use this App anymore",1
This app is a cheater... I have ordered food. They charged money for it and suddenly it says that my order has been cancelled... They thick that they can play with others money.. The service they provide through msg...that thing doesn'teven reply me even after 10 minutes and i am still waiting for its reply.. This is how u treat ur customer.,1
"Worst experience i had faced. Chat support replied me after half an hour, sometimes they can't unable to assign executive. Showing my food deliver even after not deliver to me. I will raise complaint against it and take a legal action about that. These are wasting so much valuable time and deliver nothing. No consideration of cutomer's time. Worst service ever.",1
"I dont have any complain but l loved the experience. The food was reasonable price, the food was tasty, the delivery boy was perfectly on time even when it was raining and also very polite. Great!",5
"Horrible app... Order got placed twice becausr your app said UPI payment did not go through....hence we switched to cash....but because online payment went through, it ended up creating two order....your zomato executive on chat said if he cancels the order, we still have to pay for both....have no words for such dumb response and dumb rules on zomato",1
"The Customer care Sucks. They don't even have phone number to Contact. Some times they don't even give the Cash back if the food is missing,I complained the same to them they told me that the Hotel have given all the order. They are looking people money like this New issue, missing food but Zomato didn't return back money.",1
"Pretty bad UI design. Not intuitive. Too many boxes, can't close them, can't look at the map properly. Status does not refresh, forced to close the app and reopen it every time to look at the status.",1
"Worst experience with Zomato, Order place and accepted by restaurant but based on rider's availability my order has been cancelled, and refund will be credited after 24 to 48hours, totally I've waited 40 to hear cancel notification, is this make sense. This is not only first time, I thoroughly facing this type of issues",1
Overall good experience. But directly call restaurants for ordering is alot cheaper if restaurant provides delivery service in your area. Delivery distance should be increased as orders can not be placed with lot of restaurants in deliverable distance due to delivery limit.,4
"Worst delivery service ever u can experience!! don't encourage these app, they serve cheap food!! and there is no proper customer service .better go for other services like uber eats. they will not respond to your queries and they try to escape from it, if there is below 1 star rating it deserves!! Don't order in this and get cheated",1
this app is one of the worst tabs that I have seen till date it picked up a wrong location and when I cancel the order I was not given the refund the customer support said that they will not be able to give the refund which was horrible I cancel the order within seconds and still they say that the restaurant has accepted the order and refund is not possible it is pathetic please don't ever use this app even if you will use it make sure that you are opting for cash on delivery because once you blo,1
"After ordering food getting a call after 45 min maybe that the restaurant cannot deliver to this area. They could have said it when we ordered the food not after waiting for long 45 min and ending everything with a soryy. I am sorry to say disappointing, waiting for food when we are hungry and at last a sorry....",1
"I had a very extence worst experience with zomato, i went to the help section seeking out help with regard to the order, but i was not even given a chance to chat with an agent, instead was slapped with some automatic computerized replies chats being closed automatically, truely and seriously not using this app for the pathetic service by the zomato chat agents, honesty am going for swiggy.",1
"I order a lot since I'm alone at home a lot, and it's really convenient. The discount are nice and service is great. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is cuz it's competitor gives better discounts.",4
"customer care is good and app is easy to use and user friendly. food is ordered on time. There are some restaurants, menu will be available in picture format but no options available to order.",4
"worst application..I don't understand how this application has more than 4 stars overall once after I ordered food from Zomato, applicatio was open in my phone I don't know how it was showing that there is another order from my register no. within a min I called the restaurant owner & asked him to cancel order as it was not from my side the owner suggested me to talk Zomato service person they said it won't be cancel either I have to receive the order or they will be a fine of 100 in next order",1
"excessively charged.. Nevertheless the app shows about 20% to 30% higher prices for the food from the restaurants' menu, they have now introduced distance fee in addition to its existing delivery charge...really disappointed with the move.",1
"With out any proper guide line they add small venders, street food , hotel...for which we got low quality food...this is not a good way to income money.u think customer money is like tree leaf...I never use this app in future and going to uninstall..my 1st and last order with Zomato.. Requesting you all customer don't waste ur money...go to near by quality hotel and purchase..ur mind definitely satisfied.. Zomato have no control I hate Zomato...",1
"Worst experience, no proper support other than the preloaded chat boat which doesnt have the option to register your complaint, address given and location shown in the map doesnt match, ordered item and delivered items didnt match and we do not have a mechanism to complaint. Never pre pay, use cash on delivery to avoid this type fraud",1
"Earlier it was good but now the performance has been declined due to taxes and delivery charges and very less promo codes are available. Literally the worst app the money gets deducted then the order is declined don't know what's wrong even the chat support is worst uninstalling after receiving my refund, highly disappointed.",1
Very poor experience with zomato. Tow times i pay through online tha cash was debited from my account but order was cancelled. Still i didnt get my cash back. There is no customer care no provided by them they only msg and says help will be provided. Comparing to other food delivering apps this have no costumer value and services.,1
"It's a one stop shop for me to order food at any time of day or night ! Depends on your city though however they give you an option almost 24/7. Also, the number of offers they provide is absent on almost every other app. Kudos to the Zomato team. Keep up the good work.",5
I'm personally prefer Zomato to everyone who is looking for best delivery experience and definitely the best deals & offers as well. in my experience i never have ever any delivery issues with Zomato. it's like Zomato team do what they promise for even they do more for better experience of customer. i genuinely feel that Zomato has the very best working staff members who always try to make customer service better and better. All love from Gwalior Thanks Zomato,5
"if i would describe, it was my worst experience. If there were zero star's, i would have happily given minus rating. They don't know how to treat a customer, how to handle queries and moreover selection of Delivery Manpower personnel', should be reviewed by the respective department of the company, and moreover cancellation charges are paid by the consumer for inefficiency of the Delivery personnel.",1
"Pathetic service. The delivery guy didn't even call me and cancelled my order. Food also gone, money also gone. The amount was also big. And customer centre says ki we can't help it Edit1- worst app one can install. Never pay in advance. Delivery guys have installed a new method by which either they don't call you or WhatsApp call you like you can't notice. And they will run away with your order",1
a total waste of money if u place a prepaid order..they don't display the delivery person no. and say upfront the no. of delivery person is there.don't know how educated person are sitting in customer support as they don't know about their own app or system.can't post screenshot here or else would have done that too. i would say...use SWIGGY instead,1
"I ordered food twice using this application. First Time i got late delivery around 40 minutes, second time they cancelled my order because of wrong address. They didn't refund my money. After that i ordered using swiggy and got it smoothly. Worst experience.",1
"Bad experience, delayed delivery",1
"super Fast Delivery, Great Discounts... Im total unhappy bcz i put 1 order select cash on delivery as Payment, somehow i have to cancel the order & re-arrange the same from same restaurants.... So ZOMATO will disbale my Cash on delivery option....... I totally unhappy & dissatisfied for this act. & i Uninstalled this Zomato at all...They are not understanding the circumstances in which have to cancel the same... even they don't see my order history till now in which i made no. Of orders & Cancel",1
I am pretty much satisfied with the app and the service we get through it. It's been great experience using Zomato. Only thing bothers me is the taxes which are applied on every product bcoz it makes no sense using a offer code when the taxes are so high as after applying code it comes to same pricing as it was shown earlier.,5
their is so many fake price of resturant actual price is differ for their list and support team is only says lie about your query. once i rise the issue related to my order but they only respone you by saying our team get back you on this matter in 24-48hrs but that never happen. The only you get promotion mail and massage. so as my advice using this app on your own risk ever your get wrong food or quality issue forget your money they never compensated and say lot of lie to cover their mistake.,1
"Rate of order cancellation is too high. The worst part is they will just send u a message after a wait of 30-40mins mentioning ""Your order has been cancelled because of some issue with rider"". Why cant you assign a new rider in such cases? Or atleast respect the time a customer has spent for waiting.",2
It's a great app to browse restaurants and to order food. What would help though is a sorting option to sort places by delivery time. I've otherwise enjoyed getting food delivered through the app. I also loved the Zomato Gold option while I had it.,4
Good app ☺ Nesesery app only super app,5
"Very disappointed by the App since last week, its not working properly, order is showing to be prepared when its already done and sent for delivery. Today i ordered food ay 1:30 pm and its 3 pm now I still have Not received it, neither the restraunt nor the pickup person are responsive.",1
Worst payment mode. I tried 3 times to make the payment for different amount. It got deducted from my bank and here it shows payment failed. I reached out to the bank and found its issue from zomato. I opted out for refund but still its been 3 months the money didn't get refunded.,1
The sales part is good but when it comes to customer support zomato is the worst app ever i have used.There is no proper channel to address the issues and even after mailing to order@zomato only reference number will be created and no response from team after that.Its been like more than 12 days i had an issue with one of the orders and till now it is not yet resolved When i try to contact from app chat they cant help me When i tries to get support via mail no response from zomato itself,1
i can tell its a great outlook from where we can get food without doing footwork.but i hav doubt that if i put a zomato discount coupon on any order they gave me a 3rd class recipe and when i did not put coupon code they gave me a fresh healthy and authentic type food ...why this racism if you dnt wnt to be in loss then why you offer coupon code plz dnt do marketting in this..provide same recipe in coupon order which you provide in no coupon order..,2
On time delivery with all safety measures,4
"I placed an order on zomato, paid online and got no updates for an hour. Got no reply on customer chat at all other than an artificially generated response that said the cancellation charges would be as much as my food amount. Tried calling the number that Zomato gave for the restaurant and it was invalid. So now I have no way of knowing the status of my order and no way of receiving a refund when I have an important meeting tomorrow morning but I have to stay up because of this mess.",1
well recently ive founded the app too cumbersome. Their is no food descriptions when you're ordering them. No photos etc. So it's kind of a arrow in the darkness. The Dine in section also needs to be revamped. Probably a link in with google maps.,2
the worst experience ever. i ordered food at 1:50 am which was supposed to be delivered max by 2 30. i requested chat at 2:30 which was responded at 2:45. i asked them to cancel my order as it was too late but they didnt and delivered the order on 3:20 am. there is no customer support number. the guy on chat support replies after 10 mins each time. they hv no respect towards people's time and money. they are a bunch of crooks.,1
"Extremely unprofessional & immoral service. Delivers wrong items, customer support is unresponsive, ignores customer complaints & they just send template bot replies, all this after paying a premium for their PRO membership.",1
"Most times deliveries are on time. But there are times when deliveries get delayed pretty bad and when you reach out to Support, all you get are canned responses. And then a X about of Zomato credit. If the team can't commit to the delivery times, why publish it on the app? Pathetic service.",1
"I always order food late night and these guys aren't even clear which restaurant is open or is going to be close soon, after deducting money they usually call me to tell that the restaurant is closed as a matter of fact my money got stuck there and it will be refunded after 7-8 business days.",1
I had used Zomato so many times but from last 2 3 times there are so many problems which i had faced. Last time when I had ordered Pizza from dominos they had almost taken 90 minutes to deliver even what the no they had given for the latest update is even wrong. So please guys do not make any order in dominos through Zomato App they all are making fool of us.,1
Apps works fantastic. Too many choices of restaurants. The only this is that zomato charges more than the restaurant prices with that the delivery and packing charges. There is always some or the other charges that is applied. Now a day's the code do not work at all.,2
U ppl r disgusting.... If there is a little high demand min order is 175... If it seems like it's going to rain then min order is 175. Just exploiting ppl to make more money,3
"Worst app ever..Take almost half an hour to place an order..too slow... Well i think there is some tie up between restaurant and zomato.coz after 9.30p.m. when everybody order there dinner the app slow down till 11 o'clock, because after that only little coupons applied and also the delivery charges get high in the name of night charges",1
"Worst app ever there is no customer care or support team in this app. You have to mail your incident to via mail only, they will reply after 2 days or three day. But offer all awesome but any incident happened there is no response to your money and also your message. I'm moved to swiggy.",1
"Worst support system 😠 Highly Disapointed. I ordered food from a resturant from where we had ordered earlier also but the food was not properly cooked, it was not eatable. when i contacted the zomato support system they kept me waiting and replied after an hour and what they said was "" they have talked to resturant owner they said they deliver food in good quality"" and they ended the chat what kind of support system is this ? when they r not gonna help clients 😠 Do not order from ZOMATO ❌",1
Horrible app for those who want to modify or cançel the order. They charge you for cancelling the order and not just the small portion but the whole amount. These people just know how to make fools out of customers. They don't even have telephonic support.,1
Forgot a part of the order. Deducted part of the amount I paid for in the refund for not delivering the item. It's been almost a month. They still haven't paid me. It's shameful that an app like this resorts to such cheap tactics for improving profits.,1
Best app for ordering your favourite food. Customer service is really appriciable. Zomato values the customers like nobody else. They take the issues very seriously and give the most satisfactory resolution to their customers. They even provide compensation if the ordered food is spilled or not packed properly. Offers provided by them is much better than the competitors.,5
"Pathetic delivery service, Zomato keeps disappointing me. Better to go for Swiggy or Box8. When an food delivery app takes more than an hour to get food delivered, they should definitely look into the network. Also chat service is horrible. Nobody replies for your concerned problem.",1
VERY GOOD AND FAST DELIVERY. HYGIENE AND TIMELY DELIVERY📮📮 ALSO.,5
"recently....your services has started in RAJAHMUNDRY, ANDHRA PRADESH,they are many problems with your servers we are faceing a lot,when the money is reducted from the account,but the order is not placed,and we are not getting a message when the refund is done,and delivery boys are explaing that the app is not working,if ur app is such a trash then why did u launched here?,and there is no perfect customer care number which works!!!and where we have to discuss our problems to whom?",1
"The worst food delivery service to ever exist. The customer support is even more dubious and can never be relied upon. This is a skillfully constructed scam that compels you to trade both time and quality for just a bit better price. I use food delivery services such as swiggy regularly but, everytime I use zomato, I'm amazed at how disgusting they play the game. This review isn't specific to one bad experience, it's the result of witnessing over hundred orders where they shamelessly scammed.",1
"Great application but this is because of great software developers. But the ground level service is very very bad. It took 2 hours to deliver the food and at that time i was done with my dinner but the situation was, i ordered my snacks from zomato😙😙😙",1
"I like zomato and their services but they really suck at Banglore. Not sure if its because of Banglore city only, but Zomato really should work on their operations in the city and may be restructure it asap. Everytime I order something, just before the payment it says the store is currently offline. Really frustrating experience. Please try to figure out some way Zomato else you might be losing many customers.",3
Good aap very helpful 👍,5
"Well I was enjoying ordering few months back, but now this app is not worth it. They don't even provide alcohol anymore.",5
Pure waste of money and worst management. This app is technically too bad that the money I paid from paytm got lost and my order wasn't placed saying incomplete payment. And the zomato assistant replied that they will sort issues and refund me in 2 days. It's been 4 days and no support was given. They are not even responding to my msgs.,1
Please don't be fooled buy restaurant's ratings. They show one restaurant and get the food delivered from some other outlet. I had the worst experience of ordering food online from zomato. These guys won't help you if you receive bad quality food. There support system is equally disgusting and in efficient. Better go for swiggy or something else.,1
The worst app i have ever seen...they will take the order and they offer the payment method . . I paid through card and i confirmed it...when i called them back they are telling now it's not available....when i was searching for constumer care num i just shocked it's doesn't have customer care num also ..they are telling they will refund the money back but i didn't get money ...i requesting not go with zomato,1
Very very worst. I just added into cart but did not place order. It ordered without my knowledge and money got deducted from PayTm . I cancelled the order and contacted Zomato to credit my money back but they refused to credit as I cancelled it from my end. If you don't credit money back then why such an option to cancel it. Hence uninstalled it and will never order on Zomato.,1
Make the order a little faster delivery,2
It is very good food delivery app and the food is also good but it takes 100 rupees cancellation charge and it is also fine but the thing I heated the most is that it is not mentioned in the app anywhere and it is very bad thing and the technical glitch occur and why dont you fix it. Because of this reason only my 110 rupees wasted in my first order.,4
"Except haldiram , every order was disappointing. I am uninstalling the app right now. Its better to cook than to order, however bad i may at cooking",1
"A startup with no customer support 1. Zomoto is group where no team who handle service request or customer complaints 2. if you stuck with order/ incorrect delivery, god bless you. customer has to fight like anything for refund 3. All complaints through application which is very time taking process and representative tent to busy and waiting time is 15 minute (amazon customer service team replies within 1 miniute) 4. escalation to aociy media --> still Zomoto not respondes to right query.",1
"The customer service is utter waste. I tried their phone number which does not work, I mailed them yesterday and except for the auto generated response I didn't recieve any mail. I don't know what's with them but I feel other services at least have better customer service.",1
New update is less easy to use. Previously the restaurant's own offer can be seen as a badge over its profile image. Now you can't. Now you have to open every listing to check the offers.,1
"Have sent wrong items and not refunded. Charged cancellation fees for a order that was received and paid. Delivery guy reached the wrong address and asked extra money to come to the right location or meet him half way, upon refusal, denied delivery and refund was also refused. Had to draft so many mails to get one thing correct. Inconvenient.",1
My experience with zomato is good but I think you should little bit faster as per my perception and also you should take the order propley as one day I have ordered some thing else but I got something else and one more thing your delivery men should be polite and your app is having unnesesary ads which are not required by the way your app is good and very convinent and very useful we don't have to go in restraunt I have rated this app four stars and I think swiggy your competitor deliver fast,4
"I have been a regular customer of Zomato, ordering almost daily. Just out of brand loyalty I have put up with extremely rude delivery boys and useless bot chats. I can't even call and chat in problems. But now it's too much. The delivery boys frequently just press delivered on their app and I have to fight hours to then get my order. I am quitting the app (without receiving order, help or refund). I urge people to use swiggy or other apps. Atleast they understand loyalty and have better systems.",1
"Horrible customer service. You contact the chat support team for the wrong order you received and they take ages to send each reply. Also, they do not believe the pictures (which you send) of the wrong food item delivered but go with the word from the restaurant! Bloody people cannot differentiate between gobi and chicken!",1
"Worst experience..as my ordered amount did not get back..therefore any one using this app don't pay it online...always book through COD...else your money gone... As I have contacted the delivery boy with in the timelimit..but order cancelled...by stating I have not responded the call.. but when I have discussed with him..he said half an hour window will be given. I have said to him with in that time I have called you back, but he said..nothing. contacted support..but same answer.................",1
"Offer are great but still I cant understand their delivery policy, of a restaurant publish its delivery time between 20-30 minutes when a order is received after 50 minutes. they are not in favour of customers! they customer care itself accepts that it happens for all the order. please clarify this.",1
"absolutely shocking service, I didn't get my food after waiting for nearly 2 hours, then had to wait to get someone to message me. I'm still waiting for a refund, I won't be using this again and I'll be telling everyone to be very careful.",1
"The service of the app is really disgusting, and really worst restaurants. No support, the guys take a lot of time to reply more than 20minute for a reply. No professional service ans support, the guys don't know to how to talk, Really pathatic service. Its my last time to use it, goodbye Zomato",1
poor support system. invalid restaurant phone number. customer service is not upto the mark.and the cancellation policy is such a mess. have to uninstall the app if I have to pay my last cancellation fee which the zomato agent assured me on phone.hope they ll fix it.,1
worst experience.. it never delivers the food on time. every time they will be like sorry for the inconvenience but again next time it's the same issue. They don't have redeliver policy also. every last moment they will cancel the order and will refund u as zomato credits. such a disappointing app,1
"The food from restaurants is usually incorrect against the ones ordered. After this if you ever try calling or emailing them, you're in for a big surprise because they never respond with their "" 24-48"" hours! Disappointing!",1
"They will store your card and one day suddenly they will charge your card without knowing you on the name of Gold membership at full price when already there is half price discount going on. On inquiry there customer service will say that you will get refund in 7 days, and no response on emails and neither anyone will attend the call on their numbers. And after passing more than 10 days their chat support will also stop responding because by that time they have claimed the amount from bank. Just imaging forcefully you are given Gold membership that too on full rate when already half price discount is going on. And then after commiting for 7 days for refund, they will stop responding you. Biggest scammers.",1
Its not useful app also it is very complicated app to order. Just waste your time. After booking and after taking money they cancel order. Itbseems tbey are more intrested in taking money and keeping it in their account for ahort time. God bless this management with more honesty.,1
"Ive ordered food in zomato on yesterday. By mistake ive placed wrong location, after ive asked the Customer support to change the location. They refused to change the location so i requested them to cancel the order. But they didn't do that. And when i raised a concern they informed me that delivery boy has delivered the food. And zomato people provided me the driver contact details. But he is not answering the calls. When i asked about my refund, again their asking what's the concern.",1
App is full of bugs. Could not apply FAB5 on 3rd order onwards whereas its applicable for first 5 orders. Support people are so illiterate that they are not even able to understand the issue. A big disappointment. I wish play store had zero rating for such apps.,1
"mechanisms is soo poor. if restaurants owner is not delivering fresh food, then in this case zomato do not take any responsibility and even do not provide us a way. Moreover, if place any order by mistake then you cannot cancel it. if you cancel it then they will keep your payment as penalty. like we are criminals and only zomato is good. zero Rating. Poor.",1
Everything is good in this app...but i have 2 request Improve the payment method by paytm upi and remove that new thing if the food will be delivered late than the food will be free bcoz u guyz are deducting the money from the salary of delivery boys..I am using zomato from a good period of time and will continue so...,4
Extremely high taxes. Taxes are more than the actual item. This is completely unexpected from an app like Zomato. The item is 45/-. But the taxes are 61/-. This is seriously unfair. Hope it changes.,2
This is my first order with zomato.. Delivery is ok and the service of zomato also OK.. but the quality of food is very bad out of 3 vegetables two of them are stale {बासी}... Salad is not fresh and only onion there.... Sorry but I am very disappointed with the thali.. I do vomating also..my first experience is bad... Please resolve my request by anything... So I can trust on zomato in future.. Please refund my money if possible with extra penalty on restaurant,2
"too much ""something went wrong try again"". Whenever try to put an order the above quote appears and can't book a single order after trying more than 10 times. There are no problem with network so network delay is not an option.",1
Disappointment from two consecutive orders. Zomato support doesn't care about what is delivered and how it is delivered. There's a high chance that you'll not get a reply when needed. Finally uninstalled the app. The positive side is the UI.,1
I had ordered food and payment made via card. The Valet arrives at my place and says that the order is cancelled however in my phone it says the order is on the way ETA 11 mins. The Valet left without giving food and said you will receive the refund. But till now the ORDER is on the WAY.,1
The update is atrocious. You must select a very specific location in which to view nearby restaurants. Why cant you just choose by location as before such as by city. It makes life so much easier.,1
"Very easy to use and place order ,it is one of the best online ordering app. always good service but one bad thing no option of cancellation .but its ok some time order is cancelled after preparation if you are directly talk with restaurant.",5
i was really frustrated.. i ordered thru zomato app at 8:58 pm. i chat with their cx rep at 9:30 pm and was informed that my order will arrive max 15mins.. at 10pm i chat again with them and was informed that they cannot reach the restaurant. i am waiting now for 1 hr and 10 mins to have my order and they cannot give me exact information where my order ia,1
only concern is that the delivery executive should try calling before delivery and also there should be an automated message from the app before cancelling the order. I've been through a situation before that the delivery executive just cancelled the prepaid delivery and at the end they said my phone wasn't reachable whereas I didn't receive any call from their end.,5
"Very bad. I had issue with the quality of the food and they dint provide me a refund.. They just told me that to write a review, and they will see that it doesn't happen again. First of all why will I order again from that restaurant. Second, I should have gotten a refund, which Zomato denied. I am deeply dissatisfied with the service from Zomato.",1
"Stay away from this food delivery service. They started well in business but offlate their service is degraded a lot. Be it delivery time, food quality or support quality all are pathetic now. If you really want to experience the same anxiety which I experienced while waiting for the delivery of food for more than two hours then go ahead snd order the food.",1
This is a great app for foodie. We get great deals and I use this very often. Though the only problem we face is there is no team which would handle complaint.I have faced many problems during food delivery. The delivery person was not efficient enough. But I could not raise this issue anywhere. The automatic computerised replies do not work in this condition.,5
"App is quite good as compared to others food apps , definetly it has edge over others but on grounds needs continously more working and efforts to maintain the coustomers momentum and also makes sure that important confirmation on apps from customer ends needs double check by reconfirming it twice so that customer didn't loose it by clicking the wrong option by mistake",4
Customer care service is one side . They don't cooperate with us..i was just scrolling for checking the menu and order was done without asking any delivery process .. i had try to cancel the order but their app is not working that time.. they ask to pay penality for cancellation of order. I think this the way of this app to get money from customers.,1
chat support is not working properly... it has shown me 9 min to reply but it's about 50 min till now i didn't even got a single reply no my messages.. they don't even have customer care through call.. it takes the order from where the restaurant cannot give the delivery..how are expectating customer loyalty with this service I'm not understanding...,1
"I entered the locationally manually but somehow the app selected a location on it's own, a location thats not even there. Had to pay the delivery guy separately for the delivery of the order. And the attitude of the customer care was not good.",1
I would had rated them in negative had there been an option. worst service and worst response. opt for other better available options for ordering. I wanted to upload the screenshots of their disaster service but cant find an option for the same. And I am not giving such a review based on one single experience but this has happened multiple times which has forced me to take such a step.,1
Horrible service. They say 30 minutes on the app and take 75 to deliver. Food becomes stone cold and inedible. Why do we have to pay delivery charges when they club multiple deliveries in one... my order travelled have of the financial district before reaching me...,1
"worst app. it doesnt give the direct option to cancel the order and even i cancelled the order within 2-3 mins of ordering , they refused to refund the money stating that you had to cancel thr order before restaurant acceptsthe order. Its so unfair. Being a regular customer it feels like cheating. Never going to order again through Zomato.",1
I had a really excruciating experience from Zomato today. My today's order for breakfast was delivered very late and beyond that the food was cold and frozen. The unhealthy condition of the food delivered was reported to the customer care executive and wasn't addressed to the value of loss that I had. The effort and energy I've spent for a single order from Zomato was in vain as I wasn't reimbursed to the value of my expense. Totally disappointed!,1
"A very bad experience with Zomato when it comes to refund. Cancelled my order on the 2nd August due to order not available, follow up on 7th August - refund was not process. Follow up again on 18th August and still NOT process. Then have to wait again for 7 days. Surely, they will extend up to few months before they release refund.",1
Amazing concept. Big offers. Help order quickly. Only issue it have is that it says 50% off for first 5 order. But it applies only on first order. Also when new user apply it says u are already an existing user. So coupon does not apply.,4
The promocode zomato new doesn't works. It worked only in the first order. It takes too long time to deliver the food as compared to other online food delivery mediums. Not satisfied with the service.,1
sabse sasta or tasty. must try once.,5
Worst app... They don't even allow you to cancel order. The chat team is very disappointing. When I requested to cancel my order they didn't. And when I refused to take it they said if I don't accept it they won't allow me to place order COD further and will deduct the amount in next order.,1
"Pathetic customer support. I have ordered for food today where i have already paid the entire amount in advance but i had received lesser items what i had ordered. When i check for customer support, there is no such options in Zomato app and my money has been forfeited. My suggestion is please check the foods before paying money.",1
"worst app, it is very slow I applied offer and ordered but offer didn't get applied due to its irritating slow. Then I asked for cancellation just a second after ordering in chat section, no reply for 8mins then I called delivery guy through him I contacted zomato then they told they are going to charge for cancellation, I asked them to not charge as I replied as earliest in chat section. They accepted that cancellation fees will not be put,but they are charging for next order. worst experience",1
Overall I am very much happy about this app. I using this almost every day. I have a suggestion to modify the app to choose a default address. Because in the app which is the last address you added will be the default address. I had encounteredwith problem a couple of times.,4
"i have never seen such an unorganized app. The first page itself is reflection of total mess. Swigy & uber r way beter & i would say, r clean app..the most problamatic feature is, whn it ask paymnt mode on same page of order & default slection of mode is COD. Once i mistakely presed PLACE ORDER tab thinking tht it will lead me to paymnts page but order ws alrdy placed in COD. I canceled the order in same minute but i ws being charged double to repeat the order. Hence i delted the confused app.",1
"You guys are asking users to rate your app incessantly even after the user has dismissed the pop up a zillion times. So irritating!! I actually started hitting ""Not really"" button on the pop up that asks ""Enjoying the Zomato app?"". And the pop up still comes every single time. Think this through guys!!! At least give me an option to say ""Don't ask me again""?",1
"this app's customer service is pathetic, had placed an order and received it almost 1hr40min later and the food was cold,had requested the customer service agent to cancel the order multiple times but to no avail and was asked to wait a bit more at 2:30am when asked to cancel the order, ot was a bad experience.",1
Swiggy is far better than this app when considering the customer care service. For serving your problem on their bot will interact with you! And the biggest diffrence between swiggy and zomato is zomato charges you for cancelling the order!but swiggy never! Really very poor service! They Need to improve their customer care service or else far better options are available than zomato,2
Dont know whether its the apps fault or the restaurants but received 1 incorrect order out of the 3 orders that i made. Upon calling the restaurant one time it was picked up then was refused to be picked up again. Same with the delivery boy even after giving him a tip. Look forward to such matters or else a hungry guy can bring up disastrous situation for the restaurant from where he/she might order.,2
very bad experience..food that i ordered was not there it was different. they told me that they'll give 100 credit in my account i next 24-48 hours after 4 days i got in touch with them..again they'll say 24 hours after that they'll say the repeat the same thing..just fooling customers,1
Great App i love this appppp 😘,5
I had a bad experience.. Ordered french fries from McD.. The food was delivered but later we noticed that the food was open.. When we reached the support.. They were not ready to replace the food.. They would just take it as feedback.. I dont want to eat a food which was open all the way from restaurant to my home in Bangalore.. I understand it would have happened by mistake.. But God knows what all went inside.. health is important.. Had high expectations.. Not going to use Zomato anymore..,1
i waited for more than a hour for my food and finally they cancelled it without my consent.... and asked the customer care regarding the issue and they suggest me to write a mail to there office and they will contact you within 24-48 hrs.. while I'm still hungry with no food with my money which was debited will be credited back within 24 hrs....,1
most of the time my instructions are not followed and all the time when i try to connect with the chat support team eaither i am unable to text them or i am unable to attach a picture as it hangs alot because of which one time i could share the picture of my food n couldn'tget refund...plus even after providing location of my delivery address still delivery guys will call and ask me where is this place i wonder why zomato even asks us our location when they dont even provide it to their riders,1
"I purchased the product along with order in which if there will be delay in order, it gives refund for full order payment. My order was delayed and after receiving it i am not getting any option to chat with customer services and no option for claiming my money back. At least they should give the refund for this fraud policy they are selling to customers.. very bad experience",1
What hell is this aap. This aap is a sacm. I buy food yesterday. After I get my food. The app is still showing me that your food is preparing. I thought it was happening sometimes. I close the app and then i repopen the app. I thought that it will not show if I repoen the app. But it still showing me that your food is preparing. I just close the app. I go for sleep. Next day I saw that I have only 400 rs in my account. They took all my money. I am trying to call the customer care but no nothing,1
"This is the worst app, I applied the FIRST50 coupon code, they initially allowed the discount but as I completed the address and other informations, they disallowed the discount and I had to pay for full amount and that too the delivery took more than 45mins. Horrible service by zomato",1
My order was not honored. One of the items from my first order wasn't delivered. I ordered the second time within 1 hour for replenishment and restaurant rep (Aman) promised that it would be sent with the second order. My first order was for 750ml of a particular dish...second was for 500ml. Both the orders came with the same quantity and same box... absolutely pathetic...Zomato - fix this,1
"A lot of issues has been resolved except for the order delivery. I would wish for a feature that will allow us to set time for delivery, as well as being notified 5-10 minutes before the delivery incase our residence happens to be a high rise apartment.",3
your service is good and fast...but i have seen a lot of reviews about refund issue and this is also happening with me . my refund is not initiated - its already a week going to end .. i am waiting for my refund . lol .i dont know what the hell u guys doing with everyone. if u cant refund money back then please dont take online money ... cancel that part from ur app forever . and do the cash on delivery only .,1
I order food with correct address they cancelled my order and not refunded my money back zomato is very worst app. I will never ever use this app for ordering and make sure my friends also don't use it. You are just taking money from Costumer and the service is worst. I am a student and how hard that to arrange money for me and that order sucks my money i heartly hated this app no one is helping me to getting my money back without any reason,1
"I would give it zero of I had the option. worst customer service ever. I had been given raw food from a restaurant and complained 23rd December 2018 and they said it would take sometime to rectify the solution today is February the 7th 2019...unacceptable. never using this app again . they dont even have customer call centre just some robot replying with that typical ""unfortunately "".",1
waste service in the world i was given the complaint in the month of February 2019 today 3-5-2019 still my issue it was not solved today in chat they telling me to mail. i dont know you service support what doing fron last 4months if ur team can't solve the issue from last 4months that what doing ur team (may be i think team is in holiday trip). i wasted my lot of time in doing order in Zomato,1
"The worst app one can ever have. They are just not able to handle anything. Very very worst experience. Zomato people should understand one thing that customer order food not the ""REFUND"". Just sending back the amount is not the solution dear. I will surely advise all of family, friends & everyone to please uninstall this app.",1
Horrible... Whenever they promote any offers....there site is completely down and if by chance you reach you get the massage that they are not accepting any orders. Then why they fool customer and waste there time?? Also I don't understand why I have been logged out from the app automatically.....and now I am even able to login...?? Really disappointing. Swiggy is a way better than Zomato.,1
This app is really good better swigy so download this now,5
"if you are lucky the listed restaurant will not be out of your ordered items and will prepare your food and with more luck the valet reaches picks up and delivers all as promised. But luck should not be the basis of what Zomato is promising. Bad choice of restaurants, not enough training or instructions to both zomato valet or participating restaurants, app menus are often not updated, insist on online payments for using zomato credits, 0 resolution for wrong food delivered",1
Excellent.... service on time,4
Hated the app and the process of placing order. Every time i order it made me write like 10 times the same thing as the app doesn't respond properly. Needs lots of developments in the area of its order processing software.,1
"Worst, I ordered food @9:40pm, my phone got switched off @10 ...I had given the address with my door number and I was waiting for the delivery to reach me till 11PM, No delivery guy reached near my house, when I asked for the money refund, they denied it saying it got cancelled n could not reach via phone, I argued with customer care saying atleast they could come to my house as I was waiting outside, all argument with Zomato was in vain.",1
"worst food ordering app I ever seen, they have cake delivery option and don't have option of putting message and no late delivery option. in all other food ordering app they will call to know the delivery timing. I have ordered the cake n zomato person told no option of late delivery, immediately I cancelled my order for that they charged whole amount 400 and I didn't get any food too. Please don't use this app for ordering.",1
Highly disappointed with Zomato service. I had ordered food from this app and cancelled it within seconds (not even 1minute) since wanted to add more items. Zomato cancelled my Order and they didnot refund it. When I called the restaurant they said the order is not yet confirmed. Later asked to deliver the food and reject my cancellation request to which they denied.Food and money both with them. If this is how they treat their customers then is not recommended. They even rejected a call support,1
Spent one hour trying to add a new card to the stupid app with no success.,1
"Disgusting app. I placed my order and it does not show relevant details like track order and the payment method was clearly stated, it showed failed attempt despite several clear placements, also the amount varied so many times. It was a sheer wastage of time and a complete user non friendly app.",1
it is the best app to order the food and it only shows the restaurants which are near . I just enjoy using this app . The most important app in every mobile .I always book from this app whatever I need to eat. Restaurants accept the order very fast,5
"Overall user interface is pretty good and also offer decent discounts all year round. One problem I faced was when food, of terrible quality, was delivered and when complaint about it, wasn't resolved satisfactorily.",4
such a fraud app dont use this app.. they will reject your order if you didn't pick call immediately just in 2 mins order will get rejec ted when you try to callback immediately also. and they will not refund you saying food was prepared .. have some sense if food was ordered and paid by user that means he need food and he will be in such situation that he was not able to pick call.. zomato you are just looting money that's it.,1
A useless application. I mean why it there in the market at all. You can only place order and cannot track the order. This app is of no use. I have made an order which is not delivered and money is not refunded.,1
This App has gone down in quality. They never deliver on time .and the customer service is not at all helpful.Also they must have hired all their delivery executives from some special school for morons because not one of them can understand directions . Going to uninstall the app ASAP.,2
App is nice but their parners were horrible. I have ordered veg noodles and fried rice from vaishali dhaba. Their food was very hot and was packed in an ordinary plastic cover which were used to cover loose sugar. App claiming that they were 100 % sealed but their partners even not using food grade sheet or an container.,3
Helps in maintaining privacy within ourselves,5
"This app is fraud guys! They charged me money for an order which they cancelled and said the money will be refunded withing 5 days but it has been 10 days no and I still didn't get my refund. When I chatted with the customer care support, a very pathetic robot like service btw, they asked me to talk to the bank and didn't take any responsibility at all!",1
I ordered food...last 2 times was bad experience...delivery time they mentioned 45 minutes but I waited more than 2 hour for order... Just now also I ordered food...they mentioned the time 8.57pm delivery time...but so far I didn't get the order...now time is.9.33pm pm...almost 1 and 1/2 hour... Please dont prefer zomoto for online order...they dont have any punctuality.. Poor service..,1
The behaviour of Zomato wallet was very rude..and executive was also careless..highly disappointed by zomato....Once again,1
"Very bad overall experience ! Order was placed and confirmed , after an hour , I recieve a call from the driver to wait an additional 45 minutes! customer service had been contacted , I had been transferred 3 different times! ( NO ONE SEEMED INTERESTED IN MY ISSUE) While even being transferred the second time the agent cut the call in which I had to call back again! Why accept the order send a message the item for delivery is on the way with the driver and tell to wait additional 45 minutes!",1
Very bad service. Called delivery man thrice he didnt pick up and they cancelled my order even after mailing the the proofs amount of times I called and spoke to delivery boy way before my order was rejected and didnt refund me. Did not even responded to my mails. Worst app! Use UBER EATS or COD (do not pay online they love to steal). Be careful!,1
worse service provider they did it twice that i placed the order and made online payment than order was not delivered saying my no. was not reachable and this case is always with online payment done and third time i noticed it personally the delivery executive kept waiting on gate without making any call and a message was received on phone saying ur no. was not reachable and person left with the order. and they never refund the amount for that undelivered order.,1
"The offer and discounts are misleading, Actually their is No discount Just false Adverts to bring customer, Taxes are High and Delivery charges are Also high, forcefully taking tips. Pathetic",1
"Its pathetic unreliable service. I would never recommend using this app. They take your order give updates like order accepted, food is being prepared, food is ready, our valet picked up, arriving soon at your door step, make you wait further then boom they cancel the order for false reasons. Pathetic jokers.",1
I have experienced that I stay 7 kms away from Karimnagar. I noticed that when I was at Karimnagar Honey Bees Restaurant beside Classic Restaurant near Circus Ground. Zomato Persons were taking parcels from Honey Bees but when I am searching through my residence Honey Bees is not at all being displayed in the Search Engine Dialogue box. Because I stay 7kms away you Zomato does not provide services to me. Highly appreciated for this at the same time disappointed too.,1
products are stale and not fresh from hangout hiranandani estate Thane outlet ..not sure about other branch,2
Rude customer care staff and poor service. They cancelled order after waiting for 50 minutes. Its better cook and eat than depending on this service. And after they cancel the order it takes 7 days to refund money. Don't order if that's all the money you have. You may have to starve for 7 days till the time you receive the refund.,1
"Third class app, not able to get order details",1
Really like the recommendations and screening of the restaurants as per cuisine. The app is user friendly and has an excellent interface. Delivery boys are prompt and the service centre is extremely responsive. Also excellent foo coupons on offer.,5
"UX and UI good, please try to change the position of added card details which shows at bottom, beside to place order button, as when a new user want to switch to other card, he/she might not understand or cannot find easily where to add new card or make payment with other card.",5
"Made the huge mistake of updating the app. Now it always crashes when I open the app. It comes with a message saying ""Something went wrong, please try later"". I expected better from Zomato",1
"Such a BAD service. Sometimes the items are missing from the order. Sometimes the order gets delivered 4-5 hours later. Sometimes the food gets delivered cold. I suggest to use Deliveroo, Careem or Ubereats. Zomato team don't care about the time, money or satisfaction of the customer.",1
worst app... couldn't be trusted... Many times I the manual they upload is different from what it is actually in the restaurant... Vast difference in prices... And also favours the restaurants a lot... any complaint that is given is not taken seriously!!,1
I really liked this application. I'm kind of new to the idea of ordering food online but it's actually great. No need to talk and explain. Everything is very organized. I like it when I can make customization without the hassle of explaining over the phone. I just wonder if I am can see restaurants in a different area without having to do a search of a specific restaurant.,5
this app is good to use...but we can't cancel the order if we want....why will i pay for such an order which hazards my schedule...i dont have much time to wait for the restaurant confirmation....i feel restless..please let us cancel the order if the restaurant takes time to accept our order...please look upon my request,2
this is the worst application ever. the restaurant cancel the order but the money will be added to the next order. so you need to pay the money for the food you haven't received. this is seriously a very pathetic service. i recommend you all to go look at the order such type of application.,1
Such a shame that Zomato delivery agent are posting food delivered on the app even before they deliver food at your location. Recently had incidence with my order where the the delivery agent posted food delivered on app. And delivered food way after that. How are we going to believe on Zomato delivery from now on if this becomes commonplace.,1
I had a unplesant experience with them. I had an order cancelled from a Pizza Store but have not received any Refunds from them since 15 days! I tried contacting but they don't have Customer Care No.! Instead they have a AI chat which gives Limited questions & specifix Answers. Still figuring out how do I get my money back,1
Everything is all right with the app BUT your delivery charge is very high. Therefore I at times have to switch other apps to ask for a food delivery. That's pathetic! So please think about it. Thanks!!,3
"I have ordered food many a times from this app and experienced very bad and poor quality food. Very poor chain of restaurants and outlets. There is no option of writing the complaint on help desk in the app. After choosing the option, executive writes only for apology. I do not suggest to use this app for ordering food delivery.",1
"This a good food delivering app than the other apps. If they are not able to deliver something, they inform you way sooner than other apps. The thing I like the most is they keep giving discounts and offers. Keep it up guys.",5
"No customer support services. If your restaurant phone is not reachable then you can't do anything.just like me what am i facing right now almost 2 hours over and i don't know, where is my order and from almost 1 hour and 45 minutes it's showing , your order is on the way.",1
"This app used to be my favourite but now its adding charges in the name of taxes which was not there just a month back nd delivery charges I think zomato dont even check dist btw restaurant nd home the restaurant which is just at 2min walking dist they show 20Rs delivery charge that also I mean the management system of this app is going crazy if this thing will go on , I think downfall is not so far then.",1
Waste and worst service.. It gives offers and those restaurants and food courts are cheating customers with quality less food and their strategic manner. They said no restaurant is charged above the price which is on menu but while delivery it is too high with quality less food. I faced a prblm that ordered food and it was delayed 1hour so I want to canceled but they said u have to pay for that as penalty wt the stupid thing it is I didn't get items I don't know whether it is prepared or not,1
worst experiences. I ordered twice on this app. First time first order got automatically cancelled so I have to order from another restaurant all these things taken about an hour. Second time restaurant accepted the order but they unable to assign any person for half an hour and finally my order got cancelled by the Zomato. They aren very quick the amount but make you wat for half hour and finally say that there is one problem or other. Worst service in Lucknow at least.,1
"Got the issue solved,got a call from the customer support after 30 minutes and the issue was solved Regarding the experience i had.the customer support is of no use,at first they enquired the issue on the chat asked me for few minutes to get checked and later no reply came.i had ordered a veg combo but had received an non-veg item and upon that they dont even revert back to our issue.does the company dont have basic responsibility of reverting back to the issues.hope it improve its customer suprt",3
Customer support is very bad they even don't care about customer concerns regarding wrong item delivery or late delivery issues they don't care. Delivery charges and Tax charges are more. If your order 120₹ item you will be taxed from restaurant ₹50+ excluding deleiver charge +40 extra. Final cost for your 120₹item will ordered in zomato for 210 ₹.,1
The services were amazing at the beginning but now it is deteriorating.Nowadays all i do do is order food and receive something else or at times missing items and demad for refund or credit.And with my recent orders i lost my money and also no refund or credits were added and when demanding for credit they would be like wait till the next 24 to 48 hours and as days pass u won't get any. I have never written a bad review about any of the apps but now i m fed up with their services.,1
"The worst food delivery service I have experienced till now. They dont even maintain restaurant standards, even add restaurants without proper scrutiny or checking how the restaurant is. I have ordered from various restaurants in this app but could receive only very bad food or food cooked long back or even stale food. This app has the worstest customer care service, they dont even respond even after waiting for 60min, and we cant even cancel the order as we paid online. Dont go for it.",1
"After the update, a lot of options are missing. The block for zomato easy; breakfast, lunch or dinner and desserts is no where to find. The one and only this which I loved about the app was to order food 1 click away is now not even there.",1
After the latest update im not getting the option of cash on delivery. Is it just an error or the app has removed this option.,4
Unexpected delay in delivering order,1
They will ask restaurant guys to deliver the order nowadays. And if something wrong gets to your order Zomato don't take the responsibility. For order tracking you have to call the restaurant and for any delays you have to deal with the restaurant. They are simply charging delivery amount which is roughly Rs. 70 for an order of Rs. 200 and doing nothing. Better call up the restaurant directly and get it delivered through them. You will end up saving delivery charges and taxes that ways.,1
Extremely happy with the app. It is very convenient to use and the delivery also meets expectation. Just a small thing that I didn't like is the people who took my order totally gave the wrong phone number in my bill. Other than that I like it very much. Kudos to y'all😎👍,5
I am facing issue with your chat support. you don't have any customer support number and on chat support they are always do same reply that we are not authorised for your concern. this type of response will impact your customer base. I was using zomato since 18 months but now i am going to uninstall this pathetic app.,1
Horrible app and horrible Zomato. I ordered pizza and delivery person declined to deliver food. I tried support option and no one respond me and smartly person marked my order as deliver. support team reached to me next day and say we wont refund. Such a pathetic app and team. Never gonna order from this app ever. They dont even deserve a single star.,1
"I had a horrible experience with my last order. When i paid for order with my sodexo card, it gave error message as payment failed and money got deducted for twice. I went to online ordering help and found that this money will be refunded. Hence i have tried for 3rd time with other payment option. I finally surprised to see that all the 3 orders are accepted and i have got 3 times the same food.",1
Pathetic service.. When I ordered food for me for the first 20 min it showed me that my food is being prepared and then suddenly it showed that my order has been cancelled it is the worst ever service by any food delivery app till now ... Now I'm gonna stick to swiggy as it has the best service at least they provide you food and not just cancel it,1
I wish if there any option to give zero star rating.My Cash on delivery option is banned iam writting email after email but getting the same reply for all and the problem is also not solved. If you are not able to resolve the problem of the users than plz dont run any app like this.As a regular User of this app Iam really unsatisfied and sad by your customer care Service.,1
"Customer Service is very slow to respond, Delivery Guys don't have any concern about delivering the ordered food to the customer instead, they advice me to call the customer care and cancel the order. Check my previous complaints,I've stopped using your services for a long time because of these issues I had with you before. There's no improvement with you services.",1
"The upgrade to ""Zomato Pro"" is more like a downgrade. 1+1/2+2 has been discontinued. This was probably the only thing which differentiated Zomato from competitors. Instead this Zomato pro is a poor impersonation of Swiggy. Swiggy is giving much bigger discounts, added discounts under their ""birthday "" celebration and ""Party"" code on special occasions. Plus ""Super"" subscribers do not pay delivery charges! A big 👎 to Zomato for duping subscribers, shame on u.. Switching to Swiggy permanently.",1
Guys don't order tha food in zomato and sweggy..y becouse I noticed that delivery little bit k but there is zomato office person's they are very bad talk and usless answers sm times so they delivery person waited 1 hour to receive tha food after 1. Hour I got Cal from zomato office that they are saying ur order is not placed..after 5 mints i got a call from delivery person he said sir I collect tha food wat happend ur has been canceled...so finally delivery person is responsible but zomato is no,1
"App is good, offers are pretty good many a times. Sometimes restaurants missmange the orders, happened to me few times and had to cancel the order because of delays of 1 hour or so. customer care helps quickly and refunds are processed in few days. mostly the experince good",4
very poor customer services and map doesn't work according to our address. if we add correct address then map pickup another location and show wrong location to rider. Many time I'm facing this problem but problem still. So i switch this app and find another better app,1
Very bad expereince. The delivery took more than 1:30 mins and late delivery has gappened several number of times. The customer support are also insensitive to your concerns and lack basic logic and sense. It will loose out to other delivery apps for sure with such employees.,2
"Zomato is perhaps the oldest app that I had installed on my phone when they first made a foray into bringing the food to my doorstep instead of me visiting newly opened restaurants to try out different dishes. Being a foodie I guess I have quite a lot of apps that is revolving around food, thus, had to create a folder titled ""TLC"" for it. TLC being my favourite channel.",5
"Sad to say, their delivery service sucks. Not only the prices were not updated in the system. Moreover, I had to wait triple the time than the estimated time. I waited for my food 1 and a half hours.",1
Zomato doesn't have a Customer Care Number to contact them after an hour of waiting for your food delivery. Chat support doesn't reply as well and you are left wondering whether to order again or wait while you starve to death! Plus the fact that your card is debited! This is a BAD SITE TO BE AT!!!,1
Not able to track delivery. No call backs recieved to inform orders will be late. Very poor service. And the chat also does not allow us to raise complaints on our own. Its all pre-programmed options. Uber eats is way better.,1
This is the best food delivery app,5
"Pathetic app, they are trying to copy swiggy but they are no way closer to them. App doesn't work properly, unable to see order history in app, unable to chat with customer support as all this page appears blank. Unable to track real time status of order delivery",1
offers and services are ok..but the app should have to update ..with cancellation option .before accepting orders by shops .if ordered by mistake. and need to specify branch of shop accepting order in case more branches .by mistake ordered far away branc h of a shop while having a nearby branch.,2
"Worst experience. They do not provide any assistence to customer, only chat option is available. I order my food but they did not deliver. And app was showing your order is preparing. I waited for 3 hour. But my problem not resolved",1
Nice food delivery company.,5
"Seriously,its been one month you have deducted my amount twice and didn't pay the refund,everytime i contact the customer service they are saying that they are trying their best.If at all they are trying their best,the problem would have solved earlier.",1
"Unfortunate and disappointed with the services. I guess customers are not valuable to you guys. Mishandling of the order done by the delivery boy- restaurant has packed well - reaches to customer in a bad state - customer returns it to the restaurant. Emailed to u guys with photos n details. Instead of the refund of amount of 339, luring the customer with discount of 84 rupee.. Seriously 🤐. Customer ka paisa bhi rakhlo aur order bhi. No wonder their might be millions who Wud have suffered same",1
Kindly do not accept zomato and its services. We are 2 years old customer with 4 different numbers. Same address and same mobile used always. Last time his delivery boy did not reached at my destination where all time they reached easily and they said to zomato that i was not in location and my number was not reachable. I was also tried zomato delivery boy. I did not get his phone number and they said my number was not reachable. They illegally charged my 117 rupees.,1
horrible experience..the customer support is worst.they never respond in time..never use this app for online payment.they never refund and they dont serve the food after online payment..if its delivery boys mistake..if he doesn't picks the call n not deliver after online payment..the customer support charges cancellation charge even if its not customers fault.. worst application and worst customer support..they never help,1
The worst experience with zomato app. Cancellation charges are same has order value. List of Menu was showing the dishes which restaurant won't provide/prepare. After the declination from restaurant I had canceled it. They have charged cancellation charges as order value.,1
As an app to locate nearby food joints it is a five star app. But as far as food ordering is concerned.. They don't take an iota of responsibility for it. Unlike other apps like uber eats they just deny any responsibility and would ask to contact restaurant for everything.,2
"Horrible service. They just cancel orders whenever they want and the refund, if at all, comes weeks later. Its pathetic. I would give them a ZERO if i could. The customer service is not helpful at all.",1
"A humble request to my near and dear ones,please dont use this app, i am telling it as per my personal experience, at many instants the have deducted money and have not delivered the items due to innovative reasons by chat support team. Very bad experience , they dont even reply if its their fault.Untrained staff and delivery boys, they take customers as granted. thank you",1
"App is only based on sms otp. it should be optimised for manual input of otp received by email. Now, when minimising Zomato page to read email otp, the zomato page closes on minimising. it should open at oto page when maximising after reading tge email otp. The tele number of restaurant is incorrect, as it does not connect. late delivery.",1
"very good services....but app should be improved n service regarding real time should be maintained...it has to give one minute time to cancel order after placed that seems good for all customers, chat support need to be cancelled bcoz it will take too much time to reply.",4
"Worst ever food delivery experience.I placed an order. Paid money in advance. Expected delivery time was 30 mins. I waited for almost 1 hour. Then in application it showed food has been delivered to you though i got no food. I tried contacting the valet, restaurant, zomato support team but all of my efforts gone in vein. Even i didn't got my money back. Think twice before you risk your meal through zomato.",1
"it is the worst app for dealing with customers regarding problems from order, for instance i had ordered food from one restaurant and they had brought the wrong one here i had dealt even with customer service he had been solving for one day and i had got nothing in return either food or money back and the service said it will take time for this and it has been 1 day till now",1
Unbeatable service very fast delivery Hotel&Restarent also Good yummy food assowome keka Super,5
"Customer support is very poor,with limited pre defined issues,its better to call the restaurant directly for home delivery rather than ordering on zomato.menu and coupons keep fluctuating and updating every minute,very difficult to place oder after updating to latest version.",1
"Worst Delivery service, Neither the delivery knows how to talk and nor they reach proper address. I had given more than 30 orders and every time I have to go to different landmarks near my home... They always bring cold food.. Maybe there is option available for 0 stars..",1
"Amazing company! First, the delivery person forgets the order at the restaurant, great! Then they go back and get an opened package and the food is all cold. Contact customer support and they crack jokes instead of helping you out! I'm truly done with this app 🙏",1
Zomato experience has been wonderful... Usually we do not have to wait for a long to take a bite of our ordered delicacies... The food reaches within an hour.. Even the service is friendly... Zomato keeps transparency with its users... It was fun to have access to our favs at fair prices,5
Best and hygienically transports the foods,5
"Pretty good when you don't get the order confirmation, they call the hotel/restaurant themselves and confirm it for you good service, the food orderer through zomato so far has been really good as well and the best thing punctualitly - they deliver it at the said time.",5
The worst food delivery app one can hope for. The customer care is lethargic and has nothing to do with care of customer. The restaurant mentioned on the app don't adhere to the time prescribed on app for delivery and on top of it have the audacity to give the enquiry call a miss. Really disappointed with what kind of service you provide.,1
I received coupons in phone pay but Coupons are not working,3
"Zomato has reached the lowest possible status of worst customer service. This is the 5th time I have placed an order for which I have been waiting for more than 50mins than the mentioned delivery time and their customer service is completely disastrous. Today I placed an order at 6.18pm, it's 7.38pm and the order is still not delivered. The customer service rep wants to cancel the order and refund after making me wait on the chat for almost 40mins. Pathetic is an understatement for this!",1
"Pathetic service, i installed app today - phone numbers of Dominon on zomato app not working, no delivery information available, delivered in 1 hours and then food quality-pizza cheese burst with hardly any cheese and chocolate lava cake packing leaking with all chocolate flowing out. And when i put a complaint, they have no resolution.",1
Earlier we guys used to get one dish free on another but now you guys have converted gold into pro which gives hardly any discount and customers who took zomato gold membership are really in loss. We guys wont get one dish free ideally instead you guys have smartly giving just 15 to 20 percent discount which is not right. Pathetic decision taken by you guys and not a happpy customer at all. I would like to highlight to everyone not to buy zomato gold membership as its useless and not worth.,1
2 stars even though i love this app. low rating simple because you can't rate and share your zomato experience everytime you place an order. You can only rate the delivery guy and the restaurant; Zomato plays a crucial role and needs to be rated as well.,2
"Still the same...Zomato Gold member but not that great experience either on dinout or delivery. The customer service is negligible and delivery person not having common sense. Item get cancelled, delivery get cancelled, zomato gold not accepted any many place or have restriction... Better to go for only delivery Swiggy and Dineout for only restaurant booking with better deals.",1
"Very poor delivery time, it took more than an hour to deliver my order plus your clock does not seems to work in accordance to world time your 45 minutes is more than 75 minutes. Please do not lie to your customer.. Just to earn few bucks plus you also charge delivery charges and not deliver on time which is promised on order",1
"Patetic service their delivery boy are worse,they dont call you and deliver your food to other addresses, happened to me twice no customer service where you can call and get your complaint registred. Never pay in advance to them always pay when you get your order they are worse in refunds and cutomer service . You are going to my uninstall list",1
really relish the dishes of various restaurants provided by zomato....it is only because of zomato i taste so much cuisines... really happy and satisfied by the its services as well...plus there is this offer thing always available with these offers the food u get becomes less expensive as well as exotic... go for ot guys..,4
"Had the most absurd experience today. The customer support rep says that they don't have control on what the restaurant packs. so, if the order is different from what you ordered, accept a small refund of credit and they will keep the money as it was prepaid.",1
The service of this app is very bad. Even I have complained about one order they did not respond properly. As its a msg based support you can't do anything to them. If you order for full you will get half.,1
It took 1 hours 50 minutes to deliver the order. The zomato help line or the chat does not work. Worst experience. However the team zomato took the responsibility of the delay and gave the order value credit. Which is really prompt and appreciated.,5
Zomato gold is just a hoax. You will be fool if you are buying it. You can never save money using that. For example you cart value is ₹210 after unlocking gold the tax and other charges will be around ₹90 which is really a good trick applied. In name of gold they grab money from tax and other services and you won't save more than ₹50. As nearly you will end up giving nearly same amount which they had given second item which they tag as free. Don't fall in that trap by paying ₹1800 not even₹1000,1
Worst experience at Zomato.I was charged a tip by default before even I opted for it. In hurry no one checks what is selected and and what is not by default. I have given tip earlier as well but after the order was done and best on my satisfaction. Zomato has found a new way of charging customers.,1
"If you place an order for the wrong address in error, theres no way you can update it... Only option is to cancel the order and loose the whole amount... No cancellation but the whole order amount....This is seriously cheating!!! I am never using zomato again.",1
"The service is always good with zomato, but the app can be a little more clean. Right now, there is too much clutter that can be reduced to improve the user experience. Otherwise the app works perfectly.",4
Not helpful persons.... app have some problems.. i just clicked my promo code and.. amount changed... when i pay the money online... they took full cash of the items.. no discount.. then i contact assistant and they said u will get fiscount on another order.... they cant help.. its zomato is full responsible for this.... please check wher ur paying online.. kondu poyi thinnada ninta discount.... bad bad very bad i will not order again.,1
"I have been using zomato app for quite a long time now and have an amazing experience. Even their support is quite good. Discounts, offers and fast delivery is just icing on the cake. All my fav restaurants are listed in Zomato.",5
"i ordered sweets from this app and was unable to reach my phone when the delivery boy called and the company charged me penalty of whole amount as they say that food got wasted,but sweets have expiry of one day how could it got wasted in an hour . It was a terrible experience , I am never gonna use this app again and suggest my whole friend circle to uninstall it .",1
"chat support is very poor. I am waiting from past 30 minutes nobody responded. Also, I placed an order it accidentally got cancelled and when I am trying to reach got no response, there is no contact number shared also order money got deducted as cancellation fee chat support once was the quickest now it has degraded to another level",1
i loved this app totally!! their offers are so amazing and u cud get food at such affordable prices from restaurants at any corner of your city and their customer service never dissatisfies.! and about the latest version - How do we go to our profile page? have u ppl forgot to add the link to profile where i cud see my uploaded photos n reviews?,5
Such a worst app. They get my order and deducted amount but further declined due to delivery resource not available and telling your amount will be refunded in 5-7days...what a cheating of this...if someone hve dont money further and ordered in hungry and u cancelled and refunding in 7 days...should they in fasting for that night...atleast you can change this policy to add those in wallet or something to reorder again to use that amount....Worst app ever i experienced....,1
The chat support is basically a waste. Orders run really late like i have an order around 9:40pm and its 10:55 still food haven't arrived. Distance between my place and the restaurant from which i ordered my food shouldn't take more than 25 mins So such a waste app.,1
Zomato takes lesser time for the delivery and behaviour of the delivery man so polite that this cannot be described in words. Actually the members of zomato are well trained and efficient for their work . So I would suggest everyone if you can then give five star to zomato app make it the best app in its route ..........,5
"Fast delivery. Though Packaging depends on resturants , yet delivery guys handle everything carefully. Of course sometimes price seems higher than that of actual resturant's price... But its affordable. So guys... Go for it. Dont forget to apply promocode. :)",4
"It's not save to use your credit card with this app I had payment issue and I found that they dont have customer service only you can contact by email, then they showing will reply from 24 till 48 hours to check my complain, but 4 days now and no one contact with me , very poor service not same like careem or talabat",1
"terrible ,i ordered food on 1:40 pm , after 4 hours also they are neither delivering nor refunding , the customer care service is very poor , they are not even replying, the order status on zomato app says your order is being processed even after 4 hours and when i called delivery guy he told it has been cancelled, zomato customt care very bad . i suggest not to use this app for ordering",1
Delivery time is increasing upto an hour. A simple order from a nearby restaurant is taking more than the required time as delivery boys are loaded with multiple orders. Time shown in the live tracking is also wrong. A regular but frustrated customer,2
Horrible Experience. I decided to order food for my family on Zomato. Placed the order and got a confirmation of acceptance from the hotel. the delivery guy was never assigned to the order even after 30 minutes. I tried to continuously chat with the executive but they did not provide any solution even after 30 minutes of chatting.finally they blamed that there was a technical glitch and offered no solution. My family was left starving for the afternoon. Finally swiggy came to rescue. I ordered something quick and they delivered in the next 15 minutes. Thank you Zomato for spoiling my Sunday. Guys please be aware of this kind of experience before you order.,1
Dont use zoamto for food ordering. They dont have any obligation and customer satisfaction. I had experienced while ordered food was taken to some other location due to their techical problem. the delivery boy resufed to come exact my location and told me to come and collect from his location. Even customer care expert also request him to do so.. He did not.. So i m deleting the app now. so please care while booking through zomato.,1
horrible app in terms of customer service. no option available to cancel the order in case of delays. the customer support executive responds to chat only after 30 mins to inform that the order can be cancelled only without refunds. horrible policy.,1
"They delayed delivery for my order because they clubbed it with another order which was 10km away from my home. Restaurant itself is within 5km. I called the valet after app kept delivery time as 15 minute for 20 minute. He told me he is going somewhere else and it would take sometime. I had no choice but to cancel the order. Now they are refusing a refund. So, I paid them advance, to wait, follow up and get nothing!",1
"The new update sucks. It is not user friendly at all. I was searching for a restaurant in the food delivery section but it took me to visit places, there was no menu to be selected. Also, the worst part of this update is Zomato eazy which used to be my saviour is no more there. I was an avid zomato user but now no more",1
"My experience was a very bad. I ordered food on 13th November, My delivery address was correct, but food not delivered and said I delivered only according to pin code, and said, it was system issue so we take your ordered. And not refund. What was my mistake?",1
"order placing &payment process is very easy ,but sometimes delivery man denies the duty due to distance between the restaurant &home it has happed a couple of times with me &sometimes there are mistakes with the order ex. my one veg soup was replaced by a nin veg soup . Restaurants don't read extra instructions .All over its good",4
"The Experience was very much good with zomato . Very good delivery timing . Tasty and hot food 😋😋😘🍕🍕🍔🍟 but , I have given four star because at night there is a problem with it , it doesn't shows any restaurant at night and no food service is available at that time .",4
"1st they show us thousands ads about 50% off on 1st order, but they cant even give discount on 1st order. There is always some error which says that u r not a new user and u can never use the code and they cheat a lot in money also.... Like if the delivery guy cancels the order then u can get back ur money also so its a total loss of money and they cheat a lot to customers.",1
There service is very bad I ordered 13pizza and they delivered only 10 and they denied to refund me back and say lies also😢😢,1
"Always have faced bad experience, zomato just seek people's attention, but in real it's coupon never gets applied, they don't survey restaurants, they just need there part of incomes, they give a coupon to apply before 11am, when the restaurant itself opens after 11am. They are just fooling people nothing else. Zomato kindly improve ur services orelse u will be going downgrade. Nd plz educate ur customer service executives. They don't give any helpful services ever.",1
Iam almost regular customer of pizza planet... And always order on same home address which i have written on ur app... Today i gave three orders on same address.... Two with case on delivery and one online payment... Two with case on delivery reached on same address with no issue... But for which i delivered online ur customer service made an issue that address is not owk... And in cancellation of order payment won't be refund... Waht the game u people are making to make people fool...,1
"Using it since it cane into existence. Chopped and changed over the years,new interfaces and features kept on coming and going, but they still got lot of range of restaurants and less delivery charge and night delivery and awesome customer support. Its really a matter of pride for me that its made in India, i hope it keeps growing on and on",5
"It's too cluttered. With so many things on the portal it becomes time consuming and annoying to navigate the app. Also, the new feature of videos etc is quite useless and again just a distraction for the user who wants to order food without any hassle.",1
From last few days I am facing issue with 1. Delivered food will not be in a proper condition 2. Spoiled food 3. Charging extra 4. No proper customer service 5. Late delivery In short Zomato is application which is just to make money from customer without satisfying them.,1
"Great app to order or go have a joyous and scumptious food Apparently finding places is always a tedious job to hungry folks like me .This is so helpful by just seeing the reviews , budget in my pocket too 🤣 and book a cab or take a bike rush to location. additionally have a happy tummy and come back home.And privilege to zomato gold.Woah liked it",5
Love to use this app for online food order,5
"Worst service, if you applies some higher savings coupon for first time they will cancel your order and told that some issue but next time you cannot use the same code and they put simply blame on restaurant. I got order cancels from same restaurant by Zomato and same order in same restaurant I recieved from other delivery service. How can people cheat customers like this",1
"The rates marked against items are very high as compared to restaurant rates , after that charging taxes also. Like at a restaurant one item is of Rs 50 with tax and here I m getting it at 90 without tax and with tax it's around 110. More than double the price difference . Making us fool.",1
Experience is good. I recommend this over Swiggy which I find quite tedious to navigate even though they have a simpler UI. All payment methods including Sodexo are supported which is great. Customer satisfaction and response to queries or disputes is very fast thanks to the AI chatbot which predicts 99% of the time correctly about the problems I face. A truly refined product. A tip: get pro only if you order more than twice a month. Otherwise it is not financially worth it.,5
Burst services show differnt and serve different and always increase our delivery time and delivered too late and sometimes delivered stale food etc. When i raised complain on it sometimes they give us solution and sometimes told us u review on restaurants. Why we review on restaurant because restaurant not responsible for delivery. Support agent are not helpful.,1
"Very Bad Experience. I am very sorry to tell you zomato service is now really bad. We used to order using zomato always. But for last few orders, zomato is not maintaining their quality in service.For last 2 orders, the restaurant people missed the order and when we were trying to contact zomato people through chat and mail, we got an arrogant response. The same repeated after 2 days also. Horrible experience. We won't use zomato anymore",1
"waste app, can't Track the movement of food. Even option to call the delivery person is not there in the app. sometimes, have to wait for a long time for the food to get delivered. Swiggy and Uber eats provide better services.",1
"very good app, gives you the option to add extra items on your order and also gives option for adding tip and can also rate the hotel and delivery service. I am very happy and satisfied.",5
"Doesn't respect privacy settings. i kept opting out of receiving notifications until all options were a no, still kept receiving notifications. Deleted my account, still kept seeing notifications. They never stop and I no longer care how great the rest of the app is if they can't respect my privacy settings.",1
"Worst experience with this app and worst support. Other food delivery apps are way better. I received my food in disgusting condition and after hours when I finally got connected to a support person what he offered me was 15₹ coupon as a replacement to my 200₹ order l, my time, my energy. Thank you Zomato 🙏",1
"I have a Zomato gold and the experience has been so far good. But because of some unreliable services like dominos pizza in them I'm giving them 1 star. Dominos has no contactable number, no delivery person details, no customer care and takes hours to deliver. Zomato has no control over it. More such cases I'll stop using Zomato altogether.",1
"Worst app, help is useless they will only give options and u to select one example: for wrong item sent they will say discount coupon next time or feedback, if u select coupon they will give u some 100rps coupon where u won't be able to apply it on top of free coupon which is wroth of 80rps that means they are giving u 20rps for there mistake and making you shut, such kind of cheating customercare service. Totally disappointed with zomato being pro member they can't even do justice for pro membe",1
"I ordered today and very disappointed...there is no customer care...even zomato chat doesnt have any option on which you can send your messages...they have given you limited options to select for complaining. Order was so bad, poor taste and cold...seems it has given 4 5 hours old burger. Worst exprience ever.",1
"Worst service Doesn't even deserve one star They cancel your order and doesn't provide any refund. If you chat with customer service people, they will chat as if they are only there to copy paste same chat again and again and doesn't respond properly. Worst service,never use this app",1
"It's probably the best app to order food or check out about the restaurants in your city. The reviews and rating are such you can rely upon. But there is some glitch because of which for some restaurants it keep on showing not accepting orders but if your refresh it after couple of minutes, it will take order.",4
"Delivery Time, the one thing you look in a food is arbitrary. The delivery time is different before and after placing the order and not in a good way. The CustomerCare is of no help at all. You're better of with deliveroo or Uber eats",1
Pathetic service.... I have been waiting for more than 1 hr and the app shows that it will take 13 more minutes to deliver my food.. . I also called btw and they told me that the food already been picked by the delivery boy half hour ago.. . Now ur delivery boy has switched off his phone,1
its a good app for ordering purpose but they have to check and verify all the restaurant which they all are covering in. as many restaurant has keep the price of food high and giving in less quantity. Even after that the phone number what they have provided for restaurant in not correct .,1
One star is because of the chat support. It is really really very bad. No way to cancel an order. They mention an executive will get in touch but nothing for last 45 mins. I know I am writing a complaint here but I don't see any other option.,1
They don't have to anything to say or do apart from apologies. Once your order went wrong they will ask you to wait a call from restaurant and then restaurant ppl will start begging. Its better to call directly to the restaurant by taking their number from Google as they don't even charge delivery. In a day my two orders delivered with missing items and one with spoiled food but Zomato does not have any thing to do apart from the apologies.,1
"Worst app and company! I had ordered food and even after debiting the amount , did not recieve the food. Also could not talk to the customer care because there is no customer care calling service available. It's almost a fraud scenario. Please be careful while ordering from them.",1
I bought Gold Membership.. What a waste.. Online it doesn't make sense.. U get some deals here or there anyways.. I paid 1800 bucks.. The Vouchers they gave me disappeared without them reminding me within a month.. 5 vouchers with literally not much saving as the discount works our as much as the voucher cost.. So would have used only when there were no discounts available..,1
Love this more than swiggy❤😇,5
This app is a bug. Not at all user friendly. It doesn't even gives a proper menu of each restaurant. Menu of each restaurant are just pictures We'll have to go through each picture and know what is the menu,1
Very bad service. I had ordered kfc wednesday special meal. The menu shown on app is mismatching with that of the restaurant. Shown 10 hot and crispy and 6 strips 2 pepsi cans on app but kfc told me it is wings and strips only. Another thing the delivery was so delayed i had to cancelled ultimately. I m never ordering with zomato. swiggy is better.,1
"Payment Gateway Failure i.e You pay for Zomato Gold but you don't get any of the discounts as the payments won't go through, so you end up paying full price anyway. Also, customer service is of zero help as they don't detect the Payment Failure and therefore can't give you a refund.",1
Takes longer time in accepting the order and response is not good in getting reply from zomato as compared to other food apps. Not even get any refund till now from zomato for my negative feedbacks. So better use uber eats where you get refund within a hour. the service is worst the food is totally spoiled and getting smell still no response I get until I mailed regarding the issue I got refund of 21 rupees which I give 20-30 to the delivery as a tip please don't expect a Good service from zomato,1
There is total chaos in your new app interface it was good during past time. Now its totally been fake..like resturants which show in the banner of 50%off only 2 resturants are there which are actually on 50%off..others do not accept coupon but they are in banner of off. Same with combo category..Guys atleast verify before putting resutrants in off banner that they work or not. Your competition swiggy far better in this concern,1
the staff and service at zomato is pathetic ..majorly at every sunday what they do is they will tell you that your GPS address is showing wrong and your address is a few kilometers ahead of it ..so that the customer shall offer the extra charge for delivery ..and if the customer doesn't do so they will cancel the order and in the next order they shall charge you the amount of the previous order. The staff just doesn't seem to help the customer.,1
earlier is was food but now its worst experience so many times and even just now also i booked an order 45 minutes before and no confirmation is there...money deducted right on time and delievery ....even they dont provided me any compensation for their side mistake....awful....no postive response from customer chat also,1
"Promotional offer very good,. I enjoyed ordering food through zomato... I really appreciate to zomato team.. I strongly recommend to everyone. Pro: 1.less charges on delivery and taxes 2.lot of offers 3.lot of promotion code 4.food prices are less compare to others. Cons: Delivery boys r not professional 😂..",5
"Good. But some of the time its shows currently not accepting orders, which erates the most. Now they have started raise in all food items than the actual cost mentioned in menu. Also they apply additional charge approx 20-30 per order.",4
Best App For Food Delivery👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼,5
"A very pathetic customer care assistance and solutions are provided by this application customer care portal and also they have kept very illiterate, uncouth people who have no idea about finding an address through navigation. Also the restaurants being linked by them offer very poor quality food.",1
"Extremely poor service. Happened to me twice. They took my money and didn't deliver the food and when asked about it, they said you were 'unresponsive' when I wasn't even contacted. Not even once. I'll not recommend anyone to place a paid order.",1
"best service,good staffs",5
Ordering the food is not at all easy and very time consuming. just to order the food it took me over 45 mins. offers are not applied or the servers are not allowing access anyways it's a waste of time.,2
Loading menus on this app is incredibly slow. And the fact that the website forces mobile users to download the app in order to view the menu is quite frustrating and infuriating. Would not recommend at all.,1
Can work on search results. There is no option in which i can browse all the eateries of my city at once and sort it according to ratings or price. This option was available before. But now it shows places only near to me.,4
"the food was prepaid and the delivery boy couldnot contact me due to network issue and they returned the food to restuarant and deducted my whole money as penalty, when i requested to redeliver since the delivery boy was in transit, they refused. a new way to steal your money and food both. horrible experience no customer care number to talk just chat which is also unprofessional",1
"This app failed to recognise my exact location , also didn't allow me to enter my address. It mixed up the area names which are 3 kms apart. It will make the delivery persons work a lot difficult and also me getting the food very late. Guys, invest on GPS instruments. Your rival does it very efficiently. You failed here.",2
"Worst app. Worst experience. Worst customer service. If food is not good, the delivery guys is not taking responsible and asked me to call customer service, when I call them, they give very less refund. Also, I hate the apps advertisement in YOUTUBE. It does not have skip option as well in YT. Suggesting everyone to COOK FOOD AT HOME AND EAT DURING THIS CORONA SITUATION AS NONE OF THE ZOMATO GUYS WEAR MASKS PROPERLY OR HANDS ARE CLEAN.",1
Worst service ever...its better to order in another alternative food service. In zomato if non refundable pay on food delivery...if suppose if call not not reachable twice...they wont call u multiple times..they will directly cancel the order or non refundable...even they dont deliver at doorstep or they dont check at delivery adress..just cancelled directly because there is no refundable.,1
The app is helpful and delivery was als good..but the food that we were expecting is not the same...The restaurant people have to be careful for the food that they are delivering ..after all its there duty to send good food once we paid the money..,4
its very bad experience. I ordered first time and it was very horrible experience. i did not get my order even after 2 hours. contacted to customer care and delivery guy but no solution provided till yet. its really very embrassing. i dont knw what was the issue but atleast you should contact regarding the issue. I am never going to order from Zomato bcoz i am feeling really very disappointing.,1
Zomato services have become poorer.. Never getting food on time. also promo codes or refund codes never working.. 1-2 years back it was a great app for me to order food.. but now a days they are not maintaining their quality.. also not giving proper chat option with their help centre in case of any trouble with order..,3
Worse experience ever the second time.. they charge me money and says your order is on the way and you have received it.. while I didnt receive my order and they reply back 1 day later!!! Saying ok will finally refund u!! I call them I send them massages from customer care and they completely ignore for 24 hours!! Go order from talabat or deliveroo atleast u will ensure ur food will arrive and u will get customer care in case of delay.,1
There time keeping is extraordinary,5
"the app did not auto pick the location and then it leads to order locarion at wrong place ,so i called the zomato for cancellation then they said they can't refund my money its unfair even the order was not prepared till i cancelled but still not any refund . quite disappointed from service. I need my money back !",1
Horrible experience with their customer service,1
my personal experience is about the quantity ordered through zomato as i dont want to comment about other portals. i feel quantity which is available by self pick up or at restaurant is more than what is delivered through zomato. technically speaking app is designed brilliantly.,3
"Uninstalling this app with lots of frustration. waited around 1 hour and then for no reason she cancelled the order when order was picked up and deelivery guy bike had issue. They can't deliver the food with some other guy. I have remain hungry and its happening quite frequently with ZOMATO. they are cancelling order for no good reason, tgey can't replace delivery guy or reorder . so much unprofessionalism",1
Horrible customer care experience. Placed an order through zomato which was not delivered in exact quantity or acceptable condition. After waiting and reporting the incident all zomato could do was adding a voucher... worst thing... you cant even talk to anyone at zomato since they dont have a call service...,2
I ordered food in which some items were missing on delivery. But didn't get full refund. The new AI (bot) chatting system sucks and is not at all useful. My experience was very bad. Instead use Swiggy or Uber eats.,1
This app is really super,5
"Worst service, whenever i am making an order, if incase the restaurant more than 3 km long then after preparing the food the delivery guys calling and telling they met with accident or bike got puncher so cancel the order, if this is happening one time we can understand,its unfortunately happened, but this is happening back to back , worst delivery peoples are working for zomato, and they are trying to fool the customers, they are making us wait for nothing for a long time, and leaving us hungry",1
Although services are great but lack of few things sometimes makes experience miserable like there should be option of product pics along with names so that one should have some idea while guessing fancy names. Also size or serving size ( in gms or ml) should also be mentioned in app. Some restaurents sell one third as compared to others while charge double. Agree for quality differences but Higher charges should be justified on basis ratings not on basis of names.,3
"I ordered food and the payment was already done through card. Did not receive any messages of food being delivered and no calls from the delivery assistant.. after waiting for almost one hour ,they did not deliver my food and a msg saying that we could not connect u and tired delivering. Inspite of giving the crrct address and location and they are saying my money of the food won't be  refunded..what is the mistake from my side for not delivering the food and not giving my money back?",1
"Very Very bad app. Please dont download it . I ordered food from this app . I received my order , but when i want to do next order it shows that you had cancelled your previous order and first pay penalty . I mailed zomato but they did not helped me . I request dont download it . It is a froad app",1
its overall good .. but zomato should also add a few fast food corners which are at the road side... also i sometime face some kind of server issue or something like that while using zomato app.. and they should also work on their delievery timings.. sometime they take near about an hour or more.. 😐😐,3
very bad app actually i orderd a pizza and went to take bath .I was alone at home and my mobile was charging and the time given for delivery was approx30-35 mins so i have thougt that the service man understood the addresses and when i come out of my bathroom i saw 2 missed calls and an email came that ur order for ..... restraunt is c ancelled due to not answering our calls and said me to order again and when i did so it took 115 rupees charge for cancellation. very bad app,1
"Pathetic customer support, i have ordered an item and just within a second i cancelled that order over the chat(as the only option provided by zomato), but the customer care representative gave response after 10 min. and told me that they can't cancel as it already gone into preparation.....within few second how can they prepared everything....and the response time is very slow...after sending every chat message, i had to hold on for 10 minutes to recive their response. Very Disappointed.",1
Worst Service .... Customer Service is even the worst .... 2 times my money was deducted and Order was not placed and when i contacted customer service they say they have understand my problem and will refund it in 24 hours and when again contacted them they say ...will refund it in 3 to 4 days ... its been 2 weeks my money is not refunded .... worst customer care service,1
Subz Tawa is to die for... thank you...,5
"I'm using this app for quite a long period. And it's food delivery service is great. But the main benefit i got when i joined zomato gold. It's offer best service when I feel for dining-out. Also, zomato gold has partnered with so much great restaurants and not only in particular region but all over the India. That's gave me as a customer to explore it's service when I am out of the town.",4
Very good service 👍,5
"Order wasn't even delivered but the status in the app says delivered. Placed the order at 12 and even after 4.15, it wasn't delivered. And delivery guy is making up some excuses and the customer service guys are repeating a script over and over again. Ridiculous.",1
Worst experience ever I had order at 1:50 by the time there was no problem after an hour of picking the order food was not delivered. Worst app wasting people's time... Finally they cancelled my order at 3:00 .They don't provide proper tools to the delivery boy .,1
"The app is good my complaint though is different. 90% of zomato Drivers do not follow traffic rules and violate all traffic rules & norms... risking their own lives and that of other citizens on the road. eg.. riding their bikes on the wrong side of the road into oncoming traffic, breaking traffic signal, riding on footpath , entering one way...etc please discipline your drivers, that their life is valuable , just like the lives of other citizens on the road.",5
There is no option for zero star other wise I will gave that.zomato do fraud with the customer the food quality quantity is so bad there is no option in chat to do complain if you select the option they show do mail to there support and after 48 hrs they reply we are sorry we will not do it again. But my money time everything got waist what I do with your sorry. ##don't buy from zomato buy from swiggy atleast they listen about your issue. #DON'T BUY FROM ZOMATO,1
"They just took the tip. Waited for 50 mins n order was cancelled saying some items werent available, that too at the last moment.Since its late , due to the waiting, there were no other restaurants too. zomato u need to look at these. D money wasnt refunded too. money wasn't refunded after d order was cancelled",1
"The rates for food items are high in zomato, same items are available in restaurants in comparatively lesser amount. Various promocodes are make available to the customers but even after discount,delivery charges and food item's price are so high that it costs the same, even extra many times.",1
"After experiencing all food delivery apps, zomato is the only app which remained on my phone, other just got uninstalled, that's the level of satisfaction I got through zomato, and I'm really enjoying it. Thanks zomato for providing such a good service and putting customer first and solving all issues relatedly,",5
Excellent food delivery app,5
very bad service. placed an order but the agent called and said that he cannot deliver to our location and asked us to cancel the order and done same as advice. they have charged on the account for the amount stating food is waisted. what a joke. pathetic service on chat as well no help and customer service at all.,1
Awesome 👍 on time delivery 🤠,5
"extremely unhappy the order was supposed to be delivered at 11 20, order is ready with restaurant, delivery boy's phone is not reachable his location is at same place where he was at the time of order delivery time is still 11 20, chat support expected wait time is 1 minute but it has been 20 minutes after my first message but no reply received, very pathetic, now after waking up i got surprise the app says your order is delivered i don't know where & still there chat support services shows 1min",1
worst app they even can't refund the money after cancelled and also can't give the food instead of refund.i thought they would refund half the the money but they didn't. worst app don't download it I even mailed them chatted with the agent they are so helpless I can even post the screen shot of chatting and I will prove u how helpless they are. wasted money wasted my time writing this worst ever review in my lifetime. I didn't even thought that they are such worst .1st time big review. not happ,1
We believe in Zomato and stand with kamraj Please guys support kamraj,5
After payment the delivery boy is not coming to location and app showing delivery boy will pick your in 30 minutes on time . .... But after countdown start it stop at 6 minutes ... After 10 minutes also it will be near 6 minutes .. waste Zomato they are tilling that they will deliver on time ... Please make sure ..😡,1
"superb offers, taste, but need somemore options like choosing our own combo and our choice of hotels, with more discounts without charging more than orginal price and again charging for taxes. like this overall we r not getting any discounts at all compare to real price we have there.",4
Excellent food delivery app,5
Everytime they r not following instructions,1
"zomato performance largely depends on the area you live...i live in vashi, navi mumbai...out here zomato is awesome...gives the cheapest prices and delivery is prompt af....however in high traffic areas of Mumbai delivery is naturally delayed which causes immense frustration...overall great app ...keep the discounts up!!",4
although experience sometime good and sometimes very bad firstly you have to remodify your website restaurant show some food without veg and nonveg sign how anyone can judge that and even you have to provide more information related to quantity In many restaurants there is only select option and not quantity options and if i ordered something i have to know the quantity of the product as it is sufficient for people.. if i order for 2 person and quantity was less.. i have to reorder or less eat,3
A very useful and must have app that I recommend to everyone. Did not run into any issues which is why I rate this app with a 5 star. The 50% off on the first order was a nice feature to the app.,5
Why the hell there is no option after making a payment for an order. There must be something to cancel the order. I just made an order without applying the promocode and the experience was horrible. What about my loss of money? Please refund me the same.,1
"this app has helped me through my starving phases and also zomato is better then swiggy is what i think no hidden charges and the food is fresh and good, one star less for packaging, swiggy does that well. all&all fresh and tasty food thats what matters so 4stars,happy with this app.",4
Recently I ordered food for my office party. The restaurant which i selected was 10 kms away from my location. So the delivery boy insisted me to cancel the order through helpline number. Now when i am ordering it showing me penalty of my earlier order of total bill. No bpdy helped me out from this situation. I didnt expected this kind of service from your side. Its your delivery boy who insisted me to do this. And you all want me to pay for this. This kind of issues are in making of bad name of your services.,1
it's worst experience from customer support. my amount was deducted but order was not placed. after sending many msg to customer support chat they didn't respond with single msg.. it's worst experience than any other app. there is no customer support for ur complaint.,1
"most pathetic experience with zomato.. had ordered today and without delivering the order, the delivery guy marked as delivered and after 1 hour calling me and saying that he cant find the address.. this is the way they provide guaranteed 35 min delivery ..their delivery person will mark.order as delivered without delivering..pathetic",1
Yeah it's really nice.. I came hyderabad for studying purpose but zomato washed out all my money. Thank you zomato for making me beaten by my dad.,5
Well i have 3 pending refunds from one months . They just make you pay and say the restaurant didn't accepted order . And i was told it will be refunded in 5 to 7 business days but its been a month . And if you try to reach the customer care exacative theyll make you wait for atleast half an hour . SBI employes are better then them .,1
"Horrible experience. Pathetic service. my food was not delivered at all. when I contacted them on chat, there was no response even after 20 minutes if wait and the chat was disconnected. Zomato customer experience is going down the drain.",1
Very convenient & quick processing of orders. Sometimes though delivery goes overtime & goof ups on orders (hence one star less) but on average the delivery is pretty quick. Lots of food choices for veg & non veg food & its a boon for office goers who want quick healthy meals. Deals make it pocket friendly as well. Keep up the good work.,4
The app sucks .. 👎 I tried chatting multiple times on their chat option but it necer get through. Had a word with their executives about the concern and they still don't care. Its like your ordering stuffs but you cannot complain if its not correctly delivered.,2
Worst order tracking app. Poor customer service. no phone support. only chat where agents dont pick up the chat for more than 30 minutes. while only option to call is the restaurant and the number mentioned is never answered.,1
"I have gold and they keep taking off dishes from gold. They have now started removing gold from particular dishes in the menu, not fair. Not going to subscribe to this again. They have removed combos, what a bad decision. Don't even deserve the one star rating. Highly disappointed.",1
"Issue Unresolved! Zomato has novice customer service associates who can't even help. They have templates to put in and try stay away from the customer's concern. Recently, I had placed an order at around 3 AM. The restuarant accepted, but it was cancelled moment later and it levied the cancellation chargea on my user account with a penalty of INR 400+ Zomato - Why such cruelty? I haven't done anything wrong with you or your family.",1
"had very bad experience. my order got more than 1hour late. and no one informed me about it. it was just showing ""food is being prepared"" for long time. and when i called restaurant they told me no one has arrived from Zomato to pick your food. so i started chat, but their response was also very slow same like their delivery. very bad app. don't go for it ever. just fools you around offers but zero professionalism.",1
"horrible experiences with every order. pathetic service in my location and time wastimg customer support. Also, They do not respond to the complaints over mail. False promises by customer support. inaccurate billings. leaky food delivery. some times they do not provide all items in the order. they apologise but never improve the services. I am fed up with your services now. I had complaint them on their mail but they have not replied.",1
"worst service. I ordered food and because my phone was not reachable the delivery man went back. And now the app shows me to pay for my order which they cancelled. I waited. I didn't get the food and they still expect me to pay for something i didn't receive. Literally, Zomato. You suck. Worst. Worst. Worst.",1
Warast delewari Not shutbul my food(210) rupees Singal pic ciken no masala plen raise biryani raise not presh day 2:30pm West and worst worst,1
Pathetic Services by Customer Representative and very bad app. Amount changes automatically and created dispute between restaurant and zomato. In between customer keeps on waiting for 1:45 minutes. Actually this app manages to get people attention by showing prices down prices drastically without consent of restaurant owner. Seriously man. I faced the inconvenience twice in consecutively placed 2orders. Customers need to beware of these management tricks.,1
Delivery partner is so rude and way of talk is so rough.,1
Very good service,3
Yesterday we made an order at 8:39 p.m and we didn't receive the order. At 9:56 p.m I tried to check the status of the order with no clear answer so I called the restaurant and cancel it . Plus they took the amount from our credit card :(,1
Great discounts and offers . Amazing for ordering food,5
wonderfull app to order food. It also takes additional instuctions which are very impressive..💛,5
"I have been ordering on Zomato for years. For past 4 times I see that Zomato is unable to track my location. Every time the delivery boy will come n stand in some other location and ask me to that location n pick up the package. The delivery boys r extremely rude n specially today's one. If this problem persists ,this is my last order through Zomato. I need an apology for this kind of behaviour!!",1
It's a great delivery app and it's food service is good .,5
"Everytime, either it is the delivery boy or the restraunt who has delivery issues. I always have to call customer service for an update. Even the chat service is not responsive enough. The worst part is that when you complain they add some money as charity like 38 RS in your zomato account. I don't know why they do fake promises and keep unprofessional people for delivery. Not happy with the service of Zomato this time. 😑",1
"Worst food delivery app when we want to cancel order due to some reason they don't do but they cancel after 50 min also with out bothering to inform Customer care is worse not have proper response cut the call in mid of conversation. Guys I recommend swiggy for their awsome service, packaging quality & excellent customer support..",1
Very Poor Delivery. If i call directly it tooks only maximum 15 minutes to get delivered. When I order through zomato it took 30 to 1 hour to get delivered. and some items in the menu of zomato is not available also in the restaurant. Horrible delivery and worst response from hotel if zomato order,1
"Pathetic service. I had placed an order and later the delivery guy said he called me, but i didnt get any calls and they cancelled the order even if i had approached the delivery guy. And they didn't even refund the money back. Very bad experience. Uninstalling the app right here.",1
Well I am zomato user since last 2 years. it's good for home delivery but if you found some issues with delivery or food and you complained the same you will get only nonsense reply like sorry for the inconvenience we will try to improve our services. such instance happened with m trice till date. Another request to all user plese don't buy any membership from zomato it's not worth they are providing offer on drinks and food which is not available at same place.,1
"Zomato does not have a customer support number it only have chat support which does not allows you to type anything rather you have to select options in the chat I ordered a cake for my sister's birthday and the cake I received was a spoiled one , it was such an embrassment to give her a cake like that and when I tried to report this issue they didn't provided me any options and gave a very vauge reply on mail saying sorry This is not how a company like zomato is expected to treat customers",1
"The swiggy service is more better than the zomato Zomato is not have call support if customer have any problem, there is only chat support and there is also not respond on time and they are not clarify our issues Zomato is cheats the customers Swiggy is more better in delivery, solving issues, support, and they have call support to solve the problems fast. Don't use zomato to order food, I suggest you guys use swiggy for better service",1
Recently Zomato are not giving any discount on restaurant as earlier they are offered. Now they are looking only on their own profits. Every dish price are increased as compared to respective hotel manu card. It's better to go to hotel and take parcel with reasonable price. Not recommended to any one.,2
"Utter worst app, i ordered something on zomato after paying via card, my money got deducted and i didnot even got order confirmation for that, it just mentioned unable to process payment (but my money got deducted) and they dont keep cash on delivery for most of the orders so that they can pull such cheap tricks.Please uninstall this app or else and install some other app or else one day you will be victim of such tricks.",1
Best app for food 👍👍,5
"Its a good app.. But they should let us write the reviews of the food that we ordered from the app. It only allows you to give the rating in stars like one star, 2 star... This type of rating system is doesn't let the user understand why low or high rating has been given",1
"Terrible! That's the perfect word! First of all your delivery is always late! Last day my delivery got canceled after 1.30 hours saying that the Delivery person is not available. And then, these people have blocked my account saying that there is suspicious behavior! Seriously? I didn't plan any terrorist attack using Zomato! Be kind to your customers guys! Worst service!",1
Worst interface. It wont even ask you to confirm the order. Payment gateway is also selected by default. And no option to cancel the orders. And worst customer service. They don't solve your issue.,1
Last version of this app was good but this version has so many glitchs.... Payment problems... Order gets cancelled because of payment issues but from my bank account the amount gets deducted and this happened thrice with me.... Even it take a long time to get you refund.... Plese look into this matter...,1
service is really good & fast... i just love this app we can easily place orders & compare restaurant So it's almost 2-3rd time that it doesn't update your order quickly I mean I got my parcel still it shows that my food is being prepared 😂😂😂I mean common man you should update your updates😂😂 Yaar mene 11:30am ko order kiya tha... Woh delivered bhi ho gaya abhi 1:46pm ho raha hein fir bhi your food is being prepared aa raha he😂😂😂 ab ye konsa food prepared kr rhe ho bhai???,2
Always on time. Soft spoken delivery guys and always fresh food.,5
I made my first order and it was not going on the payment page no matter how many times I tried .also the delivery time was too much then the others. in the end I was not able to order. also the overall layout is too confusing and it's creates a lot of confusion while placing an order,1
Everthing is fine. BUT MAIN LIMITATIONS IS IF ONE ORDER IS CANCELLED BY RESTAURANT ZOMATO DEACTIVE CASH ON DLIVERY FACILUTIES ! A CUSTOMER CAN NOT CANCEL THE ORDER BCZ THERE IS NO SUCH A OPTION TO CANCEL THE ORDER. INSTEAD OF FINE RESTAURSNT ZOMATO REVENGE ON CUSTOMER. SHAME ! SHAME !! SHAME ZOMATO !!! JUST BCZ OF THIS I DISLIKE ZOMATO's MANAGEMENT.,2
the food took 1hour to be delivered i dont think it needs 1hour to deliver food,5
Today I ordered pizza at 9:26pm and delivery time was 10:21pm. After the delivery time was over I pinged over Zomato chat and reported that i haven't received my order and restaurant is not picking up the phone. I was put on wait. after 10 minutes of waiting it showed me error. It means when I really needed the support from zomato's end it failed. It's 10:53 I still haven't received my order and there is no support from zomato.,2
Useless app..it can not accept my default address..& delivery some another address...it always doing mistake but it have so much excuses..doesn't provide me COD..,1
Very good service,5
"One of the most 3rd class Food delivery app in the city,Almost like 2 weeks back i ordered food from one of there restaurant,After few moments later they cancelled my ordered as they do not have the menu without any notice,Meanwhile my whole amount got dededucted which they promised me to refund back within 4-5 days,But unfourtunetly after 2 weeks of span i did't get my money back,Still there useless chat execitives pretend like they don't know about this,Please use Uber eats or Swiggy instead.",1
"I used to love this app but with time they have showed their real color. Mailed at their website ,got no reply. Discussed my issue on chat , Didn't support my words instead accused me for wrong even i have proof and recordings of the phone calls. A Big disappointment",1
"very bad experience, he is take order, but note give proper and satisfied response. his take order but not responsible for their order and order money also. there service is pathetic, im do order today also with Zomato, and there partner will delivered parcel but they are not in good condition, but Zomato's no one person are touch with me. pathetic service and Froude company...",1
Very bad service !! Disappointed!! I ordered dominos Pizza through this app. After 20-30 mins it started showing that order has delivered. Tried to ask for refund but zomato took no responsibility and clearly denied for order as well as refund. Very bad experience!,1
Very good service,5
"So fast , now let's try the food",5
"Very bad experience. Before some time it's very good but now they people doing very bad. In app, they was showing different quality of food and when it's come at home the food is different. This is very bad thing. Please don't do this. We don't want a big discount but we want this quality in food.",2
the app doesnt allow to cancel any order if placed by mistake! ut doesnt even allow to modify the order or the payment process!! the customer care is not very responsive and helpful!! And to top it all nobody nor even the delivery guy knows the process!,1
Food was not prepared till i reached after the recommended time.When i ask for my food after the waiting time resturant staff said cancel the order we cannot provide you for further 10 mins than I tried to cancel the order as i was unable to cancel my order as no option available (Order was accepted by Resturant) Food was provided without seal package again i have to accept it no option to cancel tasteless food and by the time i reached my home all food spoiled in poly bag..,1
"They're service team will give you the best awful experience you can get anywhere in the corporate world ! I don't know about the services out of India but here it definitely sucks, false advertising is a huge problem with this app! I think to call the restaurant and place the order is best instead going through these guys and trust me guys this not based on one experience but many!",1
what a service by Zomato. seriously I'm Loving it. Chat Service is lit.They reply so quickly. I complained about my food packaging related issue. They solved my problem in few seconds. Even Delivery guys from Zomato are so humble and Nice. offers are also Nice. seriously This Is So amazing. Thanks Zomato for Giving us a great service. You r love.❤️,5
"very good app. started as an excellent, classy service to find good restaurants. has been my go to for looking up eating places, reviews, bookings, etc. the Gold program is quite good. but disappointed with the delivery side of the biz - they dont show you the address of the place, sneak in packing/ delivery charges on the last screen and physical delivery is limited & late.",4
I really appreciate your service also happy for giving many people a living by engaging them. Great job 👏 👍 👌,5
I was a big fan of FoodPanda but switched to Zomato because of good delivery experience and because some of my favorite but small restaurants are covered only by Zomato. They probably have most restaurants covered among all apps. Only issues are missing estimated time of delivery after placing the order and live tracking does not work sometimes.,4
Service is good,5
"Amazing app, especially for a home-alone teen, it's so useful!",5
very bad experience.. I ordered something by mistake. and I called to shopkeeper as well as that delivery boy but they didn't cancelled my order and have to pay for what I didn't received. chat zomato option is worse it's not work at all. and earlier what ever I ordered that was so bad in taste as compared to what we ate there,1
"Amazing, I've never had a problem in ordering food from Zomato. Whenever there has been any quality issue they have made sure they refund or compensate.. I would like to thank you for trusting your customers and making sure they are always happy.",5
"Just now I went to order in domino's through zomato. Guess what!! The usual drama of payment failure. After the debited SMS I got, app page says ""parameters missing"". So pathetic that this app is so volatile!!!!! 😡 SMS clearly says that zomato media received payment of 419. Yet that info is reflected. They are not even responding properly. You know what the time is??? 9:45pm. Uffffffffff...... I am hungry fishes!!!! 😭😭😭😭😭😡",1
"customer service personnel could have been more helpful. Payment is often problematic, as it often shows failed payment even after money has been deducted from bank. Service charge and delivery charges are huge, and surge charges are added every day.",1
"Good enough app..have been using it for a while now. There was a minor issue with a particular delivery, made a complaint through the app and issue was resolved with complimentary points.",4
"Have had pretty bad experiences a few times.. part of the order has been missing, and there is no solution that is provided by the concerned people. Inspite of the fact, that they promise to get back within 24-48 hours.. it just doesn't happen.",1
"They can cancel order after 40 min of wait and say sorry, just because they have not been able to deliver on time which would have costed them. There is no remorse or regret that someone is starving. Uninstalling this app and switching to another.",1
not happy at all. cancellation of order process is not at all good. after placing my order i called delivery agent after 45 minutes about the order. he told making the order will take extra 1 hr. he advised me to cancel the order. accordingly i cancelled it. they cahrged me entire order amount as cancellation fees. while placing order delivery time shown 30 to 45 minutes. i cant understand how can they charge order amount if order is not fulfilled on time. i am leaving this app. this is pathetic,1
"This app is good in every aspect, from offers to service. This app is my go to for ordering food, also i order from this app like daily. The only reason i gave 3 star is because this app shares my phone number with the delivery guy, after making the delivery 99% of the time the guy either calls back asking 5 star rating or spams messages for 5 star rating, that is really annoying. Hope that they implement some feature like Uber eats for calls since they recently acquired it.",3
Worst food app ever! They never deliver on time their delivery executive are rude and unprofessional. Chat support doesn't work and if you have a concern you would get a revert days after the incident. Had a pathetic experience would not recommend it to anyone.,1
"Even after applying the promo code, the order was confirmed without discount. So I had to pay more because they're sorry but they can't do anything. Swiggy is a much better app for ordering food online. Atleast they actually help us",1
No option for order cancelled.. Pathetic customer service as they take at least 10 minutes to respond on your queries and will not entertain your queries.. App has some issues as it doesn't give confirmation of your order.. I will uninstall it and will not recommend it as these guys are just looting people...,1
"Had a great experience till date but a small glitch which need to be fixed, seen it multiple times, the delivery person is at my door step and in the app it still shows moving around somewhere.... A 5 star coming once this bug is fixed...",4
From last update whenever I try to apply any coupone it pop's up error checking payment status kindly rectify the issue. For gold order also same issue when unlock gold Update Have sent mail and it's one month haven't received any update or reply also had word with social media team on twitter they said will reply you but haven't heard from there as well. This is the last time I have bought gold. Swiggy is far more efficient in providing services.,1
"This zomato won't give cash on delivery option where people in home not able to pay online,so this is not preferred.no problem with swiggy it always feel customer friendly .offers are also only through online in zomato. But most times swiggy won't do like this.from almost one and half year I am using swiggy,I habituated ordering food because of zomato up to they provided cash on delivery,after I shifted to swiggy for my convinience of cash on delivery.",1
"I use this app last one year but that time I am very disappointed you suddenly change your policies I order some food and have already paid customer care cancel my order after one and half an hour my payment also not return back reason is delivered person is call me only one time try again call back 4,5 times is not receive the call is not up to the mark😡😡😡 today 11/10/1991 again same problem I sending a mail consumer court second time will be happen same thing is not matter for money 😡😡😡",1
they use chat bot for customer support which is of no use as their response is pretty standard and also they do not have any phone call based customer support. so you order at your risk. I have observed that their services have not improved over the months...they a simply regret about their mistakes that's all...,1
"worst experience in my last 3 orders. after chatting with customer service they will give credits doesn't give proper solution.in first order there is items missings, 2nd order roti is not there in meal, 3rd order they didn't apply credit to the order. i have full recording of order booking. worst app ever.",1
Useless app. They charged and did not deliver exact quantity. Deliverred after 50 minutes that to less quantity. Asked me to take partial refund. Shall I reorder with partial refund and reorder and wait for another 40 minutes. Useless support and app.,1
Offers good discount(which is decreasing slowly) and good customer service too. I would give it 5 star if it added a feature to add restuarant to a favourite list and to blacklist some other restaurants. Would help a lot in ordering process.,4
Please make your delivery guys aware of local area or land mark. Always they are finding difficult to reach us as your app is not showing the exact location. Please include pozhichalur kidzee preschool in your land marks. Delivery guys are not seeing the address given and shouting at the costumers by saying we are not here to read your address. Please train them with their behaviour. And this is the 3rd time the package was torn badly and spills out.,1
"When ever I place my odder through this app it always gets cancelled and my money always gets debited from my account and when I raised my complain to their employees they behave in a rude manner. Nither they take any action nor they listen to the problems faced by there customers. If we compaire this app and swigge, swigge is much more better than this app at least they listen to the needs of their customers if we face any problems during our odder they immediately takes the follow up.",1
"Had a wonderful experience using zomato. l liked the feature of live food tracking also the delivery is also done efficiently. The promo codes helps in reducing cost which will not happen in case you directly visit the restaurant. Just order food , wait for probably 20-30 min and then booom....food is ready in doorsteps.",5
"i can add new delivery location/address but can not delete old saved divery location/address. while adding new address use current location not locating accurately the current location, selecting somewhere near by location which makes delivery boys to call many times to find exact address.",4
"The best! you can literally juz sit back and relax and can order anything that you are craving for!! this is so amazing!! no need to worry about the travelling hazzle, if u want that specific food from your special restaurent which is miles away. These guys takes care of it all!!!",5
"There should be an option for us to write in the chat ,to explain our problem and not select from your useless options, just like in case of my recent order from wow momos there were payments defected twice from two cards as for one card payment got deducted even after transaction got declined. But there is no option on the chat to convey this issue.",1
useless app.Inconvenient for users.They take orders but not responsibility of delivering on time.No follow up.Don't have option to cancel order if you are not receiving.I placed order on dominos twice my order didn't received and neither cancelled .No refund my money wasted.I did conversation with chat support.But they said they don't have option to cancel.Such useless service and app it is.Not even valet number they had.,1
"I have been the regular customer of Zomato as of now, but due to the technical glitches in their system for identifying the location, my order got cancelled and i was asked to pay the charges. The valet was not really cooperative and asked me to pay his money instead. I would rather love to switch to swiggy app now. Extremely bad experience with the Zomato, would not recommend it to anyone else.",1
"Customer service is really bad at Zomato. UberEats was far better in that . Many times they just said Sorry n no refund for the order . N sometimes when they refund , they give it as a coupon.. which ultimately a customer loss only . Already they have high prices n delivery charges. That's why they give coupon to make people fool. But if u use refunded coupon , ultimately that is our loss only. Not going good Zomato .",2
"worst app ever..unlike other app,the zomato agents doesn't help to solve ur problems.if in some situation the delivery boy fail to find ur address and due to some network errors if u fail to contact the delivery boy,ur order will be cancelled without knowing ur consent & the zomato agent will blame u responsible for this instead of solving ur problems & they will never refund ur money....very bad services of zomato agents.i have experienced this situation today.",1
"After the delivery of the order, the rating screen for food and delivery person is opened, if we close the app or forget to rate, the rating screen disappears and there's no option to rate it afterwards in my orders. Ratings should be availble in my orders or the rating screen should not close, one cannot rate the food without tasting the food. Thats what you are making us to, either rate immediately after delivery or never. Please add rating options in my orders.",4
"Good, faster delivery",4
"Zomato service is getting horrible day by day... BE VERY CAUTIOUS WHEN ORDERING AT LATE NIGHT.. Zomato has employed 100% non-efficient staff in delivery and in their chat support. The delivery guys just fool around with the orders and report it to Zomato complaining about in correct location; however, Zomato has been sending orders at same location for more than a year regularly.. Then they without any information to customer cancels tye orders and update the customer account with REJECTED statu",1
The app performance is pathetic. On weekends it is the worse and you are never able to place an order. Why advertise for all the doacounts when people cannot place order on your app. Finally had to place the order using swiggy. If you cant make your app performance better then its your loss.,1
Zomato's service is so bad.. it's not delivering to our address whenever we place order it alwasys says that restaurant has gone offline even though its online.. and so many restaurant are not available now to order.. uber eats was much better than zomato. Even though they have collaborated but the restaurant that we used to order with is not available yo our address 👿👿,5
"I have been using zomato for last 2 months. Got best results. Best prices. But one thing is to be improved , when you are searching for Add button to place the order, you need to go first for food order online button. When someone is using app that would be for online food only, I think new users might get confused while ordering.. Need to fix it. Thank you.",4
"Not proper, if does any mistake from there side, they don't accept the fault and also doesn't deliver the food and will forfeit the whole amount paid by online transaction. Many times I have faced this problem, its a very common problem and will leave you hungry in nowhere condition. Never trust",1
Did not receive order or refund for same,1
"I hated their service. They message very often saying there is some offer and whenever we place any offer they say that the restaurant no longer provide services. What the hell, their app doesn't even understand 'what went wrong'!!!hated it.",1
Worst app and service. Delivered wrong food. And when reported without opening the food tjey did not take the food back not refunding the money . They agreed on partial refund helplessly i agreed but still no refund provided Also wrote email to order.Zomato...really frustrating an annoying. Dont waste ir time and money... 🙏🙏,1
There is no way to call service centre and the chat system never responds on time. I paid online for my food order the money got deducted but the restaurant was not accepting order there was no action taken from zomato. And after all this I was unable to contact them. Really bad service,1
"Always order with ""cash on delivery"" option. Prepaid options might be cancelled without any refund and you'll lose your money. They do not consider the address you've entered as the right address but some pinned location that they decide on their own.",1
"Hi ZOMATO, I ordered the food from zomato app and i updated the delivery address in address column but after confirmed the order it took the previous add which was earlier updated and after that there was no option to update or change the order., even i dropped the message on chat to chnage the address bt nt chng So i thought to cancel the order and ater that i can book to that address but after cancel the order i got message from zomato that money can't be refunded and also food cant delivered",1
"The worst app and the worst custmr care ever u have to be through.I had an order placed in wrong address,when i asked the cust care if he could help in changing the add,he agreed,thn in the live tracking i could see the delivery boy not even nearby my wrong address,he nt only denied to deliver bt also zomato did nt return any amount as i had paid during placing the order(whereas they called and confirmed me a refund). As they dont have any cust care to call,they stay irresponsible.No Change at al",1
Excellent food delivery app,5
"This app and the zomato executives are really being sick. They have received the payment but the order was not placed due to some reason stated by them and they told me that I will be getting a refund. All this happened on Friday and now it's monday and they started denying the refund process. These guys are really fraud and eat your money, I suggest never to order with them.",1
"It's a honest review , please do not use this app for ordering your food because their system is not well developed to handle your order properly I've just ordered food from a nearby outlet and it got redirected to some other outlet and their refund policy takes 5-7 business days and when I spoke to their chat person all they could do for me was an apology",1
"my experience is very nice with zomato delivery service it's amazing we feel like so light in house with zomato delivery , it saves our fuel, our purchased boundation . it saves our money also. kids also can order easily with zomato app. it's delivery is very fast rather than restaurant's directs delivery. we recicived our order in 15 to 20 minutes. today we also recicived our order in just 15min. it's really amazing. thanks zomato and it's team. my children also likes to give order",5
"i had made an order nd i have faced the worst experience buying food thru zomato. my order was ready at the restaurant but since zomato coudn't assign any valet, i had to sleep hungry. support section is useless and one had to wait for about half an hour before an executive is assigned for the chat and then he will not be able to find a solution. p.s. why don't you guys limit ur operations to a small area when u r not able to handle orders nd queries or better shut down coz its not ur cup of tea",1
"No help from support for a order. They asked me to write email which is not at all feasible. I was hungry and the food was pathetic from the resturant which i ordered. What do think, people should write email and get there issues resolved instead of a chat or a call. Worst service. Please work on this.",1
"They do not have an executive to chat when you have any order unlike other delivery apps. the chat to us you are chatting to a computer who cannot solve the problems.they take the order and payment and then when u want to know the status they say the restaurant is foing self delivery, then i could have given order to the restaurant directly",1
"Customer service is abysmal.Nobody tries to help genuinely,everytime the wait time is above 5.I ordered food at 8:30 and it has to be delivered at 9:05 and when i checked my phone at 9:05,i got a notification that your order cannot be fulfilled by the restraunt and my money got deducted.When i tried to reach customer support due to the high waiting time my query got acknowledge at 9:50 and after that they gave randon unusual type of explanation as to why my money can't be refunded.not satisfied",1
"My friend has ordered today and he didn't apply the promo code so thought to cancel the order in a hurry. We had to answer some questions and mistakenly clicked on confirm button to cancel the order. The question was "" You won't get refunded, are you sure to cancel your order?"" I mean that's so dumb. Why would anyone let go of his money when cancelling an order? Such a big startup but lack of some common sense.",1
Previously the app was very good.But now it was totally bad.Instead of delivering food they want me to pay for the food because of the distance issue.Where as the address is same where they delivered the food for the past several months..But now by raising the distance issue they want me to pay for the food which I have ordered but they don't deliver and I don't receive..,1
Not able to contact their executive the chat process is very frustrating. Lost almost 5k on orders. They say the money would reverse back into the account after a disappointing delivery or wrong delivery but that never happens. Uber eats is way better than this...,1
Earlier i used to rate this app 5 stars but day by day their services are getting down. Once i ordered food at night but their valet was not well groomed he was talking rudely and was not willing to find our place.when we called him he was not picking call. The customer care executive was also not helping.he was just saying that your order will be cancelled and no refund will you get.when i chat at customer support they said to mail the complaint. Its going to be about one week no reply i got.,1
"Its too costly if you order from zomato. Changes for delivery are very high. Suggest you insted of placing order from the app please do collect from restaurant only. If you calculate your petrol bill, time etc still you are in winner. This app mostly for making money instead of providing service in low cost.",1
services and available list of restaurants are good. on time service. Well trained staff of delivery boys. Zomato deseves the five star rating for such services. Zomato still improving their services for betterment of the customers. I recommend Zomato for everyone for anytime anything food services on door facilities. Thanks Zomato for giving such easy food options in our door step. My best wishes....!!!,5
totally pathetic service. Their every order is delayed by half an hour atleast. always shows 45 mins to get the food delivered but never on time. Going to uninstall this useless app now. Have to give one star forcefully as it is necessary to post any review otherwise they don't deserve for any star.,1
this is 3rd class app. i have ordered food and then due to some reason i have cancelled my order instantly. after 5 min the notification will came on my phone that your food is on way. then i call to dielevery boy and he said that order is not cancelled and when i ordered next time they included privious order amount. so this thing i don't like it.,1
Worst app to order food from it never order anything when they say something on discount because they will send all the leftover food which sticks and when you complaint about this on customer support they we say sir consider this time as an exception..and this is not the first time happened with me they always do the same. This is a fraud company swiggy is far better than zomato,1
I've submitted the request to revert my order money as the food packaging was not done properly and there was complete spillage of the food. It's been more than three days and didn't got any response from the team. Very poor customer service. Don't order food from here.,1
"Definitely works very well in most ways, 4 because, the typography you guys picked to match don't match at all, painful to the eyes to look at the UI. Let the elements in the screen breathe, more spacing more margins, and fewer tabs. Too over crowded",4
"I had q very bad experiences with zomato I seriously didn't want to give even one star. It was one Saturday I was in my office, usually on Saturdays our canteen will be closed so I ordered food from zomato and was looking at the app to track the person after one hour of me waiting for food. I got a call from zomato customer service tell that the order is cancelled because my phone was not reachable and they are not ready to refund my money was very rude.",1
Zomato has become so much irritating. I dont know what fun they get from delivering wrong items to customer. Service is horrible . And when we raise a complaint we are asked to write an email. So much chaos just to get correct food item 🤦‍♂️. Aftet writing the email they reply in 5 days that too with an apology and no solution. It sucks. 👎 Zomato,1
People who buy food from this app can clearly considered as mountain sheep.... the food here is unhygienic they will always send left over foods and will charge double for that.. People are just buying these left over food for double rate thinking that coupons had provided them discount ...I have personally wnet checked the food quality that I get if I go and buy at that particular restaurant and the food I get if order through Zomato...and customer service is worst than any other.,1
i like this apps simplicity and the dedication of the management in keeping the customers happy. they trust the customer's words when it comes for feedback. i totally recommend them for food delivery to your homes and kindly wish them the best!,5
Very bad delivery service,1
"First 5 orders @ 50% discount but never got any at this discounted price, that too only 3 orders i utilised the promo then it showed invalid. Another hidden charge is the tax part, which are being charged at >=40% or 50% instead of 18%. Cheating by giving discount promos and then reducing or adjusting it with the tax amount which was earlier charged at higher rate.",1
Most of the time I received my order incomplete or mishandled. Moreover the behaviour of the delivery guy is too rude. Not acceptable at all.,1
"This app doesn't care about customer experience and review. Costumers voices are never heard. They promised me a refund for the order that did not get delivered but I did not get my money back,even after contacting them repeatedly. Bad experience.",2
Zomato has started to ignore it's customers now. There is no proper customer support help available on-time.Today I ordered food and made the online payment. But I didn't receive my order but in the app they marked as food delivered. After nearly 2 hours of hustle they decided to refund my amount.This app is such a waste of time.,1
"The worst customer service amongst all the food delivery apps. Ordered an ice cream with waffle, the ice cream was a puddle of brown liquid and the waffle was missing. Contacted support only to be disappointed, wasted so much of my time. Told me to contact their email support for resolution, have sent 2 emails till now and they haven't bothered to reapond its been 3+ days. Worst customer service ever.",1
"Zomato customer care service is too bad. They have only chat service and that too they respond very late when we contact for food related issues. I've faced issues twice and in those two scenarios they apologized and said it will never occur again, but ot happened again and again. I'm sure we don't get proper response on time if we complain at emergency situations like fallen sick due to food poison..",1
Very best in food ordering. A good list of restaurants to choose from and most importantly the UI is very user friendly. The customer service is alo very good. Never disappointed with Zomato and I have been using this since last 3 years.,5
"Customer service used to be very helpful, now idk what happened but the agents are VERY bad and they take forever to respond and they respond with irresponsible and irrelevant answers. And they just copy paste ""thank you for your patience please bear with us"" SUCH A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT IN AN APPLICATION I USED TO ADMIRE!",1
I have to edit my review 5 to 1 Whenever I order some time it delayed and some time items got delivered it with very bad condition and when I order they deliver the food after 90 min which the aggreed to order while placing with in 30 min when I call and ask then they said it is multi order your order is in my bag but will deliver after I get another one so wait. When I escalate this to there executive they always said please mark as a exception case will not happen again then again they do same,1
I want to request you to please do not use this app all froud. Start up was good now they popular. Now customer service and support now available. This is third time now. 1 delivery late. 2 wrong food delivery. 3 not delivered the order & delivery boy rough behaviour. Cust support option now open the window to rise the query. Swiggy customer response team is much batter then you.,1
"Easy way to order foods and receiving it on time. It is helpful for old age people who can't walk to restaurant amd kids under 3 yrs who ll not cooperate to enjoy the dine. So its best way to bring the joy at home. We can also order for people who is unwell, that's good.Thanks Zomato.",5
"Quantity has now become a big concern for zomato.There partner will delivered a food which is not sufficient for single perso. Sometimes quality is also a big issue. i guess they need to serve properly. And complaints are always answer by tha ""we have shared stern feedback"" which doesn't make sense.Zomato lossing the value.",2
They dont check the if all the ordered items are present in the delivery but charge the same amount. Disappointed with the valet's service as well as the descripensies in the app to report these things. Their support system or help is quiet useless.,2
"Guys trust worst customer support and services is only given by this app. Guys request all better go with swiggy and uber eats. Or still if someone prefers to order this app cross check order coz there delivery guys take extra amount and give you. Different order. There is direct customer care support and o. Chat also, there are bots only. Month back committed my refund. Till date I didn't got. After payment if anyone really want to stay hungry please use this app.",1
"My order was cancelled and whole amount was deducted, i kept waiting for the food but later i got to know that i was not available at my address that is too when i was the one who was making call to their delivery boy. What an excuse, i had given prepaid order from my card but from next time i will order cash on delivery. Please understand and trust your customer instead of you computerized customer support which replies as per your pre defined situations.",1
"An awesome application to order food online. Sometimes, they also cause problems but they take care of the complains which I really liked. Apart from that good collection of restaurants from mediocre level to hi fi. Good job Zomato and hope to see some great level of enhancements to meet customer satisfaction.",4
"This app has recruited so screwed men. First off, they don't see the address and keep calling again and again. The order is always delayed and there is no cancellation option. I trusted zomato but it didn't meet my expectations. Never ever on time",1
"It provides bad service, the food packing was open also the quantity of food was less with compared with previous same food order.After raising complaint with the customer care they said for inconvenience they can add 24 credit and will raise the complaint ahead but they have not taken any action for this issue....very bad experience",1
pathetic customer support service no reply comes on time the chat support is really bad well I was asking something and the reply was something different strange kind of customer support system don't know if it was computer generated reply or a person replying for sure computers can't be so dumb ! and yes I wish I had the option to share the screen shots of the chat here.,1
Too poor delivry service,1
This app is good. But few of the zomato valets are rude and does not deliver the food in time. They delay in picking up the order too. So overall I would like to give 5 out of 10 for this app and their services.,2
awesome service.. but need some changes to be done. as amount should be deducted after the order confirmation from the restaurants side. because some things they dont have the food which we order or they cant supply. so pls. make this changes .,4
Very good service,5
on delivery tab above the restaurant details it show 40% discount use code: zoamto but when i apply that code it show it not valid for this restaurant..but happen all restaurants which is provided 40% discount...i have compiled many times but no results will be come.... very bugy app..and ..also not supportive customer care,1
"Pathetic app. Pathetic zomato support. I ordered one cake for my bro. Cake not got delivered but status updated as delivered. Since two days m trying to reach zomato. In support chat they have bot system who keeps asking same question again and again. But no response. Emailed multiple times, received system generated same email. Hate zomato. They just make customer frustrated",1
Initially it started with beautiful sceneries and then the colors started fading away ending up in a disaster. That's how I would describe zomato service. The quality is dropping every day.,2
"It was a good app for ordering food but now they have removed d option of type when talking to customer service it turns out to be a ridiculous nd highly irritatng food ordering app,it seems like d app owners r hardly concerned for providing any customer service in case there occurs any problm in d order which now a days is pretty common,I have ordered chocolava nd consistently from last 4 times d packing is poor due 2 which there is a leak of food nd then there is no customer care to talk to.",2
"It's one of the most worst app for ordering online food.Neither they have proper customer care service with them,they also made false claim of delivering fast .They don't even deliver the food and not even your money which u have paid in advance to them.Then.they will cancel your order by making false claim against you. By the way it doesn't deserve a 🌟 rating at all Really disappointed by the app and it's services which is worst compare to other apps,users may try some other app than this.",1
WORST SERVICES..I heard very good thing about your app..but when I order a pizza it was worst experience. My order has Ben confirm n hand over to delivery boy but they did not delivered after 45 mints ..tooo bad service and very rude talk by delivering boy on the phone....must improve your service...thank you very much for wasting my 45 mints.. no response yet,1
"one of the most disguting customer support I have experienced ever. they will take ages to respond to your chats no matter how urgent the issue might be. pls go for swiggy instead. offers , customer service...its better in both aspects.food delivery time might be lesser than chat response time.",5
useless app.... I wanted to raise a complaint...but the zomato chat never reply... everytime I explain my issue after every 20 minutes new guy appears... after that somehow I managed to get customer care number after too much struggle they never ever pick up the phone.... swiggy is far better than this😠😠😠,2
Good service. Didn't give 5* because I think there is place for an improvement. Photos of every food item along with its dimension and weight should also be published like all the online shopping websites do. It helps a lot. You can not predict what's inside when you only know the name of a food item. Their names are always peculiar.,4
the delivery system is so slow and i relied on the order waited for more than one and a half hour and the restraunter says it is not their problem as there is no delivery boy to pick the food and asked us to contact zomato. zomato doesn't provide phone number on the app which is so inconvenient to inquire. worst experience!,1
Location is based on the center of the town instead of your actual location so all distances are based on that instead of where you are.,2
"Really disappointed that you guys Uber Eats merged with you guys. UE gave so many options and discounts. Restaurants from where I used to order previously are now showing ""doesn't deliver here"". Also, the prices are so high compared to what ubereats used to offer. Really really disappointed that I'm being forced to use this app.",1
"While promoting heavily on 50% OFF ,one should ensure not to fool customers with inflated food prices. checked the prices for same food and same reataurant at the same time from Swiggy, Zomato and Foodpanda and even after applying TASTY code , the cheapest was Swiggy with Rs.50 off on Phonepe payment. While the app is great and very easy to use and is my top choice for reviews. such experience hampers the trust",4
Existing Uber eats customer. Not satisfied with the Zomato app. 1. Not easy to find required restaurants or menu easily 2. Lot of extra information which is not needed to customer 3. Few Uber eats vendors are discontinued and not seen in Zomato 4. Cost of each item is more 5. Delivery time is always late than the one projected during order,2
pathetic delivery service from zomato... i selceted a restaurent with less wait time 20-30 mins as i was hungry. But ended up waiting for 2hours for my order. Worst part is chat support guys will never respond. Zomato really need to understand and dont fool people with the wait time. worst experience ever. Time for changing to swiggy.,1
the delivery executs didn't have the change regularly and they are so manner less. till now I have 45+ orders and in each order they would not return change of 5-10 rupees so 45 x 5 = 225 so where are my 225 rupees😡 even some time they would not return 20-30 rupees and they would say that If some day I would again deliver your order then I will return your change.or they would go without giving my change. and sometimes they also deliver wrong item. I know I can chat also but how many times😠,1
Make sure you give proper support assistant for your customers. upgrade your bot system or your support assistant. Waited for food more than a hour and cancelled by support team asked me to order again. Stupidity! I would have given nagetive stars if i had option.,1
Customer service is very very very bad. many items are missing in my order but ZOMATO didn't help. even customer care person didn't help any thing and found unwanted thing also in my food. insects like that. I don't know how they maintain food quality. Better I prefer swiggy or food panda. Now many options are there. Box meal etc...,1
They are horrible. I ordered for a cake and the cake was not yet delivered but it was shown that it has already been delivered in its location but the cake was never received by me at the given location. I also paid the full amount of money I did not even get any refund and when I did a chat with them they are not even responding the questions.,1
"Pathetic service. I changed my number and later updated my profile with that number. There App is so pathetic that they didn't update the number and later cancelled my order after payment. The person sitting there was useless, no refund just kind words. i paid money for food not for your kind words.",1
I placed an order and paid online.my order never came. After getting notified that my order is on the way i also could not track order and kept waiting.But the zomato valet's phone was not reachable.In the support section i explained all the situation but did not get any rply and they did not say anything about REFUND. Such a FRAUD app zomato is.,1
pathetic these application are not worthy of our time the customer support will.make you cry and not respond . there is no guarantee you have ordered the right food and customer will be taken care of. they tild me that there is no cancellation charges but they deducted yhe entire amount and have no sense of customer service they have gonw crazy insane,1
The worst delivery system... The delivery boys always do misbehave...this app gives too much offers to get clients attention... But during delivery shows the real colour.... This app always take wrong location and for this I have to cancel my order 2 times and I also have lost the money.,1
Very good service,5
"What to say. This is the best online food delievery app. From all nearby big resturants to the budget ones get all at one place, moreover at discounted price. Love saving money by using zomato and having delicious meals timely with home-delievery option. So happy with the service. Keep it up..... Zomato🌟",5
"Zomato has an exhaustive list of restaurants and the reviews are good. However, the in app discovery and navigation is bad. There's a feeling of information overload while using this app. This app really suffers from preferring form over function. Needs to be redesigned to reduce clutter.",2
"😐 Food quality was not so good as I hv ordered last time, may be should have tried from other restaurants. Delivery could have been done little earlier.over all experience was not as good as I hv expected. Never mind app and its features are good.",3
"Delivery Charges are too high for this App. Not happy and satisfied with this App. Also facing late delivery all the time with repeated popups for ""ZOMATO GOLD"". Also ""LIVE TRACKING"" feature is not at all reliable. LATE DELIVERY AND HIGH DELIVERY CHARGES.",1
swiggy is far better.first time order was good i didn't face any problem but second time it was very pathetic it took almost 1 hr for delivery and also the delivery boy was very confused about the route.zomatoes location service is pathetic.when i use it it says my place name as something else.i will never complain delivery boy it was zomatoes mistake.i use current location in maps and it automatically generated the place name.but that doesn't match with real name of place ..,2
This app only shows restaurants near you. Most difficult to check on other or specific restaurant elsewhere. I was looking for a restaurant in the Hotel Metropolitan in Delhi and it always came up with useless information. Finally by going to Google and then opening the Zomato link I could get the information with great difficulty,2
"Worst service, order never comes on time, bad experience several time. meal cost is also high than actal meal price in the hotel. Also there are several charges we have to pay apart from meal we ordered. like delivery charges, packaging charges, tax etc",1
I am extremely disappointed with their services. First they have no control over the restaurant regarding the quality of food and service offered. Secondly their delivery guy need to be more responsible with their duty as I have noticed that in Navi Mumbai area they don't deliver at door step plus u get the message that food has been delivered before u get the order in hand.,1
"The app itself is not bad. The Zomato customer service people are unfortunately bad at serving customers. If a restaurant tells you they'll have an order to you in 45 minutes, don't expect Zomato to have your back when 2 hours later, the food hasn't arrived. Their customer service chatter boxes are full of excuses. Oh. And shall we not start on Zomato Gold? Scam.",3
"I ordered very first time yesterday night & paid through debit card, in against it I got a message about delivery boy is on the way & you can call him to know the real time of your order & status n all....but after 28 min I got a message again that night king restaurant is not operating now.....after 10:30 PM I started to cook my food & then slept on 12 am...so it was my worst experience with zomato..zomato advertises own about 30 min of delivery otherwise full money return but after 28 min they",1
Easy to navigate and does what its intended to do without a glitch. Like the review option which informs one of others experience with a particular outlet A bit concerned about the security of banking details and how robust the platform security protocols are but then again it's the same for all online transactions. I haven't use the app outside my country of residence but will be interested to see if and how big its international footprint is considering I've deleted all other food apps,4
"Zomato was the go to app for getting food delivered to your comfort-until now. Getting an order from KFC seems like such a mountain of work for them. It's been an hour and a half since I ordered and my food isn't in front of me. Contacting the restaurant directly and even asking for help on Zomato support chat have lead nowhere. I have neither received a response, or a refund or even an extremely delayed delivery. Insanely frustrating!!!",1
Disappointed in this app... They don't give the services as they advertise.... Vellets don't bring the right orders... They forget the order... They ask for high added tax... And while giving the credits... They wanna give the amount of the order as it is a and not the actual price paid....,1
"An evening at FML is never a dull boring experience. Back after nearly over 6 months' lockdown, it seemed like it never closed... ambience, music, service, food and everything was bang on. Safety/hygiene protocols are followed strictly, tables sanitized regularly. Staff as usual is very pleasant and courteous. Dhruv, you rock ! FML rocks !!",5
App sucks and business too. Everytime i use it sucks more and more. Never got delivered on time and customer support is full big delay and carelessness. Waste of time and money. Better use swiggy. I get disappointment every time i use ty his app. I ordered food for me and my friends and it showed that it will get delivered in 30 mins but now it has been 1hr 30 mins. Seriously it sucks. My money got wasted completely.,1
"Zomato's service is great! Reason of my 1 star: Today I got notification from Zomato saying that ""Biryani misses you"" I, who have not had Biryani in last three months clicks on that notification in the hope of eating biryani today gets a page saying we are not delivering in your area. :( In my opinion, that's pure evil. If you can't deliver don't get my hopes up. It hurts! :'(",1
"This app is totally rubbish. Showing fake discounts and offers, increasing our crave, taking us high and then dropping so hard. First of all, 90% of the restaurants in this app doesn't deliver to my location ( The centre of the city - Bengaluru).. U find ur desired food and are ready to order and then u find out that ""This restaurant does not deliver to your location"".... Disgusting it is. Secondly, I haven't ordered anything from my account... still it shows you are not a new user and the 50% discount is not available to you - Such irritating it is. Please please improve the service.",1
useless service . i did not get the order but delivery person had updated the status as delivered. I tried connecting customer service but i had to wait till 20 mins but no reply. I paid for the food but these people are least bothered. Swiggy is much much better,1
Not able to lodge complaint about delivery,1
"very bad service. please don't try this app , when you are damn hungry. They will make us to wait for hours. please, don't fall for the offers that restaurant providing as service is worst. you won't get back your money once you lost from your wallet. And, please reach consumer courts or website to stop those type of cheatings.",1
"Was placing an order today and it was a paid order but they cancelled it saying ""not within the reach"". Why the hell then you took that order? Will get refund after 7 days.. Can't place another order without the refund. At least you should have options of giving refund in zomato wallet or something. Spoiled my surprise. Sucks. Highly disappointed.",1
Please make sure that not to accept an order when the restaurants are closed. Add to your app itself the moment customer chooses that perticular restaurant that they are closed & to go for an alternative. Notification for the same does not arrives immediately. Thank you.,4
"Most of the time the food has quality and quantity issues, but they are not addressed. They just gives formal reply and we feels the money it's wasted, it happened with me for three consecutive orders.",2
"I use Zomato very often. Atleast 10 times per a month. Last night around 9.10 pm, I have ordered chicken biryany through zomato. I receaved very bad quality, less quantity of the same. Pieces are merely suitable to biryani. In one word, it is leftover biryani only.! I have tried to report the same, and get the refund. But, you guys, only diverting the issue to avoid the refund. ""I am a farmer. I don't eat free food"" pre defined issues in the chat box are not much useful to the customers.",1
Gud fool delivery! fast and speed ....,5
"Worst Experience with Zomato. first time installed app. Given order for food and transaction success from Bank but in order history it shows payment not received so have to give order again..?? Where's my money which was sent to Zomato from my Bank. One more interesting thing after sometime when i check order history, it shows nothing... !!",1
My first order on the app was a mess. They cared about my issue and took no action for the inconvenience I have gone through. Agents were acting like super bosses and have no fear or sense of talking to a customer .,1
"After seeing complete Zomato app my understanding is that Zomato is a food talk forum only. After using Foodpanda & Swiggy, this app looks like a clumsy newspaper full of text/photos, No way to place order to many restaurants which r shown open now. I seriously suggest developers to carefully look other 2 apps and learn.",1
"I accidentally pressed the place order. Immediately within a minute I asked to cancel but the zomato guy responded that my delivery has already left. On top of that it showed 20 minutes for delivery, but the delivery guy called and told it would take 1 hour, I said I can't wait for that long rather refund me. Zomato guys said the money would be refunded in 48 hour But Zomato guys did not did not refund and said I asked to cancel the order. What non sense and height of unprofessionalism is this",1
"The app is not even opening in the first place. I installed, and then when i tried to login via google, a message just keeps on appearing, saying something went wrong. I tried reinstalling, but same thing happened.",1
Worst experience by Zomato. They are playing games with the customers... They don't chat with us or even there is no calling to customer support. It's the worst food delivery app. If we raise a concern about the food is not cooked. They will say to wait for 48 hours for a reply through mail. Don't use this app anyone.,1
"Numerous restaurants are there, so you get proper choices of food, but this app doesn't show the real time tracking (maybe some bug, which may be fixed). Overall the app is good to Use.",4
The customer care support team is totally ineffective and useless. On several occasions they have proved that they don't even bother about the kind of service provided by their restaurant partners or valets. It used to be a really good platform before...but all good things come to an end!,1
Everytime i face a issue with food they do not respond. Everytime they tell they have escalated the issue and they will get back. But they never get back. Highly disappointing. Please use swiggy. There customer service is excellent.,1
On the total price add the taxes charges and then give discount of those taxes so ultimately you have to pay the full price of your order not any benefits to the customers. We have to pay actual and same price of the total order which restaurants are offering. Fake scheme of the coupons.,1
"app is good but problem is with delivery, zomato is always unanle to deliver in prescribed time. From 17 dec 2018 to till date, I am facing delayed delivery issue with zomato. Today even an order from pizza hut got delayed for 15 mins and there is no one to listen my issue. Fed up of working style of Zomato",1
Service is good,4
kindly increase the range of delivery..i mean the range from resturent to home..i live near a village from where the city is just 10 to 12 km away...i'm ready to provide a good amount of delivery charge as well as ready to get the food though it is cold.Also i dont care about how much time it is taking...in short..i am bored of cooking that daily common foods...😒,1
The chat system is so poor. No issue ever gets resolved over chat. The delivery boy did not even contact me once and cancelled the order saying the location was incorrect. whatever the location be the delivery boy has to contact the customer before cancelling the order,1
"I opted for On time or free delivery, and when the time ran out a zomato support person calls me that we are cancelling your order due to a technical issue, i was hungry and waiting for the order to arrive, really worst app, never order by this app, Swiggy is better then you people",1
"Hello Team, This app has stopped working on my moto g5s plus since last 2 updates. On opening the app, it becomes unable to load content inside app and it shows 'try again' all the time. Very rarely content loads and i have become unable order anything. Please check and resolve this issue.",1
It say 50 %off and gives only 100rs off seems like Manipulating customers with misleading offers.... I didnt get all the pizza to choose from pizza hut only selected are avaliable & cost are way more than pizza hut delivers... Zomato offers more than approx 1000 for 2 medium pizza after applying all offers where pizza hut offers less than 600 for 2 medium pizza if you apply offers...recommended dont install it better go and buy the food from hotels orginal sites.or call hotel for delivery.. ..,2
This just makes my lufe easier. As i am a student and live in hostel this app is just perfect for my food cravings. Whenever i want to eat something i just order from zomato and the order comes to my place in between half hour. Loved the app!,5
Kept cancelling orders after half an hour of confirmation. Really irritating when you're very hungry and have no food at home. Atleast could have cancelled it in the beginning. Still waiting for my refund.,1
"""Wish there was an option of not selecting any stars"" I ordered from a restaurant called ""MIDNIGHT EATS"" around 2.45 AM the restaurant accepted my order and I also paid online. But after 20 minutes the delivery calls and tells that the order is been cancelled cause I stay in an unsafe area it seems!!!!!!!!!! I stay in JAMALIA, Perambur 600012. Worst part is I tried reaching the customer care number to ZOMATO and there was no response! I tried the Chat services and they only said HI.",1
I liked zomato services. My experience was good with zomato. They really cares for customers needs and requirements. They have such a huge variety on our platter to choose from. We have offers from our local favourites but on better prices and excellent offers.,4
App is good. Navigation is easy. But coming to the orders they can take them but are not responsible for the delay and any other issues. you have to contact the restaurant directly or die of hunger.,3
I ordered a Large Pizza through Google pay Zomato order feature but received a regular pizza costing me ₹812 and was unable to lodge a complaint and ask for refund as Zomato has no helpline no. Or any user friendly customer service facility available. My experience was so terrible that I'm never gonna use Zomato ever and I would have given 0 stars which it rightly deserves but I'm still hoping that this review might change something.(I'm not stingy but instances like this are irritating.),1
It's been very Useful,5
In swiggy we can write r problem but there is no option of writing. I wanted to add more items to the order but there was no option like that . But this feature is in swiggy. But anyway it is good.,3
Given 2 stars only for metro cities where it works but do not depend on this in non metro cities. I faced issues. I was having empty stomach anf waited for 1 hour at last have to cancel this. issue faced in mathura may be it works in other cities lets hope.,2
"i am from pondicherry. compared to swiggy and uber... zomato delivery time so slow... like 15 min to 20 min slow all the time i tried. And every time order food from any hotel the delivery person does not follow the path given on the map, instead he allways chooses the longest route as possible.",3
They don't value their customers. I placed and order with Zomato and paid the order online it's been a month i was automatically refunded partially but my amount is hold and the partial amount isn't refunded and I don't think so that it would be refunded ever. I have stopped using this app. Better is you can switch to UberEats. I am having a good experience with them.,1
"Well done, lovely user friendly updates, superb choices, very efficient, great discounts and deals, excellent customer service, have started liking it more & more. Just want more budget friendly restaurant with lower prices, bargain deals & efficient orders to be incorporated with no minimum orders and free delivery to support them too in these tough times",4
Disgusting service ...previously they used to provide customer service via chat or call but now an automated machine responds back with some customised answers..that's really annoying sometimes....they dont evn keep track of proper contact number of restaurants or some brands like DOMINOS...VERY DISAPPOINTED...,1
"They charged 110/- as cancellation fees. The order was for 110/- . With in 5 seconds of ordering i cancelled because my mistake i entered wrong delivery address. I realized immediately and canceled the order, but no refund from zomato. Worst app.",1
WORST APP EVERRRRRRRR. my order was cancelled by the restaurant due to some gas leakage from their end & its been one month havent received the refund yet plus 3 times the payment was deducted but order wasnt placed. They dont have a customer service where we can talk to someone its only through chats (most of the agents are rude ) & emails which they take ages to reply. Worst app & worst experience everrrrr. Giving it one star as i cannot post a review without giving a star.,1
"Worst service ever. they take your money and get order cancelled and return it after few days. they launch offers like predict cricket match and win zomato credits. if you win, you will get credits for sure of 1 week validity. you order using it. then it gets cancelled. now zomato credita gone.you will get it back after 4 days. you won't get notified for it, but it will get expired on the 5th day and zomato credits gone. you chat with support, they say its just gone.",1
Very Bad Experience..All restaurants are not accepting orders.. Delivery taking lots & lots of time..One day i got 2 hours late delivery from zomato..Their advertisement are fake not fastest Delivery at all..Zomato is giving no response for the delivery..They even don't apologise their mistake..Very Very Dissatisfied.. Delivery very very very poor..Thanks,1
it was ny first order on Zomato. They delivered cold and old food. I raised the issue and customer support told they have assigned it to a team and they will contact after investigation. I waited for the resolution. But never got any. Came back after 7 days and 10 days. Got tbe same statement which they gave on first day. Its been 12 days still waiting for the investigation to be done and refund. I guess the investigation is being done by CBI or FBI. Should I ask Defence Minister directly?,1
Very Bad support for Customers who cannot get refund incase of wrong order you received or you cannot complain about the quality and quantity. Please try any other food apps rather than trying Zomato. Ordering food is like walking in the dark. They won't refund for wrong orders.,1
"Placed order and waited for 1 hour (supposed to come in 30 mins), the delivery guy called me and spoke in some language which I don't understand. He doesn't understand English or any other languages that I know of. Somehow I understood that he is asking for WhatsApp location which I sent to him. Now he is saying he can't deliver to the given address as it is very far and customer care said the location mapping is pretty bad Zomato app. Pathetic!",1
"For the past one week or more Zomato is not accessible using mobile network (for mine it's Airtel)... But working fine with WiFi connection.. Dev and testing team should focus on this issue.. redmi note 5 pro is my mobile device.. it's very disappointing that u guys didn't noticed or looked after this issue... Note: Am using the latest update of Zomato app ie, 9:42 pm IST October 05 2020... So it's not the update issue.. thanks",1
"I accidentally pressed order. I then called the restaurant to tell them not to make the order as i was gonna cancel it. I talk to chat support they say no matter what they will take the money from me. I mean, food prepation had not started. The delivery agent had also not gone to the restaurant. The order should be able to be canceled. But no,they say we will take the money.",1
"Everything is perfect except customer service, if the food is not good, we contact customer service, we don't get refund, instead we get irritated. customer service is very annoying. thanks",3
Worst experience. Chat support is just for informing. Ordered food and order automatically cancelled and amount deducted. So called Chat support straight away denied for refund. Chat support also don't reply properly. No money refunded at the end. A WORST FOOD DELIVERY APP.,1
The zomato gold which costs alomst 2k isa piece of garbage as i think of. The inapp discount purchases is not valid with gold. I tried to order two items costs a total 502 with inapp purchases and no gold. When i've applied gold for the same order the value is of 478. My thought about this is what is the use of buying a gold membership when you doesnt even have extra benefits along with other regular users. I hope thats what it is means having a memberships. Very disappointed in zomato.,1
"best customer care you'll ever find. wjevwr orders have come late or were mixed up, they've fully refunded me and have responded quickly. there's a lot on the internet about them, but statistically that's bound to happen owing to how many orders they deal with. these guys deserve some good reviews too, for all the work they've done. trust them and order people.",5
> It's very safe and hygienic > it is faster and easy to order anything you want to eat Thank you Zomato 🙏🙏🙏,5
"The app is has gotten worse over the last two years. You cannot search restaurants by area or cuisine. It's not easy to use. Drivers are not often friendly, my latest order came late and cold, this is a common occurrence.",1
worst app and you cant connect to customercare. I have an issue and zomato insisted me to wait 40 mins in queue and what I got reply is was our agent helpful without assigning one and I lost my money without getting any items I ordered. swiggy is the no.1 delivery app and they resolve issues in minutes.,1
"Online payment is still a trouble. My amount still not refunded 87 rupees. Whenever I asked customer support they are just saying simply refund status already refunded and it will take 3to 7 days. I waited about 20 days, still I didn't receive my refund amount. So don't pay online",1
Not user friendly. Address setting problem. I got head ache to set address. Most of restaurants which are available in swiggy are not available in zomato. Even in some restaurants some items are not available which are available in swiggy in same restaurant. Got very very bad experience with zomato.,1
"I was a regular customer of Zomato and didn't prefer any other application, untill the Zomato team couldn't help me in getting my cancellation charges reversal. There's no option of cancelling the order, due to which I couldn't cancel my order placed by mistake. After complaining about it to the team, they are not able to help in the issue. As per them, they have given a credit on my number which I can't see, for which they are giving a reason that ""I have deleted my account"". I don't understand how could they credit to my number if that number is not registered with Zomato. I am never going to use this app again just because they can't provide good customer services.",1
"Very bad experience.Cancelled order, one hour after accepting payment online & confirming order. Sent a message saying that the refund will be made within 2-7days. What a joke? Why 7 days? It's your failure. So you should arrange immediate refund.",1
Good service thank you so much....,5
"One of the worst delivering app. The delivery speed is very slow. They even threat us if we wish to cancel our order by saying you will get fined. I have a very bad experience. So, I suggest you to not use this app. Swiggy is better than it. But swiggy is also not a good app. The food looks that it is made two, three days ago. Sometimes it comes without tag because the delivery boy eats our food. That is my opinion regarding food delivering app. Please strictly read this.",1
"customer support system is just too slow, firstly they cancelled my order due to some lame reason n then again when i tried to order something it was taking ages for hotel to accept my order, trust me that hotel is only 10mins drive away from my place if I've gone there by myself i cud have it wud take half hr max to max but they took 20mins just to accept my order n when i tried to chat with customer support system they r showing ""chat wait time 9mins"" from last half n hr..... i can type more 😂",1
worst app. will take money approx 2 times and then offer discount 1/4 times. suppose you are buying something worth rs 100 on zomato. if you compare this with other price then you will find that same item is available on another food delivery app with rs 50 and that also without offer. now zomato says that there is a offer and they will give discount of 30 rs on the order and the total amount you will pay is rs 70 there by giving you loss.,1
"Worst delivery app amongst the top three: swiggy, zomato, uber eats. Better to order from uber eats or swiggy you might end up paying on few orders a few extra bucks but the customer care is commendable as with zomato they don't have any customer support if your order is messed up then all you can do is regret why you ordered from them. No calling number available just a automated reply and nothing else.",1
"Really bad support when ever anything goes wrong with the order. No one answers the support till hours... I ordered pizza today and it was handled so bad that it was completely crushed and when I asked for support they replied ""sorry"". Keep your sorry with you please.",1
Very pathetic experience. I will never recommend anyone to order from zomato. I have paid money online to get the food delivered. My wife is not well so I thought it as a gesture for her.I didnot recieve the food. I called the number the delivery guy on the phone did not respond to my query. He said ig is not his problem. He has switched off his phone. Zomato doesnot have customer support number. Zomato customer chat didnot give me any option to raise my complaint.,1
This app is very useful for us,5
very good app.. best offers.. the service charges are reasonable unlike some other apps as we see lot of difference when added to cart....it does not happen like that in zomato.. has very good pocket friendly offers with no service charge also for some restuarants..,1
Over charging and difference in prices. The price on app and the price on menu from restaurant is highly inflated. Also they exploit the delivery guys and restaurant. Finally I #supportzomatoguy who was falsely been removed for inappropriate behaviour from customer rather than the delivery guy itself,1
Very good service nd offered,5
No user friendly....ordered by mistake next second I initiated cancellation......atlast it asks yes or no for cancel...but yes selected with no response...it extended the time about 25 mins then it shows cancellation charge for prepared order amount Rs.221 paid along with next order...again asks yes or no for cancel......atlast I accepted the order with no other option....feeling cheated.....,1
Doesn't have live tracking feature during late nights. Delivery time is always breached. Swiggy is much much better. Worst of all is your support person works on terminating the issue at hand rather than solving it. Better pull your strings right,1
I have to change my review after my 1st order. Very dissatisfied from my order. I dont know why the heck thus app is not showing the reviws of the shops. also the pics of the orders should be provided against their names. My order was very wrongly delivered and the product wasnt the thing that I ordered. Also it was so tastless. 😠😠,2
I suggest there should be ZERO rating also Services are getting worse in app it show 30 minutes and we receive order like in hour except that order handling is not good by valets I have ordered two times pizza from la pinoz every time cheese and toppings were stuck to the box and when inquired about with the delivery boy he said it's not our problem because box size are big so zomato should stop pizza delivery,1
"Worst app ever, they just attract customers by discounts bt actually they just make fool. They never ever accept their faults instead they put all the blames on their vendors.. any says to vendor that don't accept ur fault. Yesterday night i gave the order for pizza, from half an hour the app was showing that in 15 min only i get the food ..bt actually i got the food after one hour. Never ever use this app",1
"It was one of my fav App, but now its worse then ever. Today i ordered something and just received half items to which i paid full, so i contacted zomato customer service and what they are saying that they can't do anything, its against there polices, seriously ? Cheating with customer are there polices. I have ordered from zomato 100 of times never face such issues but now making customer will make zomato surly closed one day. Bye Bye zomato seriously disappointed.",1
"Update - gotten worst, main problem delivery guy last delivery guy was rowdy abusive and threw food item..... app wont work at times, live tracking doesn't work and that timer is just a scam plus most important delivery omg they take at least minimum 1hr sadness even the restaurant or the place i ordered is very near and order is small....late delivery.",1
Easy to use app. However there should be a proper page that manages refunds for failed delivery. The rider can chose to claim that address is wrong or unable to deliver. Then our money is just gone. The other issue is restraunts suddenly going unavailable for ordering. Not sure why this happens.,4
"Selecting what to order is one thing ! Ordering food is next level. Whenever you try to order , it displays a message try again ...until the customer losses interest in ordering the food . Please maintain the app.",4
Fast and safetl delivery,5
Delivery & Resturant charge unexpected,1
"chat support very slow, needs to improve and increase support team. every time the app shows chat wait time is 1min. but they reply after 30mins and till then have to wait, if not just forget about the order nd the query will not be solved.",1
"I love Zomato but sometimes rarely I notice a bug in app. Like after ordering something, I can't view the order summary page. I can only see the updates through notifications and not actually being able to see location of the valet. If I press on the notification from below that your food is being prepared or anything, a white screen opens and data takes like forever to load.",4
"Very poor customer service. I ordered in a nearby restaurant at 3pm. At 4pm, the valet still haven't reached the restaurant and is just going in circles in the map. The agent I talked to in the chat is also not helpful. What a waste of time. Very bad experience.",1
"The only reason giving Zomato 4 star is they charge a little extra from the menu the food which near by restaurants deliver at 250 locally, Zomato charges the same at 450-500 even after applying coupons, first they will display a food at 350(original price being 250) then they will provide discount rs 50 then they'll add tax 40 packaging charge 60 and then 60 delivery.. They charge packaging even when there is no special packing of food",4
"I'm tired of the zomato issue..every day problems.Either from delivery boys or from a restaurant. I ordered(harsha dhaba) the food and the cash went out of my account and zomato said that menu is now available, So if zomato is bad then you should write the review as bad. I have been compliant in zomato for a few days now, I am staying in kakanad, infopark phase 1, cochin, kerala flat. When you take a hr interview and look at the cv, you do not know whether it is professional or not.",1
they didn't provide any receipt or other proof that we are getting food from the same restaurant we ordered. I doubt they buy food from local or street shops as the food quality doesn't match the restaurant level. Every time I order food I wasn't able to eat it because of its taste and quality.,1
The price of items are increasing everyday. Swiggy is offering the same at lower rate. Switching. To swiggy for while.,3
No problem whatsoever best app for food delivery just perfect,5
"50 % Discount I ordered a chicken whopper as i was too hungry. but what i get on a discount was a less quantity of veggies inside it to compensate the discount, it would be better if we buy it direct from the outlet only as on discount they will offer you less quantity. thats how these heavy discounts of Zomato works.",1
"More than anythin. CLEAR and intuitive UI of the app makes it better than others. Really love using app. Others have frustrating experience. Offers matter but when there are no offers i prefer zomato due to its awesome features, payment method options and cool app.",5
"i ordered food from a nearby restaurant using Zomato. my phone number was verified with an OTP before the order was passed to the restaurant. When I didn't receive my food for a long time I called the restaurant. They said the delivery boy has been trying to call me for more than 20 mins. Turns out that Zomato gave them an incorrect number. when i brought it to their notice, without apologising first, they asked me to update my ""correct"" number. thanks for the cold food, Zomato",1
Excellent food delivery app,5
"i have ordered somthing and they are very very dumb, i have a mail which i had to drop when their Customer support got blanked and. shared marketting and one more id to drop email. there are really worki g if they are not able to help over chat portal, they are just like bhai dusre ki galti hai meri nhi mai to help nhi kar pauga i have already dropped email on Jul 11 same time when i received your food spoiled ones kindly revert you guys are too slow,",1
Uninstalling. Till u take back kamaraj as Ur employee.,1
"Zomato has been a constant companion to manage my food cravings. It is a well-designed and competent service. I am reserving one star for the infrequent bad delivery partners. Still, it's definitely a great app to have. Thanks a ton to you guys.",4
one of the worst app i have ever seen no assistance for the customers in a proper manner and instead there will be also no proper menu for anything that they display in the app even contacting for the customer service for several times they will not at all help you . better download any other app for food and this is not a review that am giving for time pass it is purely my worst experience on it please take care guys!,1
"The Support Function is really more then bad, The support agent's never respond on real time and when you read the chat they came with apologies and left. From one of their restaurant me and my friend ordered food and we spend 2 weeks in hospital just because of food poisoning.",1
"Most of the times it's good but sometimes when you are hungry and then when you order, after waiting for half an hour the restaurant says that ""your order is declined, please try another restaurant"" then it is very irritating. kindly take a note of that",5
All food delivery apps are very very bad . Any of them did not have my location for delivery. They should make delivery available in my city(Azamgarh) .Its also for you all. :( . I am going to forward this message to all food delivery apps. Sorry to say but very dissapointing .,1
"I was initially interested for this app because of reviews and I placed an order first time but had really bad experience.The Non veg items were totally trash as well when i tried to report it the chat support was nothing but Computer generated answers.Even as they promote about their first 5 orders 50% off,was not worked for my second order.Totally disappointed.",2
Zomato needs to re look at the menu picture's displayed in the application as the picture of Family meal which I ordered is showing with beverages Cola (That's what made me order that particular deal ) however it's the actual menu is with out cola (beverages ). This is disappointing.,1
"Literally the worst customer care service ever. The chat bot is excruciatingly painful to interact with and the experience is simply horrendous to say the least. If you cannot develop the tech for it,please do not implement it in such a haste. Utter disappointment.",1
Worst experience You must have feature for showing only those restaurants which are accepting order rather than showing all and confusing your customers And one more point you should have feature that you can order from different restaurants at a time. You guys charge delivery charge for every restaurant which is not fair.,1
"So I tried zomato, to order. they have a support staff but that's not at all supportive. If you have any issue, it'll not be solved/ cannot be solved. they will not even try to help you out. They are only concerned payment, once you've paid for your order after that you shouldn't think that they will ASSIST you in any way possible.",1
Excellent... whenever you feel hungry live tracking helps a lot to get the delivery on doorstep. At times mostly i order coz of offers even when not that hungry. Dont have to worry about food for the hassle of going and searching a restaurant.,4
"Need to update the order confirmation system. I was in lucknow and the oreder was booked in indore . And it was a technical fault, every order shall be verified properly. The most disappointing point was that i had to pay the fine i.e cost of food.",2
"I hate that now I can't filter my bookmarks. It's really inconvenient and something no one ever asked for. If I want to visit a high end place one day and a budget place the other, how am I supposed to choose one among the many many places I have bookmarked?",1
I feel bad that there is no zero star rating option.I placed an order and it didnt get placed but money was deducted. they said i will get my money back in 2 days for 7 days. The customer care keeps this message in chat and they stop replying after that.I still didnt get my money back.,1
Please stop spamming our notification bar with your promotional messages.,1
They started out as so convenient. Now it's no longer the case. Food is 80% of the time late. Chat support mocks customers in their replies. I am definitely starting to use other apps.,2
"worst experience, though after order cancelled very next minute, im forced to pick company call which asks to pay for order cancellation and keep on calling untill pickup, 10 times is the dirtiest job. on the app, they provide call symbols first is of where dish is cooked and second to whome is delivering. it aint falt of mine ti dial first symbol to cancle order and heartly sorry didnt dial second call symbol.",1
Great app... they are capable of disabling the keyboard in your mobile in their chat window.. i was trying to cancel the order in a minute after placing the order and they are ready to charge the complete amount as cancellation fee.. worst service,1
"they have lately registered some cheap joints, which are very unprofessional. The app gives least priority to prepaid orders. If you want to cancel your prepaid order for heavy delay they threaten to charge you cancellation charges . I do not recommend prepaid orders on this app.",2
App is not that user friendly ... Trying to show all the contents into a single screen. Especially the navigation to account section to view ongoing order is a small button on the top right which u have to aim and tap. The UI doesn't have difference between contents and a small bar which shows info..,3
"experienced a serious delivery issue. the restaurant close to my house (3km),they showed a delivery time of 15 min.but the valet moved to a far away place after picking up my order and I had to wait for 45 mins to see that the foo will be delivered to me only after 33 mins. very bad service.",1
worst app ever Don't give order ratings. There are many flows in app. The customer support is also worst. they provide offers coupons and then if you order and give the rating for order then those offers will disappears and in return you will get only appology from customer support.,1
"Pathetic delivery... They assign a delivery agent with more than one order to deliver... Your order will take 1 hour to reach you aps the delivery guy makes a tour of the city... No real person to respond or make a complaint to... All we get the lame delivery guy or the stupid chat support with their apologies... update: again cheated by zomato...3/9/19,order not delivered...delivery guy never turned up...no way to call the guy or connect with zomato...only lame chat which is of no help",1
"I am totoally disappointed with the service of zomato. A few days back i ordered kaju katli (Delhi) and i had paid via debit card. Despite giving the correct address, the rider didn't delivered the item which i had to send to my friend. The rider didn't responded well. So, i have now started using swiggy and have also urged my friends, colleagues and families to stop using zomato because of their careless attitute towards their customers.",1
"Zomato gives the most pathetic service of them all. It's been two days in a row that I always face disappointment whenever I order food from them. Their site doesn't work properly anyway. They give such great offers but don't let customers avail it without paying online that's because once they receive their payment ,their service just goes down the line.they haven't even registered a customer care number whereas their delivery guys do have a customer care number. One has to chat in order to clear any query. Yesterday I ordered five samosas and they were delivered to me exactly after 2 hours of ordering and even then the food delivered was wrong. WOW. and same was today, I ordered a combo and I didn't get any coke with it although It was mentioned in my order and the bill. And nobody has responded to my query thereafter. The food delivered was completely cooled off and their was a hair in my burger so I had to throw half of it away. Just pathetic service.",1
"I wanted to give stars in minus but as this is not possible, I am giving one star. This app steals your money. When I placed my order it said the transaction failed, try another payment method. But money debuted from my account. I thought money will be refunded hence I placed another order. The placed both my orders and did not even provide option to cancel. And these thieves don't even provide good customer support.",1
"More than 2 months of having posted the review, but no response from them, disappointing. Many restaurants/food outlets, though not far from my home, are not available on this app., only 3 options to choose from. Really poor service here in Palanpur. Please add all available food joints on the list to increase customer reach.",1
"Great app. ( But still needs editing in menu content in app )Zomato is by far the app with widest range of restaurants in my area. The offers they are giving are also great, but I wish they could also permit the offers on cash on delievery.",5
"The app and platform is all good, but when it comes to home delivery, I'd prefer other apps. Doesn't show all the places and order bookings take time. The gold offer and dine out options are always on point!",4
"In some restaurants, the cost of dishes in zomato is listed more than the actual rate. After that, even if Zomato gives discount, then the discounted price becomes 10-15 rupees more than the actual price. The customers who never visited these restaurants think that they are getting good discounts from Zomato but actually they end up paying more than the food's actual price. In short, the Zomato promocodes is a SCAM, and unsuspecting customers think they are actually getting discounts.",1
"Zomato is one of the worst food delivery site. Their delivery boys not picking calls and not behaving well. I ordered my food from zomato and wait more than an hour after that their delivery boy not picking up the call.. the restaurant vendor called me and said sir your order is ready but zomato didn't send their delivery boy and after chating with zomato customer care they simply said sorry sir ur order has been declined. It's my humble request with you guys that use other food delivery sites. Zomato Simply betrayed their customers. Also they ruined the image of good restaurants,I ordered from Chawla restaurant and zomato customer Care told me that restaurant is unable to prepare your order, I called in Chawla restaurant and inform them they said that they prepared my order on time but due to zomato poor service your order can not be delivered ,Chawla owner called zomato delivery boy but that person not picked up the call. So please don't order from zomato and use other apps. Worst experience with zomato.",1
"Pathetic customer service. If there is any problem with the order then no one has any ownership on the issue,.. The rates on Zomato portal are higher than the actual rates and the quantity of food delivered is less than the standard quantity delivered by the outlet. Zomato don't clearly share the restaurant address, rather they deliver from duplicates of the good take away restaurants.",1
The app was better before....now even to check the menu on the phone thru the browser it tells to install the app from play store...and with the app It limits the restaurants for a specific dish for example I search for tandoori prawns and the app gives me only 1 restaurant in whole of doha ... uninstalling the app if the restriction of location based restaurant is not rectified...its like the restaurant guys have paid zomato to show just their restaurant when searched.,1
"Worst support Executive and his explanation. Just to time pass and some system generated response. We are making our life complicated by thinking of easiness. Zomato is the worst among worst . If you are ok with the food comes or not and having sufficient time then order and break your head. Thanks to mr. Parveiz who chart more than 30 mins and not able to give a proper reply... Finally lost money , frustrated without food and lunch time over will wait for a tea break to have some thing.",1
"Pathetic delivery service...I had to wait till 12 pm at night to get delivery, the order which I made at 9 pm. And customer service agent didn't cancel even after repeated ask nor did they help in getting it delivered. While promoting gold, they say it's 1+1 but they only reduce Rs 300 from order.",1
serious issues with the app they don't reply on chat support the restaurant linked don't pick up calls.... you can't rely on such app when you need your food urgently.... better to go out and eat than to keep on waiting for hours to get the food delivered.,1
I just love this all. I am a food lover and just love to eat. So this app has every thing in it all the restaurants and u can even fine the dining places with the price is too written for per person. just love this app.,5
"Economy and quality , price very affordable . Standard is good.",5
"its not working at all. It is struck at the screen saying ""something went wrong, please try again later."" everything other application is working fine except zomato so can't be a internet issue as well.",1
"Very poor customer support. If you seek their help about an unmoving unreachable delivery valet, they'll confirm that the valet is indeed not moving and not reachable, and they'll 'HOPE' that the valet will move soon to pick the order. What an joke of a customer support and delivery valets. Helping customers with hopes and prayers.",1
"My Complain No. -2335114 against ""incorrect order received as well support chat system app is not working'. Then I mailed them and Zomata automatic reply came that my complain will be solve within 24-48hrs but still now no email came from their executive team. It is total harasment to a customer. Kindly fix your support chat system and take action regarding my incorrect product.",1
Hasalfree and fastest delivery of delicious food,5
very very very disappointed by Zomato's response for the unauthorized transaction done by any other account through my Paytm wallet. it doesn't help me either way for the refund. The customer care service numbers are out of reach or fake. The deduction of my money to zomato is unauthorized transaction though zomato didn't ask an OTP to do that. Or I can accuse zomato after that video that Zomato itself done a transaction with my wallet.,1
"used to be good. now you can wait for hours to get your cold food. chat is very slow and they might take 20 minutes to answer with a robotic message. they do get you a refund, but i would rather get my food on time",1
one of the best food delivery app. I am using this app in multiple countries and observed that there is a discrepancy in the offers provided in respective regions. Zomato also charges more than the actual restaurant prices offered in india as per their Menu. Appreciate if the service could be transparent for fees / surcharges.,5
"Horrible experience, restaurants that do not deliver to the locallity are also displayed, order gets cancelled even after being accepted, search engine is very poor, closed restaurants are also displayed. This app could be useful if it was updated.",1
"well, didn't really intend to give a 1 star but since I wasn't at all satisfied with my previous experiences , I had to. I have mailed zomato ample of times but neither did I get any satisfactory response nor my refund for the cancellation of an item I had ordered. plz look into the matter",1
I have still waiting for my order. It was expected to deliver by 8:15 PM. My experience was pathetic. Got my order 45 minutes late n didn't hear about order being late from anyone. I won't recommend this app for ordering food.,1
They don't solve your query now. Earlier agents used to chat with us and help us but now they just tell us to email them and never revert back. Their coupons also don't work. I applied a coupon but didn't receive cashback. Their services are going down.,1
"i have been using swiggy quite frequently and just wanted to give another try today to zamato. i had a very bad experience with zamato previously. i have order a pizza today and when imipen the pizza it wasn't in a Situation to eat, Entire cheese and toppigs were just got spread across box ..i.have shared the images with delivery boy, merchant and zamato chat box. ... response was worst frim zamato representative...No one was reasy to talk stating that they don't have voice support... worst",1
I am waiting from last 40 minutes restaurant showing 20 minutes time...what is that .... Will I accept order tomorrow...worst app....worst GPS system ....nothing is actual or exact information....don't order if you are hungry...only order when you eat to tomorrow then order today may be you'll eat food the day after...,1
Very good service,5
Worst services. Delivery agents r not good. I hav mentioned correct address while placing the order but the delivery guy informed to the cust care that my address is wrong.I placed hundreds of orders to that place .It seems the delivery guy wantedly cheated me. Even chat option is disabled in app and phone cust care always sucks even they r not responding on twitter. Really cheaters.,1
"When the valet is not available, they should provide service at all... Money doesn't matter. But while starving, we order food via this app to have some delicious food. But if the valet is not available, they shouldn't provide service.... I ordered food and waited for nearly 1 hour... No valet assigned and order cancelled. Iam gonna sleep with hunger now... Worst service ever had",1
"worthless service, no resolution on wrong deliveries. rather the customer care agent is so audacious he direcly refuses to resolve issues, right on the face. i produced photographs of my order which was a starter but i was served gravy instead. but the agent refused to acknowledge any gravy in the pic. further he went on to reply that ""i am sorry i cannot resolve the issue"". is this what customer service is, u dumb morons. do u even have business ethics. u numbnuts wittless shitholes.",1
Very good service,5
Experience was not at all good. 2 or 3 times this thing has happened that order was not delivered but it showed as delivered on the app and when i contacted the support team no help was given to me and i never got my money back for those orders which were not delivered . I will never recommend Zomato to anyone .,1
"Total waste. Zomato support is very very very bad. Whatever the issue is, big or small, the resolution procedure is too annoying. Everytime you will be forced to send a mail. Poor customer support.",1
"Please make sure that your shops follow protocols properly . We ordered late night, order was approved, delivery time was shown 38 mins...later we get a call from shop that its closed , and guess what no refund ! Am damn sure if i see any of your tomato guys in my area am gonnna blast them for sure .",4
"Pathetic experience with zomato staff and app. My order was not delivered even after an hour when app was showing ""arriving in 7 minutes"". No help from customer support as they were not able to contact their rider as well as restaurant like me. No apology no eagerness to resolve the issue. Will never order again with them",1
What a nonsense strategy this app is using... Order above 325 or you can't order anything...what the hell is this? First they are charging very high charges besides the restaurant charges and after that this disgusting demand... I will never use this app again... This is taking the wrong advantage of their users...,1
"Really pathetic service. Despite being a gold member, they keep cancelling the order after placing the order for 30-45 min. for some lame excuse without even informing and then refund the money after 4-5 days. Request folks to try some other food delivery app.",1
"Service is good.the delivery person rating is our choice. But they were asking to give good rating. This is not good. Basing on the delivery time, behavior, appearance etc... The rating will be given... Please guide them if possible. No it's zimato's responsibility to guide them.",3
"Pathetic service. Please introspect how can customer highlight any issue against food. Restaurants and vendors sometimes give pathetic food. It's a 20 min delivery. Accepted. Zomato service as logistic is good. But quality of food? Isn't that important? You charge for cancellations and refuse to give COD facility to customers who deny to accept orders, but there is no alternative than returning back. Your chat service don't serve any purpose. Vendors enjoy giving stale food to Zomato orders.",1
Very bad taste of food from some available restaurants... kindly minimize the restaurants count to deliver a quality food from top restaurants which serve best food to customers... som times we are not receiving same what we have ordered...many times complained but no use.. simply saying sorry for the inconveniences when we talk and chat with zomoto service... delivery boys are not delivering food at the plot.. calling and saying come to down to pic your order.. Request to please look into this,2
"This is my second review. I thought after 1st complaint they would change a bit but no, there is no positive response from zomato. Worst part is that they don't have a customer care number. We are not fools sitting around and complaining our grievances to bots. They don't accept cod if order is not of a particular amount and if you do online payment their delivery guy will not deliver your food insted they will blame you for the same and won't even return your money. Zomato should be banned.",1
horrible experience! I ordered for the first time and received a wrong item. When i tried to reach helpdesk (only chat option is available) i had to wait for 25 mins for someone to respond. Swiggy is way better than your service. Improve your basics rather than spending on ads please?,1
I don't understand Zomato they are adding different charges like distance charge surcharge GST and bla bla don't know and ₹200 dish becomes ₹300 dish. If we can direct order from restaurant that saves lots of money food becom cheaper as compared to Zomato.. A restaurant located just 200 to 300 meters away ask for distance charge Really Zomato??,1
Deserves no stars. But unfortunately thats not the option. Very poor customer support. The item once ordered disappears after it's received. We can't really verify the items we ordered and what we received. Literally fooling people by taking our money. No more zomato orders. Only swiggy.,1
The new zomata gold update policy is not good. One 2 gold unlocks per table seriously and only 1 unlock per day. Please undone this policy. Dont give zomata gold on delivery. It would be better if previous policy is impemented again. It was the best part of having gold instead of other premium upgrades from different vendors like dineout etc,1
"I ordered from Zomato, i waited for half an hour or so and then i get a notification saying restaurant has cancelled the order. now i already paid for it, and i had to book another order from a different restaurant seperately. They say my phone was unreachable so the whole amount paid wad treated as cancellation charges. I mean you make the customer wait, then cancel the order, your delivery man Doesn't deliver, even when he has the address, and then i am charged? How pathetic service!!",1
"Pathetic service, always late. Now they want us to gamble if the food is going to be late or not! Seriously RULE 101 of customer service, orders shouldn't be late. Or else there's other options too.",1
"The live location kept buffering with new increased ETA after every 10 minutes. Even after asking the chat support agent, he/she told me a status which no where matched the live location. Received food after an hour with wrong item. Worst experience with Zomato till date.",1
"As always the case, there is delay of more than half an hour in delivery of food, what zomato does, just send fix automated message...no support no help, even after one hour it shows food is in the kitchen, so gives no update whatsoever",1
"i ordered food for dinner, i didn't get any call and they cancelled my order saying my phone was not reachable, whereas i received 2-3 small calls during that time also, if others can reach me why can't they, i was still ok but than i checked they haven't refunded my money. i tried thr customer care chat they are showing 1 minute wait for last 20 minutes. After few minutes Restaurants in my area would stop taking orders. what kind of customer service is this.Now ty said we will not return urmoney",1
"They simply don't cover enough restaurants for a particular area.. (As compared to a Swiggy or uber Eats). In nanakramguda hyderabad, for example, Swiggy has at least 40+ options covering most of gachibowli and hi tech city restaurants while Zomato has barely 20 options. Same goes for sr Nagar area. All in all, the service is decent enough without being extraordinary.",4
I m in love with this app......U guyzz r doing a fantastic job by making all d restaurants fall at one place and making it convenient for ur customers to choose from wide range of restaurants......N ya...ur service is also so fast......I haven't faced any problem wid ur service till now....,5
Do not fall for their false promise of 100% cash back on any order if you opt for zomato gold. 100% cash back will never be received and you will unnecessarily pay 1800 for gold membership. Its totally rubbish here I cannot rate zero stars else I would have surely given zero stars for them. Even after repeated chats on support when we ask for cash back they keep mute without any answer.,1
I have recently experienced something. I ordered pizza from Dominos. But it didnt deliver. Besides when I tracked the order it showed that it is delivered. I really had a very bad experience. Never going to use the app again.,1
Worst service ever. They didn't refund my money for second time. Hate this app. I would have given lesser ratings if I could have. They are not refunding my money from last 1 month and making all kind of excuses about it.,1
Not delivering at right location 😕,2
I have been using this app for a while now and I am always surprised that how fast it provides me with my food. Being a foodie is not easy but this app made it for me! 😋 I am always happy using #zomato and I will recommend this app to all those who are reading my description right now.,5
"Additional charges is too much,, when I was select 300rs Items, u r charging near 70rs for delivery, distance and surcharge fee, after that package charges and GST. For 300rs order I have to pay near 400rs. It's too much. Otherwise it's good application.",2
Ive never had such disturbing experience with any other service provider app .The money is getting deducted however the order is not getting placed upon enquiry they lie in the chat support that the product is unavailable but when contacted the hotel itself ..the hotel confirm s that all the products are available . This is happened not 2 or 3 times literally 6 times with me to be precise . Lie is highly unethical . The chat support system is so useless. SWIGGY is alot better n gives lovely servi,1
"it's a very worst app, i have ever seen.I have ordered food in that app and paid money thru netbanking and they reduced money from my account...But when i get back to app page it shows 504 error ocurred. when i tried to contact the customer service they aren't much responsible.I dont have any order id from the app,the service person will not care abt your money guys...so dont install this app.very much frusturated.@zomato app. I haven't received any order id so dont rply this with ur normal cmnt",1
Worst experience......will not recommend.......Would not like to give even one star..... do not treat their customers in good manner... very arrogant staff... need lot of training..... we booked this place for 24 persons and they just switched off the ac even though all were having their dinner and to top it ..... very rude bouncers stand on your head.... when asked to step aside they are ready for a fight...will not recommend this place for any party,1
"Zomato app is getting degraded day by day. We select restaurants and whenever try placing an order, suddenly they do not accept orders. Apparently high surge will need extra money to warrant peoper delivery!!! So far it has been a very bad experience with zomato.",1
Item not complete received,1
horrible experience. first my order was delayed by 1 hour and then they gave me the wrong order. when I tried to contact them there was no response. they have very bad system plus they charge more and the customer care is never available. its like throwing away your money,1
Very good service,5
Every order has a issue. Either food is missing. Or delay in delivery or after order is placed restaurant will start buying the ingredients to cook. Wait for 2hrs. Better we will only cook or go directly to restaurant. Waste to use this app.,1
"the most incompetent, pathetic, irritating customer service i have ever seen. I have faced 3 issues in the past which could have been solved easily with a little support from the customer care team but each time all they had to say was, ""once the order is placed, we can't do anything.""",1
"This app is reading my messages for OTP even when I have not given it permission to do so. Just for the sake of asking again and again, you can't choose to go ahead and read my messages in advance before I have agreed to that permission. This is a huge privacy issue!",1
Everything is good except one thing. Many restaurants do not recieve online delivery order from Zomato at night approx 9:30 PM...but same restaurants receive order at the same time from Swiggy. This is one thing which annoys at that time and forces us to use Swiggy.,4
"Very poor service. All the time late for delivery. Normally all restaurants make delivery within an hour. When after my order, I waited more than 1 hour, I called the restaurant where I ordered food, they said that the courier from Zomato had not arrived yet.",1
IT is the worst of worst app because the ui that this app has is worst.The menu design is pathetic.The time for the delivery is like anything. I orderd a burger from my mac donal which was less than 500m and they took 45 min to diliver it. means what are they doing in this time i could even go there and have orderd 2 burgers. and whenever the order is done in the map they show that the food is being prepared for past 20 mins. I want to tell zomato that pl see to all this and update your app.,1
App is working good. But the restaurants are very worse not getting the delivery as expected Simply they were add som rice n pieces Don't know when it was prepared Kindly look into the restaurants what quality they are using and whether they are preparing it after confirming the order or simply they are packing with the left over food,4
Best app or food delivery,5
"ive had a zomato account for many years and I am very upset about how deteorating the customer service has become. it has just become an automated written response chat whenever I have asked for why my order is late I have received response that you have had a lot of credits in the past so nobody can assist you. how is that even related to the current order status.also,zomato shows that the restaurant has accepted the order and after waiting for 45 minutes I get a message that order is cancelled",1
Numerous time happened restaurant accepts the order and when we check after delivery time mentioned in order via support chat get to know that hotel has cancelled the order. Not satisfied with the service and as customer we can't rate the hotel on adherence part. Company also don't take any action sad to say.,2
awesome service as always from the starting till now ....... n also it gave few more credits points to me when some of my food order was not good enough but from past few days v are not getting good services from zomato people's through some restaurants delivered food wherein i got 2wooden sticks inside of food while eating......... still no positive assurance n feedback have came from zomato n restaurant people too inspite of sending them the pictures n everything,5
Zomato service is no more reliable now. Last two order got cancelled after 45 minutes of placing order. Then you suddenly in problem and start finding alternative immediately. Never order from zomato when you are planning for guest. Guest may have to return back hungry.,1
This app doesn't have any feature where I can rate the food. I ordered food and they sent us rotten food and there is no way in their chat bot to address this issue. I have to drop a mail for this.,3
Best app better than swiggy because of many no. of restaurants than swiggy and big discounts and less delivery charges as compared with swiggy,5
The support I received was of no use. The agent replied after 60hrs almost. And he has just copied pasted his default response. No resolution. I couldn't eat the pizza here and they just notified the restaurant to improve their service. I mean wow.,1
"Food is very important to an individual and Zomato has done a great job tk bring the best food places together. It allows one to check the reviews and get to know the nest dishes cooked and best sellers. The only glitch is the cooking instructions part. The input from customers is not guaranteed which allows the restaurants to ignore the request or skip it. This has happened multiple times with ELCO restaurant,Pizza hut .when confronted they simply say we did not look at it or missed it.",3
"Inspite of being a regular customer as my dinner is always delivered by Zomato, the app never goes online the moment i open the app. I have to restart the app more than dozens of times to get the desired restaurant to order my food. Its high time you get the services perfect at Sambalpur, Odisha.",1
"Had a horrible experience chatting with customer support. When it works its good, otherwise the customer service people makes you go mad and plays with you. Edit I just checked the app to find restaurants for dine in but it is showing only for delivery. Poor app.",1
Placed order from a restaurant and entered our location address manually but it picked up some other location automatically.We got call from rider confirming our address and all.After half an hour their executive call us and says we need to cancel the order as you have entered wrong address.Without giving any other options like pick up by ourself or anything else the order get cancelled with *NO REFUND*.We repeated our order with COD option with random address and order got delivered to us.FRAUD,1
"Really bad app, it's been 1 and half hour no response from restaurant, number not getting connected, live chat no response, no option to cancel the order, it's 3rd time am having issues with tomato, first time restaurant cancelled my order, second delay in delivery third no news about nothing...",1
there are many restauranta which shows in app that they will deliver to our location but when we order..they jst cancel saying its more than 10 kms away. i think if they cant deliver than why restayrants are shown as they will deliver..it usef to deliver before but now all delivery guys calls and says they cant deliver to our area..its really dissapointing. many times send this in zomato chat too but they jst say sorry we cnt deliver to ur area,1
worst service ever ! they dont really place ur order with the restaurant If u pay online before receiving the food. they only rush ur order when you have not paid them. the lousy chat agents have no answer and are scammers who just say they tried calling the restaurant but no answer. upon calling the restaurant I was told that there is no order placed under my number. this is ONE hour after I placed my order.Still didnt receive my food and zomato scammers took my momey and refused to return it.,1
"Nice app with best restaurant cover, almost in a week i ordered food 3 times. Experience is awesome . Delivery is also good . Yeah on daily basis zomato has give promocode to his regular customer who often ordered food online. This month is awesome to use TASTY code .",5
Editing this review as the customer service has gone to the dogs. The worst customer service ever. Zomato was the best in customer service but now its chats dont work it asks you to email them and when you email they reply back saying we tried to call you but couldn't reach you. And after that when you reply back saying you did not ger any call from Zomato no reply whatsoever after that. Worst worst worst. What's happening to you guys. From the best to worst. Very dissappointed. Get well soon.,1
"overall it was a good experience with zomato, apart from customer support. there is no option yo call them. Also when trying to chat the executives take way too long to respond. Hence Rating 4 star to this application. Rest Everything is good.",4
"I have ordered something from zomato but forget to change the payment method. Even I cancelled my order within seconds, they deducted the whole amount as cancellation fee , no refund was provided and also the assistant wasn't even in mood of helping me with my issue and they didn't even refund a single penny. Worst costumer care and experience with zomato. Hate this app 😠.",1
"zomato delivery needs to be updated. where people can complain about the order after delivering. Because if there is some incovenience like if i have ordered biriyani and there is no mutton or potato then where do i complain?! totally disappointed with the chat format. and what is the meaning of zomato credit? we don't want zomato credit, we want our money transfered back into our account!",1
"There's no good coupon and the taxes are too damn high. Also, there's some restraunts that doesn'teven provide full and complete menu online. This is a shame. Taxes should be what they take while offline eating and takeout not 100 for 350 purchase. This is ridiculous.",1
I had very bad experience with Zomato i had placed one order by mistake without promo code and i didn't get the option to cancel that order before restaurant confirms it and when i went to cancel that order they said full order amount will be charged and as restaurant has began the food preparatio.. It was prepaid order what the hell it was not more than a minute how they have started preparing my order this is very frustrating,1
"zomato have lowest quality customer care service,their agents delivering wrong orders,when we try to call them they don't recieve,try to chat in app there also waiting for hours,after that somehow they get in touch for this issue,they just say its too late to resolve this issue,you guys are causing troubles and not resolving them in time,pathetic zomato",1
Worst app i have ever seen in my life.... I ordered something but my order was cancelled due to some technical reasons but they deducted money from my paytm account and not returning it after complaining 5 times... Every time i complain they tell me to wait for 48 hours and then nothing happens..... They are theives stop ordering from them....... Worst worst worst app ever... I dont have the option to rate ia zero star else i would have done that,1
"useless customer care.. to chat with then u need to wait for 30 mins to see there hi.... if hotel is not responding they dont care. i have experience this two times and got really frustrated with the service. i have been waiting for my dinner since 2 hours and have still not received. if we chT with zomato chat service.. they simply make you wait for 30 mins atleast and than one word ""SORRY""",1
"Experience is good. but need some improvement on their app. Everytime after delivery food they wants to give rating the food. At least you should give some time to customer to test the food. How a person gives rating to food before having it?? Your App is good, just need some improvements..👍👍",1
i would have tried rating it in minus if given an option. Lately Zomato's service has been getting worst day by day . and when you reach out to them nobody call's you back after this new chat service . and chat service takes hours just to acknowledge and respond.,1
"pathetic services, the staff was very bad, they don't even help you ever...! I have ordered chicken pasta and they have sent me veg pasta and when I have complaint about that they were asking for a image of pasta.... well how you guys will tell us in just checking a image and when I spoke to Shilpa and told her to ask the Restraunt manager about the order, I spoke to him and even had a recording too... he accepted his mistake and told me that his chef has forgot to add chicken in that.",1
"Before the update: ""The most unique food app in the world"". After the update: "" Like any regular food app, lost it shines and unique"" 1.No more food pictures. 2.No more real menu. 3.Much less resturant options sorrounding. 4.No more easy searches. 5.It lost the competitive advantage. currently am using the iphone cuz it still has the old version. once it get updated i will say bye bye to Zomato after many years loyal!",1
Worst food delivery app I have used till date. My order was cancelled by the delivery guy and the cancellation charges we charged. Till date I don't know the reason for imposing the cancellation charges on me. Don't use this app. Use swiggy and Uber eats they are far better.,1
"After 75 minutes of the order, I had to go to live chat and find out that the assigned delivery agent bike got punctured and they cannot do anything. Stupid response. And they are very happy to cancel and refund the order as if my 75 minutes of waiting is nothing for them! Their holy grail solution!",1
"Satisfying, App is very handy and service is normally good with some exceptions which I believe are at vendor end. I have been double charged twice but rectified once it is communicated to Zomato. other delivery services don't have good coverage in our area whereas zomato provides number of choices and good deals",4
U guys should work on your app. I am unable to change my number as the previous one is not in use anymore. I tried everything like reinstall the app and even deleted my account and re-created it still unable to change my number. Even the user interface is ugly. Won't be able to order anymore.,2
A very poor type of behaviour and response towards customer satisfaction. I ordered my food and it automatically cancelled after a waiting of two hours. After the cancellation I asked the zomato care to call me and solve the issue but instead of solving the issue they ping me they can't do anything to it and to order me a new one. Even they didn't make me a refund,1
"Great application. Helps to order varieties food, delivers on time...however a few of the times the packing opens up and the liquids such as shake or buttermilk is all over the packing, if this could be taken care off. But still overall thank you 👍.",5
"So clearly they save themselves by not having a call facility. Either their delivery boys dont bring the orders or just bring wrong order. They dont care about the customer paying and waiting for the food. i dont know how they are working in 24 countries!!! They can barely handle India. Kindly avoid this app, add swiggy instead, at least they have people who'd call and see to your issues",1
Its to much to even give you one star i prefer more less then this. making my my oder too late then i have cancelled it so calling me and telling that we will charge you your this amount in next oder and in future you will not able to do COD and much more. So there are many more app that understand customer problem and allow to cancel as per our convince so please dont tell this all stuffs..,1
"Its a good food delivery app with easy navigation feature. It covers almost all restaurant in the nearby area. Menus are well placed and generally available, provide live tracking of food preparation, delivery in smooth manner. From Cons side Delivery charges are on higher side. Overall Good app for foodies..",3
I am very Disappointed with services. if I cancel my order money can refund after five working days. same issue happens twice. they didn't provide phone number. if I go with the chat it will take at least one hour.,1
"Worst app for food ordering. I ordered twice, both the times the delivery representative called and told their vehicle isnt working, and when I ask for refund, they tell it'll take 3-4 days for that. I recommend you to use swiggy or ubereats. please dont use this useless app.",1
Worst experience I have ordered around 8: 50 pm after 10:30 pm they have informed that order is wrongly placed for self pick up. Due to this worst I have slept without having anything. Lastly local is best don't believe in this type of deceiving apps especially zomato by increasing prices in online. If anybody has doubts regarding prices you can order from prices known restaurants.,1
"Advice, Zomato should notify candidate's who are not called for an interview via using software but only once they manually screen the resume and cv. So, that candidate's don't end up wasting time in-order to respond interview call from Zomato. I think it's the best practice to do this value your prospect candidate because you know -ve WOM spreads faster than +ve WOM impacting brands credibility and deglecting trustworthy image. #advice #nothappy #boostyouremployeeconfidence",3
"Worst customer service ever, they dont have a policy to refund your money if the order doesn't get delivered. The chat people just keep on saying sorry. They never refund which is so frustrating. Swiggy is far better as compared to zomato at least they understand if something happens they refund the money. I am never going to use zomato again. PATHETIC CUSTOMER SERVICE !!",1
"Only Assurances for starting Delivery is given by customer care , if we ask for specific Resturant .....No visible efforts",1
Its the worst app to order food because you can only chat with them only after ordering food and you cant complain about the food or delivery once the food is delivered.Moreover it doesn't have any discounts or offers.No customer helpline numbers too.Swiggy is far far far better than zomato..as it offers discounts and delivery is much better with customer support throughout.,1
poor support. I ordered food and when I received it order was missing so started chat with zomato support but no reply in one hour so my order is still missing. very bad service. They don't even bother to reply back for any query. I have screenshots for chat no reply from them forever,1
It has a good number of restaurants list. But make it a little bit User Friendly. Some options are difficult to find. SUGGESTION: You could keep an eye on those options that are frequently used by people and HIGHLIGHT them on the page.,4
"most of the time the app crashes automatically. and in overall lists even it includes the restaurants that shows ""it is not accepting orders currently"" , we have to check one by one to see all the restaurants that which one is open.",2
Very bad experience about the service... Zomato has no sufficient man power for delivery... And very careless about the customer satisfactory service... I am going to uninstall the application from my mobile.... Advice everybody for not to install this application...if need to order food online then go with any online food service excluding Zomato..... Dont waste your time and money by using Zomato..,1
"If there is any issue, they just have a chat to talk. They dont take responsability for the restaurants if the orders are late! The Worst App. Always had problems with the delivery!",1
I have faced many issue with the delivery many times and today also . I have paid for the order and waited for 30 mins and the order was not delivered to me and when I tried calling delivery boy he said he delivered the order. and there was no option to reach out to the zomato care or the restaurant over the call which made me spent more than 2-3hrs on the waste live chat . the agent was not helping or not even ready to assist when 8 request a call support. I lost my money and time and trust,1
"Amazing service by Zomato...I would like to thank Zomato for refunding instantly for one of the undelivered food by believing the customer(me) without taking time in the name of cross verification which others do...this creates lot of confidence to customers while ordering food online. My issue is really an example of ""if you are honest then you will get fair chance""...Thank u once again team Zomato",5
"Really like the app. I can rely on this whenever I need to find new places and check their menu out. However, updates sometimes are quite delayed. Also, menus are not updated esp with old places. I can see new restaurants but it's not yet added in the app. But overall, this is the best app yet to check places out :)",5
"I have used the app twice and both the times I have had the worst experience possible. No communication is provided from your side and no resolution either. Shame, nothing is less than one star or I would have had rated lesser than one star.",1
"Pathetic app, no discount on food items even if it shows any discount it is just a hoax because once you checkout it will charge you the initial price and not discounted price and on top of that if you want to cancel they won't even cancel the order. Pathetic Policy.",1
"Totally unsatisfied with your customer support service, nobody helping, if i m not getting delivery or delivery is too late, just getting messages in chat options send mail for everything, that is your service..it was rediclus when your support exutive close chat conversation forcefully with resolution..",1
"I use zomato often. But their customer support is rubbish. I caught food poisoning, complained, and got no refund. No surprises considering which part of the world this app is used. Just warning you that if something happens to your health from any food orders, the people behind this app only provide lip service. The worst customer service I have EVER experienced. Normally you would get an apology, a phone call and a refund, but that doesn't exist here.",1
"You can not cancel your order: i did some order and just after 1 min i want called to cancel it. They did not allowed to do same. Initially i applied my coupon then i did some modification in order, then forget to apply coupon again . My 1st,question. Why the applied coupon is remove after modification in order? I will suggest please providing cancelation options atleast till 2-3 min of order... If zomato is not able to provide this facility. Please everybody go for SWIGGY and FOODPANDA. Thanks",1
"Literally bloody!! We all frequently order food from apps. What we expect that the delivered food, the associated restaurants would provide quality food. I ordered couple of paranthas. To mine and my family's horror, a piece of glass was there in the parantha and it pierced my tongue. It was bloody and I was more focussed on getting the glass out and stopping the blood rather on clicking pictures. I asked for ZOMATO'S assistance. It has been 9 days and assistance, next to nothing has been prvd.",1
"Recently bought gold membership on a pre notion delivery charges will be free as I was paying 1800 rs, but it's not free. One of lucrative offer was 1+1 on delivery but 100% vendors are road side cheap quality, inspite of compliant on food quality I have not received a response and support from zomoto team....it's frustrating experience so far..... never going to be gold again.",1
"Its a very convinient app if you like eating out. From fast delivery services, to reserving a seat in any restaurant in the city and to explore new places, new drinks and new dishes, this app has it all.",5
Pathetic service...once you paid the online bill they make excuses location distance and eat up your whole money without any corporation..no refunds even if you ready to collect at the place!! disagree..no customer service only called and made excuses like the police is that if you paid online payment they can eat your cake and 💰... rediculos pathetic frauds ...,1
"Very bad service support. Do not respond for 4 to 5 days, even on emails. Never make one advance payment, otherwise you will be in trouble. Always make COD, and that too after checking the item .",1
"I would describe experience if they let me have one. Every 3 months they change the app UI. it's frustrating. Let us get used to one thing and improve that, not overhaul ur designs It's painful to learn an app u have been using for 3-4 yrs again and again",2
"Please make sure the restaurants in your stable are keeping to the time suggested b them, sometimes the quality of the food is also not upto the mark",5
"I am facing a problem after so many years on zomato. My regular credit card which I used so many times, expired a few days ago and the Bank sent me a new card with the same no with a new validity fate and new cvv as ia the normal process. The Zomato app is not accepting the card no saying it is invalid !!! Please fix this problem with the app.",5
whenever i am not able to cook after my work Zomato helps me to order food and reach home on time ... also my son at times asks for certain dishes which i cannot cook immediately and i turn up ordering in Zomato birthday parties was harder asi have to go wait for a cake m order and get back now Zomato helps me to sit at home and order with what ever i need. employee s are also polite and friendly were on time service alwways. i recommend zomato boldly when ever any occassion or any need.,5
i can't see my zomato level. please solve,3
"Worst delivery experience...ordered food from subway through the app and more then 1.5 hours passed no delivery despite store being 1 km away and subway store were not responsive and when inquired about the same they said we don't have the item ordered but could send something else to which agreed but the other item was also not delivered , not expected this from zomato and subway...would definitely escalate the matter to consumer forum...store sector 8 subway chandigarh finally received coldsub",1
Very useful app for food products,5
Such yeah woderfull delivery app and company,5
"This app is not at all helpful. Im gonna unintall zomato now. Ordered food but the delivery guys called me to tell, there's no enough petrol sp he can't make the delivery, my husband ahould come where he wanted to stay amd collect from him. Also his apartment was only 1km away. How can they be so careless? Then they called me and told me to cancel the order as the delivery guy was in no mood to deliver. I did not but they rejected my order. Its been a week now amd still I did not get my refund.",1
"Fast response of their email support. Best app if you want to check the reviews of the restaurant first. i just hope I can see again how many viewed my reviews. Since the last update, you can no longer see how many people read yoir reviews. It is somehow motivation seeing the numbers of yoir viewers.",4
Good on time delivery 👍👌 thank,5
"Gr8 offers and customer service Zomato is offering great food at a very reasonable price , plus the discounts are round the clock. Their customer service is very good , even in case of slight delay , they call the customer and do follow ups !!!",5
bad navigation...most of the time the delivery executive is lost because of the wrong path shown in the map...kindly correct it...and yes I am giving the correct location because sometimes the delivery executive comes directly and many a times the guy is lost completely...please try to be competitive and improve your tech,1
Been using it for 2 years & Always encounter with an silly issues which never get solved & customer care Support are worst so are the delivery agent's who demand 5 starts!!! Item missing or incorrect the refund will never be done at any cost..!!! Worst FOOD APP!!!,1
"very poor service.. vry patetic...please don't use this aap. I have ordered a dish from Faasos restaurant through this application, they have accepted my order and payment around 08:30pm and messaged me that ""you will get your order by 09:30pm"" but they are failed to do that after 10:00pm I have cancelled my order..around 11:30pm one of the restaurant guy has reched my door step and he rung the calling bell but we are alredy slept, then he called me on the mobile. He spoiled my dinner and sleep.",1
Extreme policy changes on Gold Membership and limiting to very few restaurants to order from. No more the way it was advertised and promised before purchasing the gold membership. Making fool out of people. Horrible charges in the name of delivery and taxes. Never recommend this stupid app.,1
"App & Service is very good but some reastaurant & delivery boy are not honest with their work. I ordered to HASAN DHABA on 29.06.19 delivery boy took my order and he delivered the order on app but i do not receive any order and he don't pick my phone, after that i did my same order 2 HASAN DHABA and i accept my with in 20 min but my amount of rs 122.60 is not refunded to me. I do 2 to 3 order per day. I want to say some thing about COUSTOMER CARE OF ZOMATO they r not able to solve t problem",1
"App is really good for late night eaters, especially who gets bored to going to restaurants and wait till seat be available!! Through this app im also getting great discounts on some expensive restaurant which i cannot afford easily! But still having issues regarding order cancellation!!",5
not much satisfied,3
"Very bad service . I recieved butterscotch icecream which price was 180 but what i ordered was cookies and cream ice cream of ₹ 200 . And the shop owner is saying that we are sorry for the trouble but we can't do anything you should talk to Zomato . And when i went there for help they aren't responding , they are like thank you for your suggestions , we are sorry for the fault but we can't help you . There were guest in my house for whoom i orderd this and how can i give them that cheap thing😠.",1
worst ever experience. I ordered something which is not delivered to me but in app it was displayed as delivered. And I contacted with customer support they were also not helpful. Not even refunded my money. Swiggy and Uber eats are far better than zomato. i want to 0 star rating but I don't have that option.,1
Pathetic service ever...will never use it again in my life....The restaurant called me that item is not available and asked me to cancel the order and when I opened the app for cancelling it says if you cancel the order your money will not be refunded...I will do a negative publicity for this app on Facebook and my insta page..promise you cheaters...moving to swiggy and uber eats..bye bye,1
The service is very good. Quality and quantity of food is satisfying. But one thing is that sometimes the packaging is good but sometimes it is not satisfactory at all. Overall a nice experience and prices are attractive too.,5
"Pizza packaging was messed up after almost half an hour delay in delivery. Support guys for zomato are even more horrible and ignorant, they only do chatting and don't come up on phone.",1
SUPER SUCKY APP. We bought zomato gold. The app doesn't determine your location properly. Doesn't load app during dinner time or lunch time. They'll just get your money and don't even bother fixing all the bugs and glitches in their app.,1
very poor. They have arbitrary charging rates. Also there are delivery charges and is not a free service. Also the total price is not displayed transparently before the order is placed. You get to know the total amount only after payment.,2
"This has become the worst app now, every time i order something, the delivery boy will call from some random place saying i have reached the location.. And the customer support will cancel the order without my permission, and they wont refund my amount tooo.. This is happening again and again",1
"Useless App.You can't track your order anymore. I was expecting improvements after revamp of the App and that delivery boy eating food of customer fiasco. But t my disappointment, still these zomato guys don't have any control on anything. They simply fool the customer or may be Zomato is fooled by Restuarant partners by substandard food and substandard service.",1
"Registered for the account, purchased the pro membership without problem, but once i wanted to use the benefit, they told me i have to register my number. Tried the OTP verification to no avail, tried up to 3 different numbers, nothing. Try again the next day, still nothing. Reinstalled the app, still failed. Emailed the zomato, only automated response, been more than 2 weeks and still no response. Hi dev, i have emailed you 3 times including yesterday right after i submitted this review.",1
"worst customer support and mail support..unkowingly I ordered a wrong food and within a minute I cancelled my order and explained the issue with chat support,they assured me that next 48hrs the 100% of amount will be refunded..After next 48hrs I got a mail saying according to new cancellation policy ur refund process is Declined.",1
Worst app... worst customer service... Uber is much better.... Today i ordered from burger king and i there was things missing when i contacted the customer care services they said they'll refund the amount of 247 actual price of the wings bucket was 279 . I told him to check the bill properly and refund but he is ignoring all these and telling h'll refund what he like...,1
The app is unintuitive. There are better interfaces than this. The tracking status is an absolute mess. Don't actively track your order. Besides the rating for the delivery guy doesn't really pop up. SWIGGY IS FAR BETTER,2
"I had a very bad experience with Zomato. The services are very poor. When we contact to customer care, they are unresponsive. Some time the order was not delivered but in app showing order has been delivered.",3
"I have always loved zomato's Rating, infact for past 2-3yrs, i never leave for a food joint till i see it's Rating because i know they are unfiltered. I was hoping that they will improve their home delivery service, But now that Zomato has reworked and came with a bang on its home delivery, i have removed uber eats and swiggy from my phone. I have used all products of zomato now I guess and hope to continue the trend",5
Okay choices are less/more depends comparing others apps for online ordering but hey comparatively cheaper and I could order from my local restaurant cheaply and yeah there were discounts which made them worthwhile and food would be delivered sooner than expected which I liked about Zomato compared to others apps bottom line I really loved the app and was looking for it glad I found it,5
I understand they are dealing with multiple restaurants and food outlet. But the problem is they don't listen to customers. Whenever I complain Abt quality or any other issue.. They regret.. But does nothing.. They confirm that they will take action against the food outlet. But God knows what action they take. The response of the support staff is useless and I really fed up with Zomato now.. As a customer I need the proper response and ownership from Zomato but they only regret for inconvenience,1
Online deliveries and prompt service Thank you,5
"excellent concept, now I can have food from my favorite restaurant at my home. but must have some communication medium. I got 2 time my brevearges missing from my order and rider and restaurant owner both blamed each other for this. and there was nothing to communicate with zomato.",3
"App Good but service,food packaging like such, as A beggar has been put in a polythene bag.i have click few pic. Service time approx 25min. But delivered after 45min. Call 5time Thanks Again This is my third or last order... Check ur ground and improve service ... First 2 orders service R so good but.........3",2
I am annoyed by seeing your adds again and again on you tube videos and you show same add again that irritates me more 😏😒😜,1
"Zero stars!!! Worst app ever! Detects the wrong location whenever there is a prepaid delivery. Even when i manually input the address, the food is sent to some different address which is kilometers away from mine. Idk if this the apps fault or if the company is doing this on purpose!",1
"Service is good and quick. The only issue is in my Location I always don't get delivery. It shows that delivery isn't available for your Address, and I cannot customize my address manually.",4
The experience was very good the delivery was a bit late but one thing to be appriciated that ther is contact less delivery and the person getting the food is polite and the app is very my experience says that everyone should try the app once if ur odering the food and for pepole of zomato just look at the timming of the dilevery otherwise thing like sanitizing and all keep going and keep it up,5
Order ran very late and the reason was given as restaurant delayed the order. Quite unprofessional and letting customer down. No option to cancel delivery because apparently the order was prepared. If it was prepared then what is taking it half an hour to reach a distance of 10 minutes.,1
Very bad experience .....order was placed andthey said they will deliver . But later they said they don't have the pass which they should have known earlier . The order should not have been accepted . Unprofessional behaviour. This has happened to me the third time .,1
"Such a bad experience everytime, refunds will not be done , restaurant will accept the order food will be prepared even then order will be cancelled ,very frastuated with Zomato ,such irresponsible agents on chat even when you're on chat they will close the chat,only thing Zomato is good at (Is there anything else we are always there to help you) .",2
I want my money back. I ordered food from your app. After completing the payment I got a call from restorant he said my area is out of service so they could not process my order. So refund my money as early as possible I also mail your mail I'd but I can't get any response....,2
Recently the app has been crashing a lot. In each an every step for online ordering I'm getting the message 'Sorry something went wrong. Try again later'. It has become very annoying to order food via this app,2
"The food was delivered on time. But because of my address they had almost cancelled my order without any refund. I had to convince them for delivery. If food is not delivered for any reason, at least the money should be refunded.",4
everytime I update this app it keeps on getting bad to worse. Seconds ago I wanted to order a food from a particular restaurant but I thought of updating the app first so I updated the app now after this update it says the restaurant is not accepting order. please fix it.,1
"I have been using Zomato since years now and I think this is by far the best food delivery app. Customer service is very fast. Everytime my order has been messed up, I have got full refund for everything. Sometimes you can face issues but you can't expect 100% service from any app. I love Zomato",5
"badest customer service, really sometimes do as they want to..... two orders placed due to their less efficiency in confirming the order and couldn't help now.....have to eat food twice as it cant be wasted but what if as completely thier way of understanding customer is waste ....kindly reach up and ask what exactly happened because as for now no one wish to listen or care....and do get rid of ur cheesy no against customer policy....in the support chat....pls understand the concern and ur fault",2
why there is not an option to give no star. Zomato are bunch of thiefs I ordered food from one of the restaurant from Zomato app and clicked on cash on delivery by mistake as discount is only applicable on online payment. I tried to cancel the order within a minute but they refused and i even asked the delivery guy to cancel the order. But they charge penalty on me of 395 for making this mistake. hopeless service of Zomato they just lose one of there oldest customer,1
the food quality is good but the people who are delivering the food they are not very much intelligent and cannot understand the address perfectly .we very much tired to explain where is our home but he was too much week to understand it. please cure their mind and them for this.,2
"Zomato bought Urbanspoon and eliminated the random restaurant feature. It's been a few years since then, but the elimation of this feature still makes me feel a way. I cannot (and will never) truly enjoy the app that eliminated this feature. If Zomato brings this feature back I will consider changing my rating.",1
"The customer support tests your patience to the core. you cannot call them and when you really need to get help, you cannot get through the chat...waiting time NEVER ends. There cannot be a good rating to an organization which is into services and has such useless customer support.",2
always on time!,5
Very bad app it is totally disappointing using this app ... I ordered my meal but i didn't received it and the delivery boy is also not responding and not receiving my phone ..i didn't not received my meal but i received a massage of food has being delivered to me...its was totally unexpected for me ...i have made my payment online but i didn't received my refund ...i don't know why you all have fone that ...but its was totally unexpectable ...and the chat that is given for queries that i also not replying ...for me it is totally a fake app ..i have face this problem twice in zomato ..****,1
very disappointed with Zomato services. Registered restorent doing frauds and Zomato not able to take any action against them. With me and with my friends lots of times happened that food not delivered and delivery boy wrote comments that address not found. it is just not acceptable so many times. Go for swiggy at least food will get delivered.,1
"This is a very useless app because of which I did not even get my last-minute order.These people do not offer good service and Even restaurants hired by these people do not take the responsibilities of this people, as well as the helpline center, they neither listen to you nor reverse blim, neither do they hired by the restaurant delivery boys also say that If the food gets cold till you order it, then we can not do anything for it. and im paying everytime money for this bad serivce.",1
"Worst app for food order, your food gets totally mashed up when it reaches you. And when you go to chat support they just keep on saying we're trying to sort out the problem and does nothing no repone from them. Don't waste your money on this app🙏",1
"I have gold membership, I placed my order from Momoz, Brookfield, and after a wait of 1 hour and 10 mins I got a message that my order could not be delivered due to some internal issue. I tried to take help from the chat option (Executive Name: Poornima) but she was also of no use to me. She directly told me that she can't do anything.",1
Customer support is very poor in zomato as many of the times you get the different dish from the one you have ordered and customer care would only say that we have confirmed from restaurant order was rightly dilevered though you have proof for getting another dish . Also No instant solution you have to email them and have to wait for their reply while waiting for about 2 days . Swiggy service is much much better.,1
"The worst food delivery app ever. they are a big time scam. I had ordered for 2 items from a resturant and when the order came home i realised they had debited my accounted twice and giving a double order. i approched the customer service through zomato chat,which is supposed to be helpful but sorry to say they couldnt help or understand what i was to say!! over which they there was delay in delivery as well ad responding on chats. Sorry to say that you guys have the worst customer service Ever",1
I normally use Uber eats since zomato has acquired the business it has not only hiked the prices but also not caring customer values. Their customer executive is as well not at all useful as they say order will be arrived in 15 min. When I ping them after 15min they again say 15 min like almost 40-50min time has been taken in delivering the food.Such a bizzare experience it was,1
"Everything about placing the order till checkout is very smooth and intuitive but when it comes to booking/exploring restaurants, navigation is very weird something. Specifically the search functionality is confusing. its a 4 for that reason.",4
"The app is complete and good, but everytime I want to view the menu of every restaurant, the app crashes and closes. It is very inconvenient. Please have it fixed. I can never look at the menu anymore because of this.",3
"poor customer service.. I tried reaching your customer care number multiple times, but no one picks the call.. even in chat window no conclusion, Zomato charges 3 times more than actual price of food item, this we have personally experienced. They are trying to fool customer and also loose trust among its customers.",1
My order didn't deliver 2 hours after ordering and got to know that the order got stolen by the delivery man.,1
"The after sales service is pathetic. Even after overpricing the items, when the food delivered by them turns out to be stale/non-edible/health hazard, they are not able to refund you the charges. Their customer support representatives would turn out rude and unprofessional if you would attempt to escalate such malpractices. I would rather recommend others to use UberEats or Swiggy or other Food Delivery Service. Oh Boy, i am zomato customer for more than 5 years with monthly transaction<INR3000",1
Excellent food delivery app,5
"Chat with us or support is not opening at all. I had to open the website on laptop to file a complaint about my order, I sent my order Id and transaction Id, got no reply about refund or what's next. This happened for the second time where restaurant sent msg they are refunding the amount but none was credited",1
I used to like this app but the past few experiences have been awful. The food as well as the delivery time were poor. The delivery shouldnt be a 1.5 hr long wait and then the food was really bad too. I somt think i will be using it again.,1
"Fake, Fraudsters and the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! I placed an order, first it confirmed and then 25 mins LATER it got automatically cancelled. Then I placed order from another restaurant, it got placed successfully BUT NO TRACKING INFORMATION was shown and after 1.5 hours I get a message that my order is on the way! It never got delivered and they charged me for it. I used the chat option to raise this concern but NO ONE RESPONDED for hours. This all happened late at 1am in the night.",1
"After deducting amount for my order they take atleast one to two hour for delivery, as no fault of Delivery guy as the management is pressuring for multi delivery and if you are not lucky as I then you have to wait for your food for long long time. If still same happen again with me then I will uninstall zomato and also not refer to anyone.",1
"Worst service. I placed my order on zomato then due to some urgency I have to cancel it. I cancelled it within 3-4 min then on their chat they wrote that as the phone was not reachable therefore the order had been cancelled and also refund would not be placed and the whole amount will be levied as cancellation charge. One of the employee also told that after deduction of little cancellation charge about 20 to 30 rupees, the amount will be refunded but it is not so. I Didn't receive the food, didn't receive the refund, what I receive was an email telling they will reply at the earliest. Never go for online payment on zomato. Worst service from zomato. Really disappointed. 😠😠😠",1
"They have plenty of restaurants delivering, offers and reviews. Even thoguh all thay seem to be helpful, their customer service and the way they handle issues is probably the worst. They clearly do not know how to handle operations and at most time seems to be very confused, including the managers that manage the customer service team.",1
"Zomato app has been consistently improving their look, performance and real time tracking. But there are still some opportunities on the display of the application. Hope the team will make better user interface.",5
"Worst customer support... First thing.. They can cancel order at any point of time while if the customer cancel the order even immediately after ordering they don't refund..its totally cheating. Second thing... Any item kept in the cart can be automatically processed and the money will be deducted automatically. Third thing... Never ever link any of your payment mode like credit card details, paytm etc Fourth thing... No support executive will be provided. Fraudlant at its peak.",1
Iam happy to use zomato I loved it but yesterday I got an issue and I raised a query but still I didn't get any response from zomato so I felt that other apps like swiggy Uber were far better than zomato in customer service . I mailed them 2 times with some pics regarding issue still I didn't get any response so I thought it's better to use another application which gives you quick response,1
"AWESOME app , a lifesaver off course for a hungry soul, good service, overall a 5 pointer app. But dear ZOMATO, please make sure that some restaurants delivers spoiled foods and they don't take hygiene as an important factor as it is ordered from zomato. I don't know what's in their mind about zomato so please make them clear that if they can't provide quality foods likely to their reputation then not to collab with zomato. Thankyou✌️",5
Pathetic service and support even worse. Ordered food and waited for long just to see that order was cancelled as vallet could not connect to me. Though my phone number was reachable all that time and i myself called him as soon as order status changed but it wasn't of any help Support guys are of no help either.,1
"I have not liked the experience, the delivery ppl are not having any etiquette, they just shout on call or reaching home if they are delivering. They should be in well etiquette as they are not paying us we are paying them. Half of the meal is missing when order reaches.",1
very good Idea. In one hand people are able to get their favorite food from their favorite restaurants just in some clicks. And in an other hand a group of people get employment through this Idea. all the best. ☺,5
"After the shear dissapointment I would rate 1/10 due to horrible past experience. There was a huge communication gap and I was passed on the wrong details due to which my 350 bucks was wasted. On registering the complaint over email, the executives showed shear escapism as he wasn't bothered about the problem but was more focused closing the query asap and made a biased outcome in the favor of the restaurant. Such a greedy and money-minded service provider who is least bothered ab8 the customer",1
worst ever app i have used. the delivery executives are rude.not ready to listen.i order from fresh menu and imagine till 1 hour the restaurant did not connect. you could not track delivery agent like swiggy has map. not even u will get the delievery executive number.they will call u from company number.and if they disconnect you cannot connect him through that mobile no. pls shut down ur worst shop. i could not able to cancel the order waited for 2 hours no one delived the food.fraud com0any,1
"They neither provide delivery person details not give any information by support chat..and delivery person without calling cancelled order with reason that I didn't receive call. I have been trying to connect on customer care and they didn't inform anything, moreover they tell lie. Spoiled our weekend , we waited for one hr, neither we could get contact number of delivery person,not the restaurant picked up phone . Don't go with this.",1
"Very Good offers and services...one thing needs improvement, you need to show only list of restaurants which can deliver as per location, as of now i need to go to restaurant and need to check, will provide delivery or not.",4
"Worst food delivery app ever! I ordered food, waited for 1hr and suddenly it shows that my order has been delivered! When I call the delivery guy he keeps saying that he has delivered it to me when i never got my order!! Later it turns out that he had delivered my oder to some other person. I don't get how this kind of irresponsibility is possible for food delivery app! Just unacceptable.",1
The only useful feature is to look up for places and zomato gold. They do not have any control on delivery time even with their own driver. if you are okay to wait for more than an hour for delivery use zomato. if you want a quick delivery use UberEats.,2
worst place to visit. they just want to make as much as money cheating the local Hyderabad customers,1
"Cheaper than Swiggy Super with offers, experience is much better now. I have payed for Swiggy Super but find ZOMATO more value for money wrt charges right now Negative 2stars cause restaurants are supposed to cut profit for such delivery tie ups which get them more orders ie we don't dine in but here Zomato let's restaurant charge that 30% extra on customers on top of which they add delivery charges. Its daylight Robery in the name of delivery.",3
Poor quality service. We have to wait 60minutes before someone noticed us and the restaurant was practically empty at that time.the food was medicore too. Never recommending this to anybody.and the packing of the food is too bad the food came out of the packed cover is the service you are providing good never use zomato,1
"What is there with the new terms and condition zomato applied ?... I bought gold subscription as well as my friend bought it too , cause i insisted . New policies are rubbish i want a refund or bring back the old policies or a better alternative is to apply new policies for new subscribers not for the old subscribers . Thank you",1
They should have an order cancellation policy. They should probably give us like a 2-5 minute window and allow us to cancel an order or even at a cancellation fee. It gets really difficult sometimes.,3
"It was good experience but only one complaint against Chai point they deliver different thing what we have ordered. I placed an order for 5 cups of tea they delivered only one fup of tea, and I am vegetarian and placed an order for Veg Puff but Chai Point delivered Egg puff which is disappointing.",4
the app is good. just needs more tweak on which restaurants are not taking orders during currently not accepting orders instead of being them closed. and even show all the other menu the restaurant gives even if it is not being sold at that moment so that we can see the full menu in all restaurants. rating the food per dish or even reviewing per dish could be good to know like descrpitive one maybe available only to certain rank holders kind of to make it less messy.,4
"Simple yet very intuitive interface. All information needed for the customer is available. Haasle free no nonsnse UX from exploration to payment to delivery. However, the best part is the discounts. Swiggy Sucks and we know it! Hail Zomato.",5
"Zomato works well only till the restaurants don't screw up. I spent 75 bucks, got stale food and got a discount of 53 on next order. Couldn't even find a way to talk to or chat with someone. My next order will be of 50 bucks and then I'll stop ordering from zomato. No credits to your 'coupon do, wapas aayega' tactic.",1
"I am totally disappointed with the the restaurant (White hart pizza) and zomato even. Orderer Pizza combo but unfortunately the cream which was used was smelling like they used old cream in making that. When I complained about it and claimed for replacement or refund, zomato refused it saying thay need to verify from restaurat. Even I was saying to take the order from me and check if own but they did not help me. Really very very disappointed. 🙁🙁",2
Biggest fraud app. These people have the worst customer service and even if the mistake is from there end they are helpless. Fraud people... They make their code valid at any time and even if the validity of the promo code has not ended they make the code unvalid and show no concern to it. Just trapping people for their self use of data leak.,1
"No support available. I ordered foods from one resturant and one item was missing. I reached to support through mail and chat support with order id, but no reply from zomato yet. I hate this app because zomato does not provide any support. The rates of the foods are excess. So better install swiggy.",1
"poor service or untrained staff i would rate zero if possible or definitely recommend to not use this App.they do not refund back so be careful. Hunget is no more a worry as long as this App is working however d location although clearly saved, bt the restaurant or delivery boy often calls and ask for location to be shared by WhatsApp.",1
what started off as a great food delivery service is slowly and steadily heading for the drains. wrong food gets delivered. then made to wait for 18straight minutes to get any cuatomer support to resolve the issue( while constantly staing 1minute wait time). Very disappointed with the drastic drop in service quality.,2
"Worst service! My account was blocked saying there has been so many cancellations though I hv hardly cancelled any of my order. The same thing happened with one of my friends' account who has hardly placed an order as he was living in UK. So, obviously they are blocking Zomato accounts for no reason and they say that they cannot reactivate the account for online ordering. Why are you running the business then? Better close it off. Very bad experience!",1
"one star now from previous two stars, can't even chat with CC of zomato Going through the worst ever experience in pune and though i always ask for proper packaging in plastic containers and cutlery but most of the time you have to throw away the order as no one in zomato thinks that how a person who is ordering daily will eat from the polythenes, really shameful service so i prefer swiggy now, i had no complaints in kolkata ordering for 8 months but here it is the worst service i have ever seen",1
Had the worst experience ever.. don't go for this app if you don't want to lose your money. I ordered a cake for my friend and they were not able to deliver the cake and i was fully charged for the order.. the worst service ever.. absolute not recommended.,1
Swiggy is 1000 X more professional than zomato. When ever i have an issue zomato never responds. Just keeps me on the chat and says we will respond soon. After a while they say sorry for the inconvenience if you still have a problem stay on the chat. And continue this on a loop. USE SWIGGY Guyz much better service and customer value.,1
"Auto chat is a funny process these guys follows. Ordered 2 items worth 700. One of the item worth 325 was completely stale and stinking ( could not even keep it in the room ), raised a complaint and they refund 24 bucks without even letting me to talk to anyone and continued with their auto replys on chat. Funny Thing.",1
"Bad service, not acceptable. order has not reached in the intimated time and it has passed nearly 30 mins trying to reach an agent to address the issue. no reply from zomato nor the restaurant. if this is the way things work no point in ordering online, I could go and pick it up myself",1
"I've been an active reviewer for years already, and I feel like this apps is getting better. They now offer Zomato Gold membership, reservation via apps, promotional info, etc. I actually prefer them to have the timeline to read reviews written by people who I follow. That feature help me to keep me updated.",5
"I am starting to miss Ubereats due to non availability of online orders with many of my favorite hotels almost all the time. 1 pm imperio is not open for orders. What am I missing? Also late night orders are very very limited. Time to switch to an alternative, unfortunately not many choices available",1
Useless service very bad customer support,1
pathetic. utterly poor customer support. i order a dish from the restaurant and they confirmed that due to high inflow they can not fullfill the order . it would take them atleast 2 hrs. they zomato is not accepting cancellation. they dumm ass is trying to tell me that its wastage of food. on the contrary they have still ni not started preparing the dish at the location.,1
"Great app but its maps could be improved further. If a default instruction can be added to call the customer then it'd be great. My location does not show properly on the map, so if I don't call the valet myself they go to the map location and then call me. It wastes my time and theirs.",4
useless app only to loot people that's it. The delivery man cancel the order and when I am saying to refund my money they are saying refund is not applicable. They are just running a fraud business. And make different types of policies like if the restaurant will cancel your order after accepting it that is fine but we can't cancel our order if restaurant accept it. What type of policy this is?,1
the worst app ever I have seen I'm waiting for food from last 45 min and its not yet arrived.. when call to the delivery boy said that map is showing some different address when called to customer care it was showing my correct address but still she cancelled the order I was remain hungry at the end .. worst customer support team order was prepaid n she said look out by your own to get your money back..,1
"Good food delivery app but some getting food from some restuarants especially subbaya,krithiga,mehfil in Hyderabad",4
I have used this app only a couple of times and today when I ordered a cake it was spoiled and there is no proper customer after sale services. I couldn't talk to their representatives and the chat just ended automatically by giving me an coupon that is not even worth.,1
"Worst experience. Forget delivery, my food was stale and half eaten.",1
"Overpriced items and no customer service No control over restaurants, useless items delivered at high price. No proper customer support. Just focused on getting extra money. In Chandigarh anyone can get 30 eggs(full tray) at 120-140 rs and their restaurants are delivering 2 boiled eggs at 99+tax. No check on pricing of the food items.",1
Incorrect real time display.,1
useless. .. i was suppose to get my order delivered in 40 mins... but i get my order in 1 hour 10 mins... also i contacted chat suport with wait time showing as 8 mins but got connected after 1 hour that too advisor closed chat as resòlved. food was cold and delivery guys said was stuck with some issue.,1
"3rd class service, used to be great once. Orders are routinely late (3rd consecutive late today), helplines offer no real help except call service, no recompense for significantly delayed orders. Often chat help doesn't respond. Leave this goddamn app, talabat / deliveroo offering much better service overall honestly",1
"I'm a regular customer, and I was happy with the service. But once I ordered and had to cancel it, as the delivery was taking time, but only the money for the food was refunded, and not the tax and delivery charges !",5
Very good service,5
If you have a lot of money to waste and not interest to eat but want to order the food defenetly this is the best app and serviece for that. There is no door delivery they will call us and will tell to receive tge package from the street ending and then we have to go and bring the package. Thata it. I cant explain any morw.,1
"Really horrible service. When the food gets delivered late, all thay say is "" sorry "" without refunded the amount paid. If you ok with late and clld Food and just get a SORRY download this crappy app. Swiggy and Uber Eats has way better customer service and cheaper and better food.",1
App is very good. Have some issues like we order from restaurants and while the time of payment the message will come this restaurant stopped taking online orders.. Then we have to do it again from other restaurants. This keep repeating.. If they are not taking orders why you are listing there names,3
Its easy to access ..and really helpful. I love using it. Specially when i am at office and it becomes really hard to go somewhere to buy food. I can always order online and the food arrives in v.less time right infront of me.,5
Very bad experience for this . previously I'm using uber eats app which is too user friendly and easy to find out shops and dishes.. but in zomata very worst ui like traffic jam.. user wants oly menus and shop name and location but this zomata initially you guys provide shop stories !! After click go online then oly menu items visible..who asked a shop owners astrologies!!!.. hope ur using very latest android technologies in this app but make it easy as per enduser perspective...,1
Very bad interface with the customer care,1
worst experience with them... ordered food online at night many times and never reached on time always minimum 30 mins late and one day the valet switched off his phone and took my order along with him can you believe the quality of valet they are having. I would rather go for Swiggy or Foodpanda they are much better and do not make any such false promises. uninstalled the app worst experience,1
"whenever i have ordered the food it takes long time showing confirming order. And at last it got cancelled. It really makes me too angry, as if you have consumed so much of my time just to say sorry we are unable to place your order.",1
Not taking care of orders...just giving customize question and answer from the server...just saying sorry all finished not giving any wrting option to the customer on chat service...if i want to complain then also they are giving same option again and again......firstly zomato chat service was good now very very poor service.....,1
"I was suppose to get call or message from zomato agent ,I had complaint about the food quality and they said u will receive the revert in 24hrs and now it's more than 72hrs no revert order was placed on 2september,. What a horrible service Zomato gives ,I think Zomato is a fraud company who's just know to take money for bad quality food and i am sure they have a tie ups with the hotel who serves 2-3 days back food ,I think Zomato is getting good amount of money from this kind of hotels",1
It was very bad experience. I ordered food from the website it did not ask me for location pinning and I wrote my address in the address section. Then I am told that my pinned location is different from the address. They cancelled my order and didn't refund me.,1
"Worst app ever. I ordered food amounting rs 800, I paid the amount through online mode, but the order was not at all delivered, the delivery boy was very rude and refused to deliver the order, and the zomato support team is useless too. I suggest you all to not install or use this app. Worst Experience!",1
It is truly pain in the ass I accidentally hit the order button but when I tried to cancel my order there was no option and they said once order placed can't be cancelled even I tried to cancel it immediately then I called the restaurant and they said they haven't started my order yet but still zomato replies in your next order you have to pay the amount of the bill as the cancellation charge plus the zomato new code is very tricky because In my 2nd order i forgot to apply it I lost d code,2
Correct time delivery,4
Zomato app and service both very bad Because they will not try to solve my problems regarding online delivery of food by COD. Zomato will Hide/Off my COD option so i cant order food online. Its create problem to me for placing order online. Now present days I will use only Swiggy app because they give me COD service for order food. Swiggy will solve my every query and problems immediately on chat and give me COD service also. Zomato services are very bad and poor.,1
"I ordered 2 double egg cheese chicken rolls, one double egg cheese prawn roll and chicken pakoda from ""Food King"",Cuttack. There was neither chicken nor cheese in the rolls. And the prawn roll just had 3 small prawns in it. The chicken pakoda pieces were very tiny and bony. I took pictures and shared my bad experience to the zomato support. I expected some sort of compensation but all I got was a thank you. Please don't support fraudulent food outlets and please don't loose humble customers.",1
very bad app. it shows you discount in the menu and then adds the original price to be paid while checking out for payment. i was charged wrongly by them for the same. they don't even compensate for the same. bloody bastards,1
"today was my first order but as soon i put first usrr coupen i couldn't get the service. reason my simple in cod coupen are not valid. is this way you deal with new user with hidden policy but good customer service, they are humble and nice way to convey message. I dislike the zomata policy but appreciate customer support and food. thkxz",2
"As long as you dont have any concerns or questions or need any help on your order, this app works great. Their customerservice is BAD. Their customercare execs are helpless with standard replies like ' this will not happen again', 'we will make a note', ' we wont be able to help you'.",3
"Shows the minutes away, but actually doesn't keep track of the minutes away. Modifies accordingly to make it appear as if the order was before time. Happened multiple number of times.",1
Very fast and to good app,5
Worst Service ever.... Especially the customer support guys and some restaurants whose numbers are unreachable even after trying them for 8-10 times,1
Following issues with restaurants and Zomato is never able to resolve them. They feel the best way to resolve is just give you 10 aed as token of apology on an order placed for aed 50.. that's ridiculous 1) Most of the times food is delayed. 2) Wrong order by restaurants. 3) not taking care about food allergies even after informing,2
Order never delivered but still shows delivered on application. Even wasted so much time while keeping track of the order as everytime i called the restaurant they said Zomato delivery person has not arrived to pick up the order. Worst experience and not the first time too.,1
"Very bad customer service. Their exact words are "" Sorry we are not accountable for the quality of food you receive. If you have got stale food or tasteless food, we can't help you. Sorry it wont happen next time"" But this happens everytime",1
The new update is so irritating. Meals for one doesn't have the cuisines and veg-non veg option. Now it is a huge trouble to find everything. It lacks +4 rating button as well. New update is yucks for me. Won't use this app anymore. Takes a lot of time to order now.,3
App needs some improvements. There is only chat option for customer service and no call option. This any a times take hell lot of time for the issue to get resolved. And even the customer service agents are rude. Need lot of improvement in customer service. Discounts are great in comparision to others.,3
Really bad delivery service and what's worse is there customer service. Zomato has No Customer Care No. You have chat with them to solve the issue which takes atleast an hour to chat with them. And on top of that they are not even sorry for not delivering the order at all....zomato used to be good but now it is the worst in the business Other apps are much better,1
Best for order,5
"Discounts are too less as compared to other partners.. My Uber eats was always better. Hefty delivery charges with Tax extra, pathetic.. For 200 Rs of food, i ended up paying 50 more, were the hell is discount? Zomato gold at times end up charging more money than regular discounts. U cannot fool people for more time.. Swiggy will take over your venture shortly..keep watching!",2
Bad experience always..after the amazing success of the delivery boy eating the food himself Zomato still hasnt improved on its services..right now i ve been waiting for more than half an hour at night just for the confirmation of the my order...and in the end what i get to know is order not accepted..the other apps are better at least they responded with a no quickly...,1
Worst Service!! This is the first time i am writing a review for any app i have ever used. And believe me they forced me to do so. My order was automatically cancelled as soon as i placed it. My money was deducted and on contacting customer care the said drop us an email. Which i did. Now since then every time i ask them for the status they say the same drom us and email. And you know what i have not received any emails back from them. Are you kidding zomato? Cannot you resolve a simple issue?,1
"Initially it was a 5 * app, but now it became more and more pathetic in terms of customer care. And 1 big problem is ,prices are way high than original for ex if something is spelled for 60 rs, on Zomato it shows 99 and on top of that other service charges added. So even if you use 40 % discount coupon code, you still paying way more.",2
I am rating it so less just because of its high prices and super slow delivery today only I was not able to see the tracking time less than 15 minutes fir more than half an hour and they mostly bring you cold food which you yourself have to cook again.I am tremendously disappointed with the service and the prices.,1
"My order was cancelled stating that there is an issue with my address, though that is my usual address on which i order. There chat support service is the most stupid support service, they just send automatic replies with no resolution. They said because as per the gps my current location was far from my adress so the order is rejected. I was travelling and my flat was open to receive the order.I didn't receive my order and they didn't refund my money.",1
Can't apply promo code sometimes. And the delivery time says 33 mins. But comes like at 50 mins. If we ask the delivery guy he says one more place we had to order from. Well then put the estimated time as 50 mins. We won't order from that place.,1
Very Bad experience using the App. The delivery personnel's are good but the App is worst. It gave a wrong location while detecting my GPS location. I ended up paying 200 extra for my order twice this happened. I'm not going to use Zomato ever.,1
It is good. I don't feel it has any such drawback. The reason i would say for rating 4 star would be because one thing which disappointed me is there is no confirmation whether the restaurant is actually open or not but overall the app is good.,4
"The worst ever food delivery app. I paid for the order, tried calling the assigned delivery guy but he doesn't pick up and cancels my order. I didn't even get my money back nor the order. It caused a lot of inconvenience to me and I'm never going to use this useless application ever again.",1
"I've been waiting for 2 hours for my order which is still ""being prepared"" but, upon calling the delivery person I find out, has been cancelled. I've been trying to contact Zomato through their Chat interface for the last one minute but apparently their customer care executives are too busy for me. Sorry Zomato, my bad for wasting my time with you.",1
"The new update is the worst kinda update wherein it's difficult to search for restaurants in your locality, most of the restaurants are showing closed for delivery and I am also not able to see my zomato levels ....I have preferred zomato over any other food app but now I am switching to swiggy ....Zomato bring back the older version or else ppl will leave you as we all are very frustrated with this update",1
Order was cancelled but yet to receive the money back after 15 days. The chat executives keep on telling you will get in 5-7 days..they refuse to send the acknowledgement mail that they have refunded the amount which is ridiculous. This is not an isolated case and is faced by many others. The RRN number is useless without the mail as the bank or Google Pay asks for a mail. The best part was that the order was out for delivery when it got cancelled. That is not my fault.,1
Very user-friendly interface . app runs smoothly without any hiccups and the best part about this app is that your saved location is detected automatically and you don't have to choose the delivery address everytime.,5
"There should be cancellation option, I by mistake chosed nonveg item and within a minute I complained but order didn't cancel. There should be option for cancellation, how order are prepared even in a minute. It's a type of cheating and trapping for customer.",1
The app is nice but the customer service is the worst. I had cancelled an order because it had egg in it and I did it within 5 minutes of ordering it and zomato shut off my cash on delivery. What if I don't have a card? Or paytm? What is the use of me having this app? Very disappointing.,1
Worst app i have ever used waited for the order for 1:30 hour trying to reach the restaurant but they are not picking up the call trying to reach customer support but no one is there . Swiggy rules all over it we can contact delivery boys and they have a good customer support fed up of Zomato i would recommend to go and buy the food instead using Zomato its all fake,1
Order via on time delivery or free option. Or else they will deliver is disappointment. Pay the additional buck to get your food delivered or they won't even bother if your food is being delivered or not. I'm a gold member and have never been so disappointed with them,1
Now I like the app .It is now very easy to use and of course very fast delivery of the meal.This is the best food delivery .through before i dont like the app but after the update it is very nice.,5
"Horrible customer care experience. have ordered from dominos and the restaurant has cancelled the order, but the app marked the order as delivered. When i started a chat with customer care executive the only response i could get is - we are not managing dominos related order. if that is the case why the hell is dominos listed in your app. i spent my money for nothing and i have lost all the hope on zomato.",1
"You will find items cheaper on other online delivery apps like swiggy. I was about to order a mission course from zomato n out of curiosity checked the same item on swiggy, noticed the same item with exact same quantity was 25% cheaper on swiggy. Definitely regret being a zomato gold member and paying higher price :'(",2
"Everytime I plan to order the food, I come across new type of charge gets added to the final bill. Also observed food price difference in the restaurant menu and online menu. Zomato being delivery partner I feel it need to improve on the pricing accuracy.",2
"This is the worst food delivery app I have ever seen. Assigns to delivers for a delivery person, whose addresses are in 2 different directions in mid night and made me wait for 3 hours. Frequently orders get messed up and one or the other item will be missing.",1
"My zomato app and pro membership has been useless for months as I can't order anything online due to payment blockade due to ""suspicious activity"". I have raised this issue several times and no corrective action was taken by zomato other than worth less pacifying words. Everytime I send a complaint email, I will get back just an email of void promises. Am tired of complaining and chatting with your ridiculous online support over app.",1
"I faced issues twice in this last 2 days. Poor service. One hour ago i ordered food. Still i didn't get it. I called my Zomato vallet , he said that it's not assigned to him. When i chat with Zomato , it's informed to write a mail to Zomato. I wrote it. Don't know when they will read it. When i will get my food ? Hotel guy confirmed that he got my order at 9pm. He dispatched order at 9:10pm. Now time is 9:58pm. From last 50min, my order is roaming some where.. What to do now Zomato ??",1
They have a trick first the order is more expensive than the restaurant menue then they offer a coupon like 40% off on it I place an order on my home location and 25 mins later the order is delivered to my work location the app blaimed it on me as it were my mistake and I din get the food nor the refund as I paid vaia credit card for the order The customer service has no call lines n it took me 20 mins to find the chat option which took 50 mins of my time total waste swigy is 100 times better,1
Never order in Zomato. They cheat a lot. U ll see a lot of free items while ordering but u will never recieve those items. Even when u check order history u can't find them. This is very unrpofessional and never seen in Swiggy or UberEats. I hope several others had also similar experiance.,1
The customer service is extremely poor. I have been delivered the wrong food item so many times. Last night i placed an order from my friend's account. I was again delivered the wrong food item. They didn't entertain my complaint on time. They didn't refund the entire amount that i paid and there is no contact number through which i can make a call. I cannot contact zomato except through the chat service (which is useless). How am i supposed to share the id with you? Where is the option? Should I share it here?,1
Amazing service and it reaches on time. Food is always warm and I am really satisfied!! Gold is really helpful but I would suggest it to expand the variety of Gold restaurants. Other than that it is amazing 👍,5
There is often bad network which is why location and complete address is being given so that the delivery boy can get to the address and ring the door bell. But this is just lazy attitude. Extremely disappointing experience.,1
Absolutely ridiculous professionalism. Not even worth mentioning such details. Mentioning details of the shameful service would be inhumane. What happened should not have happened to stray animals let alone humans.,1
"I ordered on 5th June around 9:30 pm. Order not delivered, but in zomato app it showing order delivered. I called the restaurant, they confirmed that order not deliverd. I called customer care number of zomato. They told that I have to mail. I mailed. I am now in waiting mode for my refund, its already 48 hours passed. I don't know how many hours I have to wait for my refund.",1
"I have been using zomato since last 3 years. Had worst customer service and delivery experience. Received half eaten/open packaging and incomplete order several times, order never gets delivered on time also several times order got cancelled after 2 hours of placing the order. The worst part is the customer service, they keep you waiting for so long, to every problem they cancel the order and refund simply, they don't care how hungry you are or how long you have been waiting for your order.",1
"The new version has removed reviewer's ability to leave half stars. This makes no sense for a food app. Would it not be idiotic if IMDB only allowed reviewers to choose 0,2,4,6,8 or 10 for movie ratings? Of course it would be. Go back to the old rating system. The new one is garbage.",3
"Dear Zomato, Believe me, I order from your app every now and then. It's a ritual to browse through the restaurants at evening. More so, with December offers! But I will uninstall and never ever recommend you, unless you take back that delivery man, give him his job and give a public acknowledgement of his efforts.",3
"Look, nowadays almost everything on social media is over reliant on money to make the maximum profit possible. These apps are not an exception. While the food is okay and sometimes very good, the prices always feel like we deserved a lot more food.",4
Horrible support receiving from the customer care. These guys are having same pre record messages and not at all helpful. Orders are always running late and the app is showing timer which is not getting updated properly. The timer shows 9 mins even after 20 mins . Cheating,1
A good place to quench your hurger as per the mood. The most fascinating things is that the app provides so many options from budget to hi fi that you wont be ever disappointed. i think the customer care support method should have call system which i havent seen in zomato this at times make more annoying because chat support doesnt addres the issues the way we expect. hope to get some more additions in the app to meet the customer expectations,4
Delivery experience is bad. They don't give support contact no and their app is not very intuitive. If you don't receive the order or if you want to cancel their app and response is very slow.,1
I had ordered food through zomato where they kept changing the valet every 5 minutes..on enquiring the restaurant told they had packed the food 30 mins back but nobody had arrived for pickup..it is very frustrating to keep waiting for a prepaid order for more than 30 mins without any place to complain..very poor service.,1
"@google my reviews are getting deleted. i had given one star for zomato and bounce. both cant be seen now. if this is getting deleted as well, i will definitely share the screen shot with everyone in all available platforms. @zomato: your delivery guy after reaching the restaurant and taking my order, marked my order as delivered and accepted other order. he called me and said he will deliver mine only after collecting the other. it took him one and a half hour to deliver my order.",1
"Careful, about auto renewal of membership Gold or any other option available at other places. Once subscribed the membership is on Auto renewal & gets renewed a day prior without asking for a confirmation before charging the Credit Card trusted with Zomato. And after renewal any promotion offered to existing or new customers also is refused & not given. Advice, please remove auto renewal to get better renewal offers, one won't get any benefits trusting Zomato with automatic renewal",2
"Amazing app. I like the way they show me my ratings for the previous orders so that I don't have to think about how was the food when I ordered it the last time. Good options of restaurants as well. Inthis lockdown, they have been amazing in terms of maintaining hygiene and sanitation. Kudos team! I don't think I'll ever stop using your services. Keep up the good work!",4
"Though I'm having an active 4g data on my mobile and I'm able to play high quality videos online, why you app is not able to show items. Most of the times, it shows ""Something went wrong""",2
"Only one complaint with zomato that they don't give us enough time to cancel order. I was looking at menu to choose what to order and somehow my ph. slipped from my hand when i looked back at my ph order was already being placed i didn't get enough time to even cancel it, it was like in 3 sec order was placed and because my paytm a/c was added with zomato, payment was also deducted & where i m vegetarian i got chicken Biryani to eat. Please give ur customer enough time to make sure order is righ",4
"Customer support service pathetic. If chat support team available once issues raise they immediately go off. Not a good in customer support service. Waste of time zomato. If we ordered Veg food, will be Non veg food. Not really strict rules to Partners hotel and restaurants. In online order menu price is different than the actual hotel menu price has lot different for each and every items. Make sure you should give same in online order as actual hotel menu items price",1
I have been using their service from long time and noticed recently about their system glitch which costed me double the bill.My last order was placed and amount deducted but their app shown transaction incomplete and I went ahead and made another order.After 5 min when I checked both the order was getting prepared.Called their customer service and they insisted it's my fault.They said they will never refund. ### ZOMATOCHEAT###,1
Pathetic service.. Their support team is real slow in response. This is the second time I'm having issues with this stupid service. Switching to a different service provider is the solution as I've not faced any problems elsewhere.,1
"Worst experience I had with this organization. I placed an order which was delayed that's fine. But driver marked me order as delivered and didn't delivered it. I contacted customer service chat and they are absolutely useless I asked to connect me to manager they simply refuse to do it and saying they are the gods of zamato. Very rude, unprofessional behavior. Then I asked for ombudsment team details and he refuse to provide it and said zamato do not follow Indian law. What a shame.",1
"This is the single worst service of all time. My order was not delivered. No one responded to the chat for half an hour. Don't waste your money on this. Edit- 2 years later, this continues to be awful.",1
Love the app for it's simplicity with the details provided. My first go to app when checking out a place to dine. But it needs to work on the Zomato Gold membership as it needs to cover more restaurants in the city.,4
this is a worst food delivery app.. either a different item is delivered.. or the item is not delivered at all.. there is no check performed for the restaurants authenticity there is no training provided to the delivery persons.. and the support team oh my goodness what a team.. with all always the same answer in a different way.. sorry for the inconvenience caused.. we regret the unpleasant experience.. sorry but there is nothing we can do.. sorry we hope we can serve you better next time,1
"MRP of same food from same restaurant on same day, is higher on your application and apart from this you still charge extra in the name of service. How can an item of 250 be sold on your application for 320?? uber eats and swiggy seems to be a better choice with better discounts. !! Poor service",1
"I raised a concern over the quality of food delivered with Zomato's chatting bot. To which it asked me if I would like to have a refund or just inform the restaurant about the quality issue. Here's the trick, I could not select the refund option!!! Only informing to the restaurant was active. I took a snapshot and mailed to Zomato's customer service mail expecting a human to respond. After 24 hrs I got a standard response worse than their chatting BOT. Grow Up Zomato and stop playing cheap games",2
"Horrible customer service, we did not receive the order completely with items missing but they did nothing to resolve. Wasted 1 hr trying to call restaurant tge number did not connect and Zomato insisted they can't do anything about it. What's the point, where did the food go missing? Delivery boy ate it?",1
Used to love this app. But the customer care service sucks!! They delivered a completely wrong item from subway to me and it's been over a month since they told me that a refund was initiated and i still haven't got it after complaining like 5 times.,2
Worst app ever . Every time there is one item missing from your order. They wont accept it either and they give you 40 discounts points. We have ordered food for a reason because we want food not discount points. Very dissapointed.,1
it's awesome service and top service plan to go to the app use my referral code ( P U S H 6 7 8 8 7 ) it's really good Applation. She is a good time to go to sleep now 👶 👧 and she said it would make a decision on my phone was dead tired to go 🔙 to the 💪 now so I can get ( P U S H 6 7 8 8 7 ) so very much Amazing app loot long time app hai bhai log Downlod karo paisa ki Geranti meri rahegi App is realy god so loved the way to the gym.,5
"My friends have better offers than me on this app, it's cheating. Promo code codes like ZOMATO not working And now they had removed chat support or customer support, you will have to write a mail to them, Zomato is an 30-60 mins service and if you have any issue you will have to mail them about it and they will revert you when you have already suffered the situation.",1
Its an extremely helpful app where the valets are always ready to serve u and bring your favorite food upto your hands wherever and whenever you want....the app is free from all those disturbing commercial ads ...varieties of options available for the user....very useful for bachelors and foodies....,3
"I ordered from zomato you made the delivery in more than one hour and you have no remedy for the same.on zomato app time was 37 minute and it converted in to more than one hour and we customer have no platform to connect with zomato.You don't have call support, you have strict policy for cancellation but no policy for late delivery. Your support service is worst..when u are aware you are late on delivery,you are delivering multiple order and giving excuses about environment.No remedy for us.",1
your new policies seem to be a way to loot customers. inspite of providing an alternate number on delivery instructions youll have given me full penalty charge on the order i didnt recieve. I will change this review when you resolve this issue fairly because I wasnt able to reach the restaurant or the delivery boy either.,1
"MOST HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. Every 2nd or 3rd order will have an issue of some kind. And when you talk to the so called ""support"", all you get in response is just the patronizing messages like ""kindly be online. We are looking at the issue. "" and nothing actually happens.",1
While placing the order on zomato at the time of transaction when i have opened my messaging app for some purpose zomato app goes into background and got bad gateway error.. money was deducted from my account but no order placed. even no message or email got about this issue from there side... how it came to be a big company need to think on it and i have tried to contact theire support team but they are not responding to my messages.. solved the small n silly bugs investors plz invest in talent,1
"The restaurants available there are good but I suggest don't pay online..I faced a problem, I ordered online and wanted to cancel the order but they don't give that option sometimes, though I didn't took that food they didn't refund that money",1
my experience with zomato is the worst than all the apps i have ever used. they did not refunded my money twice .no customer care number to call and solve the issue. and they will give u a mail id for your issues and you will not get any response from that mail. they just have a habbit of making fool of the customers,1
"Worst experience ! most the orders are either wrong or are too oily, i would never recommend anyone to order from this app. Moreover there is no provision of refund on wrong orders, only a coupon which can not be clubbed with any other. It really sucks.",1
Totally wrost app. Order is accepted by zomato but not placed some time. This was happening with me iven if at night also they take order and some time can't deliver. Because of misunderstanding between their staff customer face the problem. Customer care also can't solve the problem.,1
"very bad experience with the customer support. they don't reply for hours, at the last they make you frustrated by replying "" we hope that the problem is resolved"" how will the problem be solved when you have not taken any action.",1
"the worst app. actually I think Zomato don't give any tips to the delivery persons. so they are ready to harash people for the extra money. I ordered some food in my home address and they told me they can't come to deliver because the GPS is misleading them. I tried to convince them, also talk to the delivery man, after that I agreed to give the delivery man a fifty rupees tip then he agreed to deliver the food.",1
First experience with Zomato and im already disappointed. App is cool but not the service ..I had an issue and they took an hour to respond with 2-3 automated messages.There were items missing in my order and Did not refund the amount for the missing items in the delivery.,1
Useless company with useless policies. I ordered some food from it and after ordering it saw that my address was incorrectly marked I reported it to their customer care but no reply then I called the delivery guy he said that it will be checked but after then I received call and they said that I am not accepting the order they made my account invalid for COD payment also they made 220 ruppes fine on my next order. It is fix that zomato is a very inappropriate site.,1
Many restaurants details provided in this app are incorrect. Even the Zomato service desk not able to connect with restaurant. Second time items are missing from order and for the same no proper response provided and less refund is provided after 24hr in Zomato wallet not in original source. No proper action are taken.,1
"While Zomato claims that the pro program is an upgrade... It isn't... The discount given on Zomato Pro is already available via dineout and eazydiner and there is no membership fees charged there... Apart from that the delivery and packaging charges are so high on the app that the discount is NEGLIGIBLE... if I am paying for premium membership, I have to feel that I am a premium customer... the membership has degraded over time... Transition from the best premium membership to the worst.",1
Yes.. it's very good and quick delivery,5
"The support has become horrendous. I didn't get my order, no one showed up at the door. And on top of that I have been charged the full order amount and have not been given any refund. The only help they offer is a ""mail us for help"". And they can't do anything because ""Zomato policy"".",1
"Worst app ever. I ordered food from it and it showed that the food will reach to me within 30 mins but after 15 min it got cancelled and the reason stated me was that the restaurant is not operating today, if the restaurant was not operating today then why the hell this app showed that me order was accepted and being prepared. Worst app ever.",1
"it does not show the full menu,or sometimes shows that the restaurant isn't accepting orders. whereas in other apps, I can order. plz improve your app. Currently, it is positioned as a food review app, not as a food ordering app.",1
"The continue button after entering the mobile number stays disabled. It appears that the app does not allow new registration. Consequently, people are going to end up downloading other similar apps. Not my loss. Usually wouldn't leave any feedback, but was feeling very generous today.",2
"Cheap and Good food. Very reliable. If there's any problem, you are able to contact the driver personally and give directions. Some driver may not communicate in English very well but 95% do.",5
"Great offers, nice interface and bunch of payment options. The customer support is not that good, however. I am giving 5 stars because I found the app better than any other food ordering app currently available.",5
"The app is not user-friendly, especially for online orders. They do not provide a tracking option and there have been several times when my order has arrived very late but the executive had a casual approach about it.",3
Pathetic service. I ordered food @ 9:30 pm it never got delivered. @12 am customer care told me that they are sorry and they have placed a new order for me and it will get delivered within 55 mins. Guess what I waited till 2:30 but order never arrived. Sleeping Empty stomach today coz of Zomato. This is third such incident with zamato. Guys be careful Go for swiggy or Food Panda. I m leaving This pathetic service provider....,1
"Unnecessarily increased delivery charged. Even after providing exact location they ask for location again and again on call. Sometimes we find delivered food in bad shape with teared packaging , Leakage in packing etc and and if you order fast food like pizza sometimes they give you other items woth it somethimes not .",1
"Changed the T&C after purchasing the gold membership, if you had to change T&C let it be same for the older customer. It's like cheating your customers. Will never consider renewing it if they don't change it back to the older one.",1
Worst online app which does not have any help support option nor a customer toll free number where a customer can call and describe the problem. App does not allow you to even select the exact problem and states by saying hope ye have helped you and please rate us. Zomato is just playing with a customer's hard earned money and don't bother to resolve a single query.,1
Food delivery from here has been pathetic experience. Dealing with the valet has been one of the most difficult experiences. Valet cancelled the order as the order was delayed by the restaurant and I had to spend a good 10 min co-ordinating with new delivery valet and the restaurant before they confimred i would receive the food i ordered. Eventually got my food after 1hour 30 min. Will think twice before i use zomato again,2
If they deliver half of your order they want you to order again for the remaining half and for that you have to again pay the taxes and delivery charge 😡 all they will say that they can't do anything from their end.. max they can give you promocode.. 😡😡 wish I could give zero rating.. this is the third time I am facing this issue.. they purposely don't deliver your full order and that too main of the order which I pre paid.. 😡,1
"Zomato service is sick. My kid mistakenly placed the order and i took an immediate action to cancel it but the chat with the customer service took an eternity to open. So, I immediately called the delivery boy to cancle if it's possible from his end. Theywere just not ready to process it. And i did not get the point of charging me the amount of the order i want to cancle. They even said i have to pay the amount of this order in addition with the next order whenever i will place. Is this a fraud?",1
delivery charges plus surge fees and distance fees. After applying offer the item price will be same in zomato. And your delivery guys top of the world when they any order is prepaid and order is far so they start making execuses to get rigd of order. It happen many times to me.,1
very bad delivery process,1
Fast and good,5
Great app for food delivery with great offers. Just one suggestion i would like to give that add more area to your territory. Because earlier i had face this problem in several areas you guys don't provide your service. Otherwise this app is great...,5
"Very very worst because your location detector is not proper ...there is no COD option ......it takes long time to deliver .....some time the order is cancelled after long time ....refund amount is not instant , it takes long time to refund .....there is lot more problems I am facing so that's y i hate this app",1
"My experience with this was pathetic, my daughter has placed order, and recently we changed flat, she realised that after placing order, in a hurry she cancelled order, she was not aware of zomato policy, they had cancelled order and not given refund back, after insisting them so many time as this is happened in a hurry but they didnt cooperate, not they had given same order and not refund, poor my daughter get so frustrated that she was crying whole night, as because of her hurryness she lost mo",1
"very bad experience about customer service , there customer support is not even reply about customer concern on chat,they can't even sync up data from there own chat when you call them, had too better experience from swiggy in comparison of zomato. not able to resolve problem even after 48 hours. very disgusting 😒😒",1
"1. There is no option to call the customer care service to address our grievances. It takes a lot of time to write which is a waste and then to wait for the reply and then to explain in detail the problem. It is pathetic. 2. Now with the new update, they have bots to responde you where you can only select from pretermined options and you can't even type? Which is a lot more pathetic than my concern in point No. 1...",1
"With out any proper guide line they add small venders, street food , hotel...for which we got low quality food...this is not a good way to income money.u think customer money is like tree leaf...I never use this app in future and going to uninstall..my 1st and last order with Zomato.. Requesting you all customer don't waste ur money...go to near by quality hotel and purchase..ur mind definitely satisfied.. Zomato have no control I hate Zomato...",1
Worst service and a pathetic response 😡 I had unistallef the app after i got a wrong order for breakfast at 9.30 and waited after escalating the issue till 11.30 but still the response was we are working to resolve the issue. Great uninstalled the app and i know you wont bother much as i am one among millions of customers but one day you lose all the customers with such a pathetic mistakes and bad customer service. Want to rate zero but unfortunately its not available.,1
The price of the items in zomato for few restaurants are more than 20 percent they sell at the restaurant. Even after applying promo code..its not worthy and satisfying as it doesn't even match restaurants price. It's better to walkin to restaurant directly and order instead of using zomato.,1
"The customer care is really lousy. The app is extremely faulty and sometimes, the order wouldn't even be directed to a restaurant despite it telling you so. And what else can I say, except for the fact that I'm just disappointed.",1
"food delivered, but always incomplete, if u complain nothing will happen, only reply is we will comply it in next time. But nothing. once again no is receiving the complain. Rather than that I can't contact the hotel, because there phone number is not connecting, and can't cancel the order too, bad experience of the aap.",1
Its one of the worst app. The customer service is extremely pathetic. I had ordered a large ice cream from cream and stone. Received an incorrect order. The customer service did not bother to resolve it. The money paid was just a waste. I won't recommend this app for anyone.,1
Why doesn't this so called food delivery app doesn't let the customers track their order in the map? All your competitors have while you don't and in the app it said 30min to delivery and when I paid it showed one hour. Highly dissatisfied with this app.,1
the worst experience. I ordered a readymade cake and as the delivery time was too long... so i wished to cancel but these people say they cant cancel as food prep had begun and cancellation charge of the full amount was to be charged if i wished to cancel people swiggy is way better with better offers and better customer care!,1
"WORST EXPERIENCE. Order at your own risk. Now days they are resorting to new techniques, they accept full order and send partial order. When asked for, their constant response is we can't connect with restaurant to confirm the same. Irony is, the rider is confirming about the partial order but they won't accept that too. Further, if asked for a refund, their response is take promocode and use in next order. Seeing such service, would a person ever order again?",1
"These chat people don't know how to talk to their customer's, they can't even communicate with their restaurants properly.. Hence first improve ur. communcation system beacuse it's not the matter of food, it's the matter of way they communicate with their customers. Please check my last chat with their executive. Hence, finally from today onwards no more Zomato ..",3
Disappointed with the service and there is no any toll free no. to get help instantly.when i downloaded this app it says for new users 50 % off for 1st 5 order.i ordered 2 times with 50 % off and 3rd time it says promo code is invalid.this code is valid for only new users.how it is possible if i used it for twice only.it means u r cheating on us and making fool us.😫😫😫,1
"Zomato in general is fine but never go for Zomato Gold, it is not worth it. Very few dine in option and some delivery restaurants are roadside eatery shops without any quality, some are kitchen only (no dine in). Their customer service is useless most of the time Edit: After Zomato gold pay, very few restaurants even offer 1+1 or 2+2 . Zomato should have asked people who have already been subscribed if they wanted to continue",1
Everything is ok but for delivery they show a time frame which is freezed for more than 5 min or so .... to fool customers.. also the delivery guys always click on order picked up but still they are at the restaurant and that's when time is freezed ..... why fool customers on such small things ??,2
"Worst experience, very unsupportive customer service representative, simply telling me unable to initiate any refund for bad quality if you guys are taking order then you should also take responsibility of the quality. If I person is ordering something from your app that means you should also maintain trust of your customers. Found difficult to chat with customer representative agent.",1
"Worst ever support. They 30% of the time didn't deliver the complete order, then they will try to finish the issue with 50 Rs voucher after ruining your meal. 3 4 times we have faced such issues and their executive are like machines they don't listen but ends chat once you are not agreeing with them",1
"They have taken money, cancelled the order and did not return the amount",1
Love the App...but do wish the delivery personnel were better...a while back this fellow refused to enter my premises and stood outside attending a call...I had to come down to collect my food because...and this is the reason he gave...there was a cat sleeping with its kittens in my courtyard! In which world was he attacked by a domestic cat,4
Worst service I have never seen..Everytime I have given correct address but zomato delivery boy is telling incorrect address without informing me he was cancelled my food delivery.. My amount also got deducted.. But customer care service telling that no refund & no food.. This is not happening for the 1st time. I had made a complaint also but there is no use. What's the service is this?,1
"Why my address is not showing in zomato app...? I have tried too many times bt its nt accepting my address... On map.. . Even though i always get delivered according to my written address... But today, they gave me a reason that your map address is different form your written address... And got my order cancel... I have already ordered many times before.. They all came after a verbal communication.",1
My order was canceled as delivery boy was a cycle rider and couldn't deliver but I was charged cancelation fee and on sending a complaint on app... My msg were not being sent on app ... It horrible to pay due to such things ... They were replying that address was wrong when it was completely correct with landmark,1
This is the worst app! I'm at month end and have less amount of money! Three of my orders failed and they didn't refund me Rs.5000+ yet! Not even a compensation credit for this issue! Worst customer support and worst app ever! Never order from them ever again! I'm completely helpless without money now! They just ask me to wait for the refund and they never did!,1
poor services. they will never provide you satisfaction. and they do not hear any misbehave or complaint. bad bad bad very bad customer support. they will irritate you with same apologies lines for every complaint. they are robots with their copy paste lines. i have had so many bad experience with them everytime i order. swiggy is dling great in customer satisfaction. i have removed Zomato from my food apps for forever.,2
"i had ordered food in which packaging was broken . i complained and also shared pics for the same . no response from the support team . they kept saying we are looking into the issue . same had happend earlier too , restaurent cancelled my order after around 1.5 hrs of ordering , still no action by zomato",1
"Zomato is providing a very good and friendly services. If I feel any issue related to any order, they keep an eye concern on the demand. They get us food at the door step in a very short period. Now I can easily have food of 2 places at one time! 😋Thanks to the zomato for providing services in our city! Love ordering on Zomato!🤩",5
"Clicking on Support isn't working. Clicking on submit while payment isn't working many times, money gets deducted and it syill stays in same page. Your money will be refunded message/mail also is not sent!!!!! Rediculous. Now , clicking on ""Support"" is not working.",1
No proper response for any issues,1
Worst chat support and worst food too....everytime i order something and something else is delivered....and the chat support team is so rude nd just asking me to disappear and just disconnected chat in the middle of conversation.....👍i am now going to apply for case in consumer Court...lets see if something happens there in my favor or will i be disappointed from there as well... now good a bit,5
"The latest version is very buggy. On most restaurant when I click on the restaurant menu information, the app crashes or return to the blank screen. The dev needs to fix this ASAP. The restaurant menu information is the reason I installed this app.",1
chat options cleverly limited to zomato's convenience.......you can't raise a issue of your concern........,1
I do find it really helpful... (As I have to work at night...... )for even making delivery after 3am....only drawback was it couldn't find my location... It was like 500 m away.. From my actual location.. Then guiding the rider is another issue..anyways.. Thank u so much...keep improving..!,4
"if there was zero I would choose that, I ordered at 8:45 and now it 11:30 and never received the order and your customer services kept telling me give me few minutes.now I received a notification to rate food that i never received.i didn't even get a refund for my order. never using this app again",1
Good app more features more useful in pandemic,4
"Worst experience. I gave 1 star just bacause delivery was very quick but when i looked at my order (pizza), its top was like rubber.totally disappointed. And also 50% cashback was there when i placed the order but my account was credited with only 25%.why is it so? 😣🙄",1
"What if Valet switches off phone just before reaching your delivery location with no trace for next 1 hour. What if the Valet tells you he has some techinical glich and will not deliver your order after 30 mins of placing your order. Imagine this happening day by day and zomato refunding you the paid amount as a goodwill gesture, sometime giving you extra coupons without caring about what you are going to eat because finally delivery failed. Think about Zomato. They have started this goodwill.",1
"Ordered food through this app. It has been over 1 hour and I am still waiting . Tried reaching Zomato support and they are absolutely disgusting , they keep saying please wait but there is no response . This has happened like almost 3 times . A person is hungry and orders food and it takes 1.5 hours and still no clue . What a service",1
"Price of food items taken by Zomato is the almost double the price of those food as per menu of restaurant along with additional taxes. I had seen multiple times that Whatever I had ordered ,did not get the same and in place of my ordered food stuff, similar but cheaper food items delivered to me without my consent. That's y , this is my suggestion for everyone , Aatm-nirbhar bne, khud se khana bnane sikhe otherwise Zomato wale aapko loot lenge aur aapko pta v nhi chlega!",1
"Till today I had listened about zomato order and food quality issue but today i have experienced it. Even they are not providing option to return, realy i kept this after one bite and looking for the option to call customer care but did not get. I sent them mail with spoiled food and the food was messed up photos, but no response except 33 rupees off on next order.",1
"The app doesnt have any mechanism to receive the real complaint of customers. It uses an automated reply which is of no use.. Its feels better to interact with human, who can understand ur problems rather than talking to a robot.",1
"WTH is wrong with you, just placed an order and there are some items missing in the order, on starting the chat, they without letting me write anything reply, ""we are sorry and thank you for the feedback"", feedback my foot. Used to order from UBEREATS earlier, since when ZOMATO has taken it, has left me optionless...",1
"Guys, it would be amazing if I don't have to see what apps I'm recommended as I'm scanning the order tracking page for some crucial info. At least put it out of the way instead of parking it right in between info I seek. I don't think anybody installs apps based on the recommendations as they wait for food to be delivered as it is",3
"i had ordered an item and mentioned the correct address. The app showed the right location during the order however, later the customer care executive called me and says that the location is point to a different place some 2 kms away. they cancelled my order and refused refund. just scamming people and trying to take money using such tricks.",1
Amazon pay options is not available in payment mode Swiggy has that,2
This restaurant is good for nothing. Makes big commitments but can't fulfill any. They are lucky that they got a good cook. But delivery MG more than 3 hours and the quantity it does not match the price. We can go for Mandi instead of paying huge sm to this restaurant and waiting forever for delivery.,1
"27 June 2020 - I had issue as I was overcharged than what the actual restaurant bill floated. But their explanation changes time by time. First they said ""some taxes"" are applied. After I asked why taxes not mentioned in the bill, they say it is not of taxes, but related to delivery charges. Even though everything is in the bills, they somehow want to justify the overpricing. No convincible resolution. Also you need to send them reminders to reply you in email. Uninstalled!",1
Worst experience. I order food it gets cancelled without my knowledge and no one calls. They deduct money from my account and then becomes irresponsive. That's very sad for a food related app. Already mailed on the mentioned and even more saddened by their standard reply,1
The amount snowed me different on time of the order and when it reached the bill was with extra 70s... Delivery personal said the amount had been later added because of distance... Like really you should have added the distance and showed me before I would have never ordered... This is why I hate zomato.,3
Definitely not a app I will ever use in future. So in short story in my coupon got expired and Zomato representative told me it will be regenerated in 7-10 day but nothing happened even after 2 months. I asked them to refund my gold he said okey no problem we can refund your gold membership and guided me to do so. I asked for my refund and he asked me to wait for 7-10 days it's been already 3 months that they are asking me to wait 7-8 days. Please Refund my Money Zomato. please.,1
No more customer friendly. You guys don't care anymore for your customers. You charged falsely to your customers without any logic and more disappointed this is that one can chat only on the issue you want. Customer should have option to chat on whatever they want regarding the order.,1
such a bad app whenever I order at night I paid online. they didn't deliver my order and the delivery boy is giving me excuse that he not getting the house. and at last the app showing me that my order has been delivered. and that Zomato chat box never help me out on this matter so guys seriously you have to look for this. and I need my payment back.,1
"they exploiting to the customer especially for online paid customer, they don't listen complain of customers, it's customer services are only plays with words, no instant reply and they don't refund the amount you paid actually wasted on worst food and this not first time it have already happened several times, I did complaint to directly restaurant for Unfresh, tasteless food and they agreed in it and asked to drop a msg to zomato customer care and I did but zomato refused to refund me. goback",5
"Wrost service from zomoto Bangalore. i have placed an today around 8pm but even after 2 hours waiting no update on the order page and no calls from delivery person, no support from zomoto, pathetic service, surprisingly without delivered the food, they simply updated the order status to delivered and send notification for food feedback. what a service from zomoto?!!! really surprised from u r support and services!!!!?",1
"For most of the time app is unable to detect my location. Even if sometimes it detect it ,it automatically shows address which is wrong and worst part is it did not accept manual address correction. This problem I didn't encountered with other online food delivery Apps.",1
shopkeeper sent unwanted item this is very disappointed for everyone and play with emotion of customer.,1
"Pathetic experience with Zomato. They track your location without your consent even when your GPS is not enabled. I order from my current location(Xyz) and choose delivery location as my Home. But the Zomato delivery boy went to my current location(Xyz) for delivery. When I reached to Customer Care, they also agreed, they updated my current location(Xyz) and choose as an delivery location.",1
It really makes me feel happy when you crave for something and you can find 50percent discount is always there whenever i want to have on the restaurant you choose. Good Job guys. Loving this app.,5
"I ordered pizza from NYC, the order was to deliver at 10:42 pm but the food is still in kitchen. I am unable to track and no response from the Zomato. The number provided of NYC in the Zomato app is continuously busy and I think it's on purpose as I am trying from last one hour to connect with them.",1
offers are good... but sometimes when you r not able to deliver food u should inform prior... if someone has ordered food and u have kept him/her her for 45 min then at the end u r informing that you won't be able to make it... that's quite bad... that's only reason I didn't give 5 🌟...,4
"Very poor chat support, no way to contact them if they have been paid money and the restaurant doesn't take order, their valet simply called up and ran away from there and no way to contact zomato to get the refund, the app showing food being prepared while the order has not been even reflected in KFC's system.",1
"Very bad service in Delhi Ncr, really i am writing the same as i have experienced same. Their executives took food from restaurents and deliver it sooooo late so we were not able to eat that cold food. Also they switch off their mobile phones so we were not able to make contact with them. Finally when we were trying to make complaint executive never picked the call they talk on chat messages which they replied very late. How can a company can run without their customer. So rubbish.....",1
Worst app ever....Wish it could have negative rating!! I ordered for one dish and they brought me another..! I tried a lot to call them back and to accept the return of my order..they are never picking up the phone nor enabling any kind of customercare service..waste of my money..,1
"I like this app and I am using it since long time. But nowadays there are some restaurants, who are not using Zomato delivery app (because of some payment issues). Personally I am facing issues bcz of this. It's my advise to Zomato to maintain the proper business relation with the restaurants bcz your app is running bcz of them. There are some system issues regarding issuing delivery to delivery guys delivery orders are going to the guys who are far from the restaurants. Thank you!",5
"Please let me know why did you remove the levels for the reviewers in the new version? That allowed us to stay motivated to write reviews in your app. Since it's gone, I don't feel like giving any review for restaurants because there is no feeling of competition and a certain sense of achievement",2
"Once i had got bad. quality food i raised a complaint and they refunded the amount There was an inconvenience because when you're ordering food you'll be hungry and expect good, but overall good experience after that i didn't have any such situations. Good work zomato keep it up",4
It is the number one cheeting app. which cheets its customers without delivering food and returning the money. Not only eating the food while delivering but also eating customers money without delivering the food. They dont have guts to share the customer care number any where in the app. Dont prefer this app.,1
Why do you provide the address field in the app when the zomato valet does not even look at it for order deilvery ? When the address is correct how can the zomato spoke cancel the order ? I have not been provided with adequate support even after writing on the email given. My time and money both wasted with lot of inconvinience caused. Before reverting to the email the order details should be checked by the support staff. Lot of inconvinience caused.,1
Every 2 year zomato is changing its app UX tremendously. It takes couple of months to adjust and remember the ui and suddenly everything is new. This makes me not to use zomato. Nobody likes change and improving ux is a slow process. Im not sure if anyone else face this issue,2
constantly kept delivering my orders late and there is no proper communication portal for issues.,1
"Good app. But sometimes no one is responsible for receiving wrong order after being placed. Also, order is delayed most of the time and still they take extra delivery charges. Update - Support is improved now. But should consider if delivery charges are actually required.",3
"There customer service is very very poor. They just cancel your order without telling you the reason for any grievance you will have to wait for atleast an hour and then they will assign you new executive who will again take an hour to respond. Honestly, Ubereats and Swiggy is and was better they have good customer service atleast. Shame on zomato.",1
Don't Download this app it's west of time... because if you placed a order by mistake or rongly they don't cancel your order. if you canceld the order that means you have to pay full amount of that canceled order amount...that's not fair...you should put option for that... I'm going to uninstall this app right now....,1
It was a very good app till the last update. To reach to the worst from the best it took only one updates time. They even removed the zomato eazy option and also a lot of good restaurants and offers. Never going to order from zomato again untill everything gets back to how it was before the update.,1
"they are cheeting, i applied the offer and didn't receive the free coffe, bad behavior, worst customer services. Very bad experience. managers ther are hiding they cant even talk to him",1
I was supposed to get Zomato credits for 2 orders of mine back in the start of September. I never received the credits even thought I contacted zomato at least 6 times on their email id and through the app.I have been using Zomato for well for a year and a half and order almost everyday.this is ridiculous treatment.and you've just lost a customer.,1
"I only order at Zomato its a hassle free experience despite their bad image in media, one should stereotype all those delivery guys just because of one or two persons. I think they work too hard to ensure that all our cravings are not lost. Keep up the good work.",5
Very good service,5
"The new update looks good for the UI, but bad at UX. It's hard to find restaurants that suits my preferences on this new update. The old version, I could easily find some restaurants that suits my preference. Can you just bring back the old search features & algorithm but keep the UI ?",3
"Terrible services from Zomato. Delivery time is more than an hour and when contacted zomato they just say it is not zomato delivery guy but the restaurant. i dont understand why Zomato has to be in middle when they dont want to take care of the order made by their guests, better we call the restaurant directly and order. I will recommend Uber Eats to everyone rather dan using Zomato they are much faster dan Zomato",1
Very good service,5
"Zomato is the perfect app. If u want to SPOIL YOUR EVENING. They will serve you with chilled food. And that too late.. if u want to order for dinner, i ll suggest u ordering by lunch so that they will came by mid night. Prefer making a COD.. Cz if the food you order.. is received ice cold.. you atleast have your money safe. :)",1
"Earlier it was fabulous, but now a days.. it is very bad .. after 10 pm order e ni ho pata, what sort of 24*7 dilivery? I mean.. it has become riddiculous now! I even uninstalled 😏 Even the list of restaurants is not available properly, i have to go to my last order and check if der would any n after dat i find so many restaurants dat are delivering.. wot sort of rubbishness is dis???",1
"Worst app..delivery boy was not able to find location and after that i called him back they told your order is canclled and after that called to customer care person who is on phone told me that your money will be refunded and before telling me reason why order is cancled she cut the phone, such rude behavior and poor service..",1
"This is the d app. My mom was not feeling well so I have used this app after many days as was having Uber app earlier but Uber app told that they have transferred it to zomato so as there was no way , I used this app. I have saved a complete address first as I knew the worst reputation of this app. Then I properly saved the address as home & selected the address. After ordering the order, I have even called the delivery boy for address , he said ok. Now he said we cannot move from r location.",1
"i have increased the stars for refunding the money.. but you must know ,it caused me a great deal of agony ,being swindled like that! provide a better grievance redressal mechanism. a customer care call center is an absolute must. the automatic reply from the chat box is of no use,it cannot handle issues that are specific to the situation! even when the agent is chatting on the other side, his response seems detached through texts. a customer helpline no is a must! please do something about this!",3
"The customer service is really bad. The hotel has my order ready, but they don't have delivery boys to pick up the order.. Then why does zomato has the location listed and why the customer is service is not responding once they know they don't have delivery boys.. Didn't expect this from such a huge company. This review is now on 12 September 19, the customer service has really gone down.",1
Really great app guys👌👌👌,5
"I was satisfied with the App, till I noticed that one you change out of cash on delivery to an online payment, the app for not allow to change it back to cash on delivery. That Is a cheap trick to ensure your money. Such Business practices should not be encouraged, I am deleting the app",1
"Order here, if you want to order at 12 o clock and see at 2.40 that your order is still in store, and after cancellation from store, get your paytm money back after 7-10 days, want to put somebody's head through the wall, won't use this app ever again👎",1
"Don't use this app at all, you will be cheated be the Zomato, i ordered the food at 11:00 PM and i had not received the food, but i got the mail in the morning at 5:00 AM, that the order got delivered, so i sent mail to the Zomato for 3 times, but i didn't get any resolution, they have not refunded my money. Please think 10 times before ordering the food from Zomato, because they don't have customer support services.",1
"dont you guys have a protocol of having a quality check of food before collaborating with a restaurant. People will give you more money (if thats only what you are after) if you give quality food. Swiggy on the other hand is a good option. Atleast they have certified restaurant and give quality food. learn from them. For general public: if you dont wanna waste time and your money and more importantly if you dont want to die, please stop considering Zomato.",1
Worst app Says gives discount but gives rubbish,2
"Giving good deals like 50% off and various choices of restaurants in which economical too included. Whenever i placed an order, eager to order next time happily. Need to expand services in the outer territory of urban extensions so that lot of people fond of food could get their happiness to place an order.😊😀",4
Nice to hv food 👍,5
"My first order with Zomato, worst experience will never use again. I placed the order at 12:32pm After waiting 30mins, spoke to valet, he informed he will pick the food in next 15mins. After waiting for another 30mins I tried reaching valet but line was busy. Then I contacted CC at 1:35pm they tell me valer could reach rhe merchant address, i.e merchat didn't prepared the food. ans no they have to cancel the order.. zomato should inform rhe status within first 20 mins. Swiggy Rocks!!",1
"The support section is of no use at all. They are supposed to be ""busy"" most of the time and issues such as missing item or food spillage is just a joke which is not properly resolved. I would not recommend this app at all as it's quality has turned awful.",1
"This app is a good choice for your hunger. But the problem is that, it don't have every location or the nearby location of my house. Its very difficult to find the correct address. Zomato should look for it, otherwise it is awesome app",4
Good for reading and giving reviews. The food search and delivery is pathetic. All the options i looked at after searching did not infact have the dish on the menu! Some did not even deliver at the current location! What will I do looking at delivery restaurants 10 miles away?,2
Very good service,5
"My bank got debited but order was not placed and I am not finding any support in any form to get it resolved.. There should be customer support services in the app itself for this type of discrepancies. Unfortunately there is none... when tried to get in touch through phone numbers on net, Delhi number keeps you waiting and east zone given number is incorrect.",2
"Excellent, on time delivery",5
Very bad app. I ordered last week and I got the inferior quality of food. Each and every time food reach after the delivery time and so late. So high taxes apply on small orders. overall the worst experience at all.,1
Very good service. Thank you everyone.,5
Very worst delivery practice,1
Its one of the worst cheating app i have ever seen. When customer cancel the order before its not even packed in the hotel the ethics is to refund the money with some penalty charges should be fine. But taking the whole money from customer for the ordered food (note: not even packed bh the hotel) showing this as cheap reason zomato has not refunded the money. This is not business ethics. Worst experience worst impression created.,1
Fast and good,5
"ridiculous service by your customer support, I'll never suggest zomato to anyone and will never use this app again. Totally unsatisfied. waiting for my order from more than a hour and your customer support taught me to wait for more 20-25 mins. chat service is of no use as they are replying late more than my crush. Uninstalling Zomato.",1
My order was cancelled by zomato after 20 min of ordering stating that the order was picked up by a bicycle delivery agent and that the distance is too far for to be covered by bicycle! Choosing the mode of delivery is not in the order menu! No happy that I got ditched at the last minute.,2
I have placed the order one and a half hour before and I stilll haven't got andy food and chat support is telling me to pay 74 extra and place a new order. They are refusing to give me the food which I paid for and my money for not giving me the food! Great Job!,1
to expensive compare to other app,1
I have been using zomato as a platform for quite long and noticed that the application has been developed to cater to all basic needs and gradually they have added features (++) catering to quality time of customers and comfort in all perspective.,5
"Very poor experience. I called the restuarant to cancel the order and they agreed as they didn't had started preparing by that time. But the zomato is not refunding my money saying the order cannot be cancelled. On top of that, I didn't get my order too. Neither the refund nor the food. Very disappointed. Never gonna order again.",1
"Zomato you need to care about the customer service. Which u guys are really avoiding it. I had two instances which clearly shows your capabilities. Last night I had ordered food using ur app when the restaurant was open and after 30 mins when I call the Zomato deliver boy he says the restaurant is closed. When I tried reaching your support team which only has chat options says they are all busy. Need to say what a good strategy to avoid the boiled up situation. You order food bcoz u r hungry and after good 30 mins u say there is nothing we can do. Please make a new order. Cheers to that. Second incident happened Today. Ordered a combo meal from Burger King. Order was delivered and it was missing my soft drink. When I had word with the Burger King's Manger and the delivery boy they are blaming each other. Finally they come up with a compensation strategy saying that they will return back the money of the drink which is 20 bucks. Come on Zomato if ur guys are making a mistake, atleast educate them to apologize and complete the task they are offered. The point that it is not about money. It's about the commitment that u make with the customer. If you cannot deliver do not make one. Your support chat is not reachable once the delivery is done. Tried calling up multiple numbers after browsing Google but no help received. Really disappointed and had to write this long. You guys are responsible. Atleast have a customer support number so that we can talk to you.",1
I used to enjoy Zomato very much at the beginning but recently it's service is bad... I complained in the chat that my shake have pieces of ice in it and they told me that the restaurant has bad reviews so don't select in such restaurants again...then I emailed them and it's also an computer generated email... I also complained about COD is not available for me and again came a computer generated email..,1
I booked my order and paid your delivery boy but it don't take my food and he is just switch off our phone . I am just complaints many time through your chat services but he don't get any solution plz consider my review and just take quick action about this . I am also share screen shoot of your delivery boy payment history and call history.,1
"App had shared promo codes which can be used for 5 times to get 50% discount and after 3rd order promo code is not valid, even customer care was of no help says code is expired as per new update, whereas in my phone a message still pops up saying apply this code to get 50% off on your next 2 orders, not only this app has multiple glitches sometimes it says no restuarunts deliver in your area and after 5 minutes when you check there are many on offer, sometimes when you are about to place the order it says restaurant doesnot deliver in your area.",2
Zomato app is a really great medium to search for restaurants and order food. They have lots of offers and options to choose from. Multiple cuisine selections are also possible and you can filter based on cuisines. I love the Zomato app as it has helped me survive in a city far from home.,5
Great service . I am impressed with the fast delivery and for good customer support. I ordered one food stuff from Zomato but restaurant had sent me wrong food stuff . I approached for customer support and in very short time period i got my refund . Thank u Zomato . Really impressed .,5
"customer service is very bad in case customer makes payment online and order gets cancelled, there is no chance that they will leave you so dont make online payments and their discounts are just to attract people where regular fees of hotel will be the same after discount. zomato charges 23% margin from hotels and extra taxes and delevery charges from customers.",1
"Very bad service and very unsupportive costumer service, personally I am suggesting swiggy, best ever app than zomato . I ordered Chicken noodles and veg noodles from zomato with 100rs cashback promo name was TASTY , order was confirmed and executive was assigned ,later on they cancelled the order and I didnt got my refund. I was waiting it for more than 1.5 hrs and I am totally disappointed with this app.",1
"crappy app and worst support system. App tells you transaction failed and please try again, money deducted will be refunded and when you retry they place the order twice and won't refund, moreover their crappy support system will try to justify their wrong doing. Buggy and crappy app.",1
What a magnificent brilliantly worst app,1
"Terrible Service in Peripheral Areas. They have expanded to the peripheral regions, however, the restaurants would take 40-50 minutes to make bloody momos! Their delivery executives will not come up to the flat, they charge Rs 40-50 delivery charge even when no rain is there. It's disgusting. Pathetic service.",1
"If the merchant does not have the ordered, paid item. Merchant calls to say cancel from my end, because he cancels, he has fine. I tried cancel in App chat does not allow me to type and gives me a button to call merchant. Merchant gives me a number and says this is Zomato support. Zomato support says ask merchant to cancel...or wait till delivery time is up...i the customer decides to wait hungry because where i am you are the only app...i guess i have to find a better way for food online.",1
"Isn't a reliable app. Shows restaurants as open and accepts the order. The restaurant doesn't comfirm it tor a long period. On inquiry they inform that the restaurant is closed. Well, this information is passed almost after an hour. Unacceptable behaviour.",1
"Horrible experience! If you are ordering from zomato, be ready to pay for the food you didnt receive. The service is horrible. The delivery executives dont even try to reach out to you and just mark your order as cancelled because why would he put the effort if you are paying for the food!",1
"It takes a bit of hunting for a Gold restaurant, but I was able to recover my annual membership fee in just a couple months. it would be great if I got notifications on nearby Gold restos.",4
"Worst experience..i ordered food item. I wasnt delivered and cancelled without any confirmation. there help line messenger, says the number was not reachable.irony is that i received jus one call on the munber and secondly i was busy on the other call, so there is no chance of being not reachable.money not refunded nor order delivered.when asked them to share their call records confirming that they made multiple calls. They dont make any replies and jus say, deeply regretted ,feel sorry for you.",1
"Sickeningly frustrating that each time u open the app u need to set the location. Dumb app cant remember last location, nor any way to set a default address. Search results come up from all corners of d city unless u choose the address or set d location. As it is zomato trying to b an all in one app takes getting used to and now this.",2
"Worst experience and support i got from zomato. some of the items from my package were missing and I didn't get the bill. When i called the zomato boy again for the missing item he didn't pick the call. Never pay in advance for your order ever, if u do so u will have to face this kind of issue. never gonna use this app again. Swiggy and uber eats are better.",1
the worst and unprofessional app I have ever used it's they charge u penalty instead of refunding they didn't even deliver the food if asked again they don't work in coordination they don't give proper and satisfying reply they just keep on saying it's the policy in order to make profit it's simply the worst application I would suggest better to cook at home then to use it,1
"It use to be a good app, now if you select a location it doesn't show restaurants near it, it shows randomly any restaurants. This makes it very difficult to find a nearby restaurants. I wonderful app was brought down... By themselves... Please connect if there are any good apps available...",1
irresponsible behaviour from the stuff. After mentioning proper address and location the delivery person can cancel prepaid order according to their own wish and the customer care support team is worth less. never going to order from this site again. I suggest to all the people out there if they actually care for their money and time plz never use this app.,1
"Customer support is very poor, Bot is provided with limited pre defined question, if Bot not able to answer session is ending there. Because of system glitch delivery boy went in different direction, and I don't no good and no refund. Useless app Customer care is so rude when they called.",1
"Pathetic service. Facing a lot issues these days. Order gets cancelled after an hour , sometimes valet not assigned till hour. And that chat with us option is for name sake . Does not solve the issue on time niether reply on time . Disgusted with service today",1
I had really bad experience with the Zomato... I have ordered for food and we cancelled it.. but they have deducted 750 rs for me. When I checked with the support team they said they don't have options to refund or return our money.. They will try to convince me that next time they will give best service but. About money only one response don't have options to return the money.. Be careful people before ordering food check multiple times..,1
"The most pathetic food ordering app. The associated restaurant not only rejected my order but even denied refund. While the chatbot in app says that refund has been initiated, i am yet to see it reflect in my account after 18 days. It speaks volumes about the lack of ethics at Zomato and they seem to increase their topline through such fraudulent means.",1
"When a suggested Restaurant is selected, no branch details shown. And order gets placed to a farther branch while the same reataurant has a branch a few mtrs next to me. Delivery time is horrible for most of the restaurants. And Zomato will throw a 5 bucks tip in ur account to keep you happy while you are starving more than an hour due to a delayed delivery.",2
"The new update is the worst I find. May be it has a better interface but it is practically the most useless update. No features to mark ""been there"" for restaurants. The restaurant walls seems to be more disorganised than before. The foodies level got discontinued... Poor very poor",1
The shittiest customer service on this planet. The responses you get from their employees are epic failure examples. Cant find a option to attach screenshots. They deliver food with full spillage and then ask you to send an email with pictures to resolve the issue. Then they ask time of 24 hours and never reply again.,1
"The app should keep a track on the delivery services provided by their partners. They suck at it, they only deliver when they have more number of orders from the particular area. And if you reach out to Zomato, they say we are unable to reach the restaurant. Then why do you even have partnership with such restaurants?",1
"Not helpful at all. I understand they have a good reputation. But the food I ordered never arrived. And zomato help were unable to reach the restaurant. When I asked them to cancel the order and give me a refund, they tell me they can't until the restaurant gives confirmation. And it had already been more than 3 hours so basically they're suggesting we wait all night until the restaurant confirms.",1
Very good service 👌,5
High rates compared to all competing apps. Zomato Gold is completely useless. All prices of items are higher than other similar platforms and the free items in zomato gold have reduced quantity(half) than if you order normally. Zomato support said that quantity of items depends on the restaurant. We can write a review about less quantity.,1
I have tried to place order and did the payment but after entering otp the time out error occurred and amount is deducted from my account and my order did not get placed. I called the restaurant but they didn't get any order confirmation or cancellation notification and they have the worst customer service 😡😡😠😠,1
very pathetic service. time n again i have experienced problems with their service. ..... its lke order the food...make payment and then forget. Zomato also forgets that they have to deliver the ordered food. and when you ask aboit the order. they say sorry! the restaurant is unresponsive we regret the inconvinience caused. we are adding some credits to your account. to hell with your credits. when a person is hungry he doent want credit.... he just want the ordered food. pathetic service.,1
"Your service is good but, some restaurants like Empire restaurants are sending too much less quantity of food, Chilli chicken I was ordered, but they sent only one small piece of chicken, they are cheating to customers and Zomato also, packing is good but food quantity is too much less",4
The dineline doesn't show my areas of expertise anymore. It only shows the places where I am getting there. This has become a real pain to search even my own reviews nor have I seen the experts tab anymore on other's profile. This is a Food rating app first!! We are food bloggers and tend to search places and review them on zomato rather than just online ordering! Stop ruining the first thing that you were incorporated for or change the apps name to just food delivery.,1
"Please fix your refund policy. You have credited me with some credits for an ommission of an item in my order. Then the credits, expired with in 2 days. What was my fault here? Why did I loose my money? Plus have a call center where we can address these issues. Simple chat service is not solving the purpose.",2
"Worse food delivery app ever. Today i paid online and when the zomato valet came i could not pick up his call for sometime then he rejected my order and went away. So i will not get refund.Don't they have google maps on there devices...Very bad experience and also they don't deliver at your door step, you will have to keep searching for them.",1
rate is very high...if i buy it from resturant i just get at just half price from zomato..and if my distance is just 10 metres also...they take 20 rs. delivery charges...i am going to delete this app...they doesn't allow cancel order option also...swiggy is much more better than zomato.. i don't want to give one star also...,1
"Horrible horrible delivery and service. They take the order, take the money, and don't deliver. They promise that the money will come back after 5-7 working days. They do not apologise for any and all mistakes that may happen from their end. And they are just not bothered about the customer. They do not have any superiors in the call centre or chat centre who could resolve issues or one can speak to. Don't bother waiting for food to come if you order from them, because in most probability they will not deliver. You may be lucky if they deliver your order. Also don't expect someone to resolve your query if you face a problem.",1
Swiggy is Best!! I have ordered several times but everytime i get the estimate like food will be delivered in about 20 min but it will take more than 80 min for that. The GPS system is even bad to track the delivery guy.,1
Unistalling the app.. Worst customer service. They don't care about customers once order is delivered whether it is good and not even eatable. They can't replace the order and they can't give you refund that is making fool of customers and what they will answer we are sorry for inconvenience this won't repeat again. Great they are done.,1
I ordered food and its being 1 hour still the agent is 35 km away. Payment done and no option to cancel the order...... sick.......,1
Zomato food is so delicious.😋😋,4
very bad service.. they penalise you with full order amount if you cancel your order....even immediately after you put your order.... very funny you put penalty on prepaid order what if some one put cash on delivery order and during delivery cancel their order then that's ok... but prepaid order you penalise the user... I lost 200 rs with you and I cancel my order immediately after placing it because it was a wrong order.. neither I get food nor money.. that fair... not really zomato...,1
"App is very bad from past 2 weeks I am not able to order anything everything is grade out, where as at the same location my friend is able to order, disgusting customer chat support as well waiting for response from past 25 mins... Disgusting app disgusting customer service... Highly disappointed this is how they treat their "" zomato gold customer""",1
I would honestly recommend Zomato to anyone but their recent policy of deep discounts feel a bit harsh especially on local establishments. On the client side of things it is very good and I would like a map feature to be added so you can see restraunts near you on a map.,4
Waste app they took money and they give different food if raise any complaint they cannot solve the problem they will say silly silly reason ordering the food in zomato is waste of time and waste of money dooo orders in swiggy. Swiggy is best app,1
this app is rubbish seriously. i ordered pizza from dominos through zomato. i paid in advance through google pay. but then i get a call from dominos that zomato doesn't delivers their service and the cant deliver in my area. I tried reporting this in app. They are telling me that its not their concern about my money. asking me to call dominos. why does your app gives option to order if you cant take responsibility for that order. Making fool out of customers. Wasting out time and money.,1
"I wish there was an option to give a zero or negative rating. got partial order, tried to contact customer care by chat helpline does not bother to reply. didn't get invoice either. This is heights of poor customer service and management.",1
Food delivery done best. Simple desktop interface and user-friendly app work perfectly to ensure you are connected at all times. Very very supportive staff to handle any rare mishaps. Prompt response and action on queries posted via chat. Amazing deals on offer all the time. We just love ZOMATO!!😊👍,5
I have ordered pizza from dominoes using this app and i have used the code NEW50 and after using the code i didn't get the discount and payment was made. Paymet was fully deducted from my account without giving the discount and now the app is not working properly. Even customer care is not reverting back,1
"This app has been the saviour for all the public here. people who don't usually express it,but it has act as the time saviour for us.one would have not ever expect this kind of food service would also be available.And it has been possible all because of this ZOMATO food service.life has been more convinient and feasible after this service has been come out in public.I personally love the service you provide,which is quick as a count.the best food service app i have come across through till date",5
more than DILEVERY 👬 doesn't find out our delivery point but I also used to pointed Google maps.. they don't track me also zomato live tracker status is Very slow.. within more of restaurant didn't give a fresh food it also use Heighbread food which is harmful for us.. Also zomato tells us that 5times use 50% discount but not is true as well as when we ordered online 💰 via used promo code (upi payment) its give discount but not give cash back but it have mention about cash back. that's all,2
I am not able to see Zomato Pro in my App,5
"My experience with zomato was always good till I made an order with Domino's through zomato. Though zomato shows Domino's as one of their partners in the app, it is just a fraud to cheat the customer. Zomato is not providing any order tracking facility for Domino's order saying that it is impossible as the order is delivered directly by the Domino's agent. My order was delivered 1 hour late than the agreed time. The worst part was that neither zomato nor Domino's were taking the responsibility.",4
Pathetic customer service. I got a burger missing and chat support asked me to email to customer service. And disconnected my chat and were lying that they were unable to contact the restaurant whereas I connected with them immediately. Please don't order and will uninstall the app if I don't get a reply...,1
"Waste service, after placing an order sometime later restaurant says ordered item is not available.... If we again check the items it will be available in the restaurant menu list...... This service has to take care of unavailable items to highlight or mention as not available",1
Money has been given online but this is second time food has not been delivered,1
"They don't able to fulfill their commitments and worthless service provider and useless chat service , and most importantly not able to take responsibility of customer , don't try zomato , pachtaoge",1
"good app just there is location problem, it was not able to detect exact location..i placed order in cafe vivo..order was changed because there was unavailaibility of order ...yet i had to pay amount of original order which was lesser than actual order ..guys if this happens to you cancel the original order and place another order",4
The customer relation of Zomato is really bad.This is my personal experience. I have deleted this app.If the restaurant accepted order on this app they cancel it.Once we ordered from a restaurant which was open during night time and after waiting 2 hours there comes a call that they won't b able to deliver. But if we by mistake are not at home at have placed order then they won't cancel it. I believe there are better options than Zomato.,1
I had the filthiest experience ever..waiting for my order for the last good damned hour. There is nobody in zomato chat. Last 15 minuits they are providing me the wait time of 1 minute for chat support. Restaurant is not picking up my call. I have never faced this with swiggy ever. Never going to order from here again.,1
This is very bad food ordering app first accepts the order and after half an hour sends message saying we have cancelled the order. Donot order anything here waste of time and money and customer support also sucks not able to provide a resolution to problem only thing they know to say sorry for the inconveniences caused......,1
My first delivery had a damaged packaging. N now i ordered again n its been almost an hour i didnt get my delivery. The delivery guy said there is a app problem he cannot recieve the order because his app is not working. Worst app and worst advertising that food will get delivered in 30min n bla bla bla. Ubereats was better than this.,1
they don't refund your digital money... the worst part about this app is it accepts the digital payment and if the restaurant is not able to make the dish and delivery then they won't refund your money... I have complaint many times but they don't respond... even if u contact them on their website they don't respond,1
"There is bug in app.. Every time i open, after sometime it shows none of restaurants taking orders, after unisatall and install again. All restaurant taking orders. Just i had order some food and now its again showing none restaurants taking orders. They should look as most of us will think app is not working.",2
"getting so fed up with their consistency. Thank you for providing a means to order food online but you have let yourselves go with alot of carelessness. So many late deliveries even though as soon as i order or a few minutes later, i get a notification saying your order is ON ITS WAY....Total BS. Is this to improve your KPIs ? alot of deliveries have missing items...i contact customer service and i get fake promises....when you started out you were pristine. What happened now?? go back plz!!!!",2
"Such a worst experience I had with the app. Not option to change the items or cancel the order. On requesting to the care, the decline to cancel the order just after placing order within 30 second they declined to cancel the order.",1
Took back the positive stars .Aweful experience with this app .no one cares and replies your query about prepaid orders.hours after still the order confirmation is pending. Dunno where to complain and cancel and get my money back. These guys are looting money with out delivering beware and stay away from Zomato.Dont trust the positive reviews they get disappear soon.Trust me guys really worst experience.,1
these guys are frauds and idiots. worst experience ever. i had ordered food. the valet did not call me and then i got the msg as you are not available at the mentioned address we have cancelled and imposed the whole amount as cancellation fee. while i tried to call back no response either from chat or in call.,1
"Its really horrible experience, we ordered food on 1.am, the distance is minimum from the restaurant, but we got our food on atlst after 2.30 hours, when can see that the delivery guy has started from the restaurant on time... He took so many orders, and the zomato app still showing the wrong time, , we feel harrased...",1
If there was a negative rating I would have done it. Guys this people are least interested in your concerns. They charge you for their mistakes and when you ask them about it they say we tried connecting you but you were not in network. Humble request if your are using this than don't ever make a prepaid payment as the restaurant does not conform the order even after 45 mins.,1
No offers and cheating by name of Zomato gold. No refunds are providing. Customer service people are using bad words.,1
"For a prepaid order for lunch, these guys delivered an incomplete order. Plus their attitude towards customers is aweful. They said will only refund the amount, that too to zomato wallet, not the original payment mode. With this kind of experience, I would never want to order from zomato. What would I do with stupid zomato wallet credits?",1
Very good service,5
worst app and worst customer service these guys cancel order if we don't pick the call then there's no purpose of address column. mostly anyone order food online bcz they are busy at that moment to go to restaurant atleast they an add an alternative mobile number column while placing order so that order canellations will get reduced very disappointed,1
"Very poor quality of delivery service but delivery rates are high. I found hair in my food, and i complained about it, to the Zomato customer service, but they didn't bother to say a sorry, infact they haven't responded to my complain. At last i had to throw my food. That day, i starved during the lunch. And they haven't refunded or compensated for my loss.. but i am their regular customer. I use this app frequently. So, i expected a good behaviour from them. Poor customer service",2
"Worst App. No accurate Information. Waste of time and payment. At the last moment they say ""mam aap kisi dusre outlet se manga lijiye, aapko refund ho jaega agle do din me"". Hunger killed, Time wastage full on. Too much disappointed. If this goes on with other customers also, Ur App will shut down gradually. And it should.",1
"Customer support function not working, ie no one to help when things go wrong - which of course is what happens. Edit: Seems to be working now, temporary issue or software bug, not sure.",4
I will suggest all to switch to Swiggy after facing this problem. I am a new customer to Zomato and I have been provided the promocode ZOMATONEW for the first five orders but the code only worked for first order. As talked with the agent he asked me to place the order without applying promocode and they will refund me the amount. I have placed my fourth order but they haven't yet refunded me the amount. Moreover their customer support services are really very poor. They don't reply to my message,1
Amazing app. I used to use Swiggy for getting my food but since last few months their delivery was extremely poor. Hence I switched to zomato. Loving the app since then. So many options and delivery is always on time!,5
delicious test wonderful presentation yummy 🤤😋😋😋,5
"Can you please add an option in which we can customize the the thread in ""my order"" list in case we want to repeat it with a little tweak in the items. Thus, no need to do the same order again to remove the drink for example! Further, the repeated order can be recorded in *my order* list in a separate thread including the tweak. Thiswise, we can have more detailed quick options for future repeating if you know what I mean?",5
"during my latest order,i was not given time or option to apply available coupon.no time was given to cancel my order.Even payment was done automatically from my linked wallet with out my permission.very bad experience.cant even get a chance to chat and complain.they always appear to be busy.A lot has to be done to improve the app.",1
worst app. it cut my money after order cancellation and not refund my money. worst services. zomato told me to get my order in 30 minutes .but it already had 50 minutes. but my order didn't come to me...then i call delivery man.he told me to come in 30 minutes. and he not placed my order but zomato showsy order has placed. .. so i cancelled it. then my money not refunded by zomato. i will tell this everybody.. one customer has a power. to grow down a company.,1
Editing the review earlier given 5 star and positive feedback...... But now having one of the worst experiences post zomato had taken over Uber Eats.....may be it's the unpreparedness to handle a big customer base....whatever.....customer care doesn't responds on time.....orders getting cancelled.....valet side app not working leading to delays and many more reasons.....,2
Just pathetic customer service. My order took almost 2 hours and still its hasnt been delivered. when i was continously calling restaurant and agent all they cud say is 5min 5min. i literally had to sleep without eating food. what is the epic part we spent money when it comes to refunding procedure.,1
Order placement is ok. Tracking / cancelation is a mess. Food rating doesn't reflect reality. So is restaurant ratings. If you take money instantly and refund only after seven days. Will you accept if we pay for our order after seven days.,1
Very good service,4
Worst service and the customer care is not really helpful and the executives are not good... They cancel the order just if we don't pick their call for first time only and when we call back they keep the phone in not reachable and they say it's our mistake and finally we don't get food as well as the money also back.... When we ask the customer care they say only one answers as no refund and it's not possible... They eat our money and cheat us....,1
I was a big big zomato fan and always promoted it too.. but since many restaurants and pubs have opted out of the zomato gold and with the new silly zomato gold rules.. it's kind of sad.. Also I have noticed that the rating has become fake so many poor restaurants have been rated high to improve their sales.. Just very sad state of events.. had expected better from zomato..,2
"bad experience. if any user choose wrong iten in order, and placed the order, or within seconds user cancel the order before order confirmed from restaurant, zamato penalty all amount of your order...this is very wrost thing in Zamato service.or they will not refunded the amount back ( waste of money without getting any food)",1
"My one stop food solution - Zomato has always been a good experience when it comes to food order & deliver, they also offer good discount schemes when compared to other food aggregators. The wide variety of payment option also adds to ease and convenience.",5
there should be a option before ordering of the food.... like an option to confirm your order or something like that..... bcoz sometimes... we mistakenly click on the order button.... and you guys then dont refund the money on cancellation within seconds of the order placed,1
Very bad experience. cancelled two consecutive orders. Now their executive says will refund money in next 3 to 7 days. Money is not a matter but what about the service. What about costumers trust. Wanted to give 1 star but gave 2 for previous experiences. Will suggest to please tie up with reliable restaurants. Dont go on tying with anybody just to increase reach and business.,2
It's worst app I have ever seen to get the invoice for the order . I have been asking invoice from the day I have ordered but after 8days zomato support saying they couldn't get the invoice for the order and asking me to contact the restaurant. I have done the payment to online then why I need to ask the restaurant that's also after a 8days.,1
"While ordering food online, it does not list all the banks for netbanking. Why such limited option, when I don't face this issue for any other app? Also, off lately while searching for nearly outlets or by cuisine, the results are strange. It has been acting funny off lately...",2
thanks zomato for being my mother when m hungry....this app really changed the things...no pain of cooking all the time...no massive delivery charges....grt discounts...i really appriciate those who got the idea of food delivery like this...otherwise only boring dominos pizza was the only option..now i can odr anthing of minimum amount even...thankssss..u deserve..plz nvr disappoint,5
"Pushes a notification to wake up in the morning ""Rise and shine, order breakfast"" which I absolutely hated. It makes me angry that the app developers think that they can decide when I should wake up. One star.",1
"its osm , delievery is very fast with good services & in case of any problem custumer support is really good they reponse immediately , sometimes delievery is too late or sometimes app is not working properly or sometimes when we ordered from some restaurant they switch off at the time of order faces small problems but all over experience is very good problems comes but the custumer support solves all problems on the support , so atlast i give 5 out of 5",5
The food is not delivered properly and it got spoiled. When I chat with them they ask question if they want compensation but there will be no option to select yes. Really worst. This happened more than a few times,1
"i just had a problem with some of my order and hence tried to call their customer care number but couldn't find any response!!!....😔😔 so was disappointed ...and even its written, that you would get 10% paytm cash back but they dont even give that , and when you ask for it , ..they just give it in ZOMATO CREDIT..!!... even their application is not working properly, just shows try again.... EVERYTIME.... WORST app!!!.",1
I had a really bad experience with zomato. I had order food from some restaurant and paid the money online after some time I got a notification saying the order has been cancelled fine I'm not concern about it but then they still didn't even refunded my money simply I'm getting an email saying that the money has got credited in my source account but I have not yet got it and it's been more than 2 weeks now. This is not the first time every time there are doing the same things.,1
really poor app....you cannot relay on the their delivery man.... whenever they want they used to cancel our orders and give really poor excuses that they have tried to reach our residence but we didn't have accepted it...no mechanisms to resolve the issue....THEY WILL ASK YOU TO MAIL THEM AND THEN I WOULD BE WAITING FOR 24- 48 HOURS.....IN SHORT YOU CAN'T TRUST THE APP THEY WOULD BE DELIVERING UR ORDER OR NOT.... HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE..,1
"I don't face much troubles, but I came across some issues related to restaurants categorized under promotional discounts but the promo code is not there. So you spend some time choosing that meal then you don't find the promo code at checkout even though it shows the restaurant is rinning a discount promotion using a code.",4
My payment get failed. But my order delivering to me without any notifications. And then amount debited from my account. And getting notifications after food delivered. My angry is that I can't able convey the problem to customer care. Damn autobot keep asking the same questions. How to you expect customers to reply for that?,1
"Worst customer support I have ever experienced. Firstly they don't have any contact number, you can only report your concerns by using the chat assistance which is not quite helpful. They miss communicate things and later on they will foolishly say sorry we can not help you in this regard. So if you will face any problem related with the refund or any other I'm not sure they r going to help you. Just for this reason i uninstalled this app.",1
"its a great app. from my opinion its better than swiggy or uber eats. zomato always giving coupans . Now zomato30 is running . customer service is also very good , if food not good or have bad taste or it is not cooked well or delivery late ,they are giving all services. i am always used this app for order my food. today i have order something from zomato , food is very bad ,then zomato customer service associate arrange another meal at the same price that i have paid earlier OR 2nd order free",5
worst service ever Never received a support on any request I have raised. The restaurants provide wrong order and Zomato is not able to respond to the queries of the customers. I raised an issue and it's been two days already still they have not provided any response. I would rate Swiggy way better than Zomato Don't use this app,1
This is worst application for online food ordering... They are not giving refund as order is rejected by merchant... I am continues following executive for refund but they told refund initiated by them and credit in my account in max 5 working days but till today not received any amount and zero response and also not giving customer care number... I am giving zomato negative -5 ratings...,1
I like your customer support but the add (+) button on dishes in restaurants doesn't work in order. It's all I require to be working to order on that screen and not working makes the app non-functional for me. even restarting hasn't helped.,3
"Please start oxygen home delivery right away.You have the network.You have the resources.Food delivery can wait,the country needs oxygen refilling service at home with immediate effect .",1
"The delivery executive Sriram is a thief, who steal food as a dog. Not reliable app Dear team zomato  Please ref my order to buhari hotel through your app.  Though I received the order well in time,  I was dismally surprised to see that none of the food packages were properly sealed and in one package there was just 30% of the quantity ordered.  wise men learn from others experince while fools learn by their own . I heard that zomato  people steal food enroute, today I experienced it.",1
"Zomato pls ask your customer service to talk in a proper way. I was confused about something, basically wanted to check if we can place order in advance. The information was not available so I tried placing and order just to see if I can enter future time for the delivery. However the app placed my order and there was no option to place an advance order. So I started chating with customer care and they told me it is not possible. So I cancelled the order by calling the restaurant. This happened i",1
Worst experience.... my order is running hell lot late..... i cant find any proper option to complain or take action....... Swiggy is far better in terms of support...... Its been almost 1.5 hours I havent received my order I click to cancel order app directed me to contact restaurant..... its pretty obvious no restaurant will do that...... pathetic app.....,1
Customer support is not at all good. They don't even cancel order when they can do it immediately before it starts preparing. They wait for sometime then they say that order has been preparing if you could you told us earlier we could have done something.. Should tell them to cancel order before placing.. I mean they just find passage just not to cancel a order. Real dissatisfied with them,1
"If the delivery boy is unable to contact with you then you will be charged for the cancelled order... My personal experience...last night i ordered my food from a restaurant, the delivery boy didn't called me neither he rang the door bell, he cancelled my order and I was charged for that cancellation from the restaurant... I suggest please don't install this app this is the worst app",1
There is lots of difference between online and offline food of resturent,2
App doesn't have cancel option and most of the time order goes to wrong address. this issue is repeating Everytime i order .. people out there please don't install this app as they are mainly into stealing food and money rather than delivery 4 out of 5 orders going to wrong address.,1
"Zomato shows item price more than the store's menu and later they give discount which doesn't make difference but, I don't get to leave home, place order and wait for food when I can have it on my fingertips because of this app. Lovin it.",5
"I am zomato customer was quite happy with it but nowadays it is a very bad service which is provided which forces me to come here and write, what has happened to zomato support items are missing from the product, whom to tell to your robotic support doesnt understand it I recieved half of my order. Previously I recieved stale food from a restaurant whom to complain?? Your robotic suppport says feedback has been taken and will be submitted to restaurant. I want my order properly.",1
Superb good service,5
"What a horrendous app with such poor delivery partners. My order was not fulfilled after delivery boy refused to deliver it, after fighting with me. He asked for the address (it was across the street from where he was standing) and wouldn't let me get a word in. Then he began arguing with me. Then he hung up and cancelled my order. I got no notification, I didn't get a refund either. Such a poor app",1
I have ordered twice from this app but my experience was extremely pathetic both the times.For my first order some of my order didn't arrive and for my second order the cooking instructions were not followed by the restaurant and it took 1 hour to deliver the food and the Zomato support does not take any responsibility for these things which is something discussing as well as frustrating!,1
So many issues with the support. Assign Valets who aren't even available and the customers are left wondering where is the order. Also doesn't seem like they are interested in solving issues on time for better service. Extremely misleading.,2
I tried to book order and the order was not processed but my money was deducted. Customer service was not at all helpful and they were repeating the same lines whenever i chat with them. I wish to provide 0 star if there was an option available,1
"This application does not help for vegetarian eaters. Sometimes when selecting veg option, application add chicken as by default option, you would have to go and change the items from combo. I just searched for veg option and ordered one combo and I got chicken in it. I offered that to delivery person to eat.",1
"please enable a comment box for a ordered restorent so people can write their exp about the food 🍴🍕🍔. How people can get to know about the taste, by the stars? 🤣 they only know by the comments about the food. Others should not suffer the same. rest offer one is super but still each have to spend min 140/- so think about it",1
Nice app. There are some great restaurants and food choices here. The non-vegetarian choices are especially good but sometimes unavailable (at least as far as my area is concerned).,4
"I have to change my review here, I had terrible experience just now, order something from GoGourmet restaurant and I did not get it even after 2 hours, when I contacted customer care this guy with madeup name Anos was wasting my time, repeating same line again and again. it is so frustrating and also when I asked for my refund he/she stopped answering me. Horrible experience.",1
Waste app...location is not tracking accurately there by saying order can't be delivered....1 star becoz no negative stars available,1
"Worst experience not at all recommended doesn't care for it's customers at all. This is the worst food ordering app. Please make sure no one orders from it. Doesn't even deserve a single star, deserves rating in negative. No proffesionalism at all, I would recommend not even Install it, I commited the mistake and I don't want anyone to experience what I experienced.",1
"If you want to test lots of bugs and crash of this App. then order food on Sunday@8PM, The app start crashing like never before on every Sunday Night. Zomato servers are not able to catch high demand, They really need to look at this issue urgently.",1
"i had wrongly ordered some food which ai wanted to cancel...but there was no option to do so... I had to take the order unwantedly... Bcoz the ca centre guy called me and said if u cancel the order now, it will be deducted from the next purchase. And even after a complaint from email, no action from the Zomato was taken. Really Disappointing",1
"The food is nicely packed most of the times. i just wish that there would be pictures of what we want to order, and also no. of pieces provided in dishes of (chicken or paneer).overall, I love this app.",5
"Very worst experience, i order in zomato @1230 hrs but the order delivered @1405 hrs. Even though instead of zomato the hotel i ordered deelivered the item. Then what is pupose for ordering the item. I suggesting dont use the zomato. They charged me the delivery charge too. Look zomato i am giving money for delivery charge for timely delivery. You getting my money but order not delivered by the time means what is the purpose of u. Who ever see review don't order in zomato.",1
"When the Zomato is different and Uber eats is different platform untill everything is alright but when the zomato purchase Uber eats then there is problem occuring in food quantity , food quality,food delivering System. Everything seems goes wrong you must improve this issue otherwise I will uninstall the app and gave you also bad feedback. Please resolve this issue as soon as possible,Uber eats was very good Food delivering app but if you purchase the Uber eats then you must have to maintain.",1
"Whenever i'm hungry, it just takes me 2 min to place an order for my usual take out from KFC. 10 min later the same take out is at my doorstep. You also get the live location of the delivery man with a small scooter icon on the map. This app is just brilliant.",5
"pathetic service. they will neither deliver on time, nor cancel the order. no matter what issue you have with the food, however bad the quality is you are never getting any refund. neither can they make sure that the food is good and exactly what you order. use swiggy or uber eats...much better",1
"Zomato has been failing on delivery and service xonstantly for me. Almost 80% of time orders are delayed by more than 30 minutes. Also, zomato help instead of providing better experience and improving just provide some redund as they call it token of apology. This feels even worse.",2
Only online payment acepting and next thing restaurant which response not,1
the worst app I have seen. even though I have not ordered anything they tell you have ordered and simply block the account for no reason and they don't have the patience to resolve or check whether that accusation is true. worst app experience. I would rather stay away from this app and advice others to do the same.,1
Horrid experience. it takes 1 hour to complete the order at noon.. the API's keep failing.. something went wrong.. try again is like their damn default mode. has happened multiple times and they cant find a way to fix it.. go to swiggy.. horrid checkout experience on Zomato,1
The app is pretty messed up. Its crashing left right and center. I have placed an order and the status is unknown. The support staff is saying that they are facing technical glitch. worst experience.,1
"Need to improve more.. Able to order but details are missing. Have ordered pizza, but just ordered blondly, no options given, no information about that pizza, medium or large not mentioned.. Found its larze pizza only after receiving it. And my second order.. price diff between Take way & zomato order is 35rupees.. not a big difference and no use of the offer code. If no offer code, then I could have paid 65 rupees extra. So, sorry I dont like much.",2
Zomato is not safe for Online payments. I have made a Debit Card payment for food. Then from the next day I'm daily getting OTP for the payments. They're selling our data or using themselves.,1
"App UI is not user friendly at all. About restaurant reviews, plenty of reviewers. Zomato can act as a good restaurant reviewing medium. But when it comes to food delivery, the worst one out there. Customer service is almost non existant. Keeps getting worse with time. Totally disappointed.",1
My experience and expectations are very bad with my some previous orders... And when I reported they said they do not have control over the quality and quantity given by the restaurants... They once gave me a refund but after that they've stopped showing any of there concern over my queries ... I guess swiggy is far better than Zomato... They have literally decreased there quality of service...,1
quality of food varies on incremental orders from same partner. like bhatinda junction we ordered twice . the second order quality was not like first one. The app crash like anything. The delivery charges are are on very higher side . Example 138 food attarcks 60 delivery charges.,1
"The app is great. Good offers but the delivery guys ruin your experince, they wont even use the gps marker to come. They will constantly call you to enquire about location etc. even before starting moving from the restaurant. Very annoying.",3
"Pathetic Service!! 1.Order was accepted by the restaurant lately 2. Zomato Wallet was assigned very late 3. Two times the delivery personnel was changed 4. When I was trying to cancel the order because of such late Service, I was forced to not do so by penalising me via Cancellation fee of the amount equal to the order!! WILL NOT REFER ZOMATO TO ANYONE ELSE!! WASTAGE OF TIME AND MONEY!!",1
"They will ruin good food with terrible delivery. When you return it and ask for a refund or replacement, they will take the food but won't return your money or replace the order under any circumstances. They'll say ""Please understand"", your clients/guests go back hungry & you end up insulted, with no food or money already paid for the food. Horrible customer care/grievances redressal system...",1
Zomato Delivery service is the worst of the rest... Delivery boys are very rude and lazy. I experienced it personally. Our entire family starved because of zomato's worst delivery service. Swiggy is 100% better than this.. Better go with Swiggy if had a choice... Moreover they will give very less quantity of RAITHA and etc...😂,1
"Activated 1+1 offer by mistake. No revert even if it is not redeemed. Why should I pay for this as I haven't availed the offer. Felt cheated. It sucks. Another cheating by Zomato in 1+1 delivery. The quoted price was Rs 200 higher (difference with actual bill sent by restaurant) than as actually offered by the restaurant. So, there wasn't any actual discount, rather the amount paid for availing the 1+1 offer was looted. Feeling cheated at laughing at myself 😂 by getting tricked by ZOMATO",1
Worst app. They charge so much delivery fee even on small orders. Once you avail the discount they increase the delivery charge and the net amount remains the same. On most orders promo codes arent even applicable. Not reccomended for anyone....,1
Very good service,5
Very good service,5
There's no way to drop a complaint on the app. Chat with us has limited options. There are restaurants which are shut down that appear on the app along wity others causing inconvenience to the customer as well as the valet.,2
"Totally worth it in terms of experience, the offers if they could be more of them would definitely make this app a hit. Love the customer support and the engagement for foodies.",5
Waste app in the ordering food items,1
The app is really good. What's not to like about getting food delivered to you! In any weather there are a number of listed restaurants that still dekiver food to you. My stomach thanks you!,5
The latest update does not let me read reviews. And the app has become so complicated.. The location/address and pictures of the restaurant is also not visible! Please bring back the reviews and other old features.,1
It is that solution I draw towards each time I want to discover a new gastronomical outlet with a difference. the delivery service is outstanding with correct location tracking unlike other similar apps where delivery location is not accurate and creates a menace. keep up the great work and be our Northrrn Star...,5
Delivery is good,3
"It's disgusting when it comes to location, unecesarily asks us to capture loacation when the address is already feed. Should work on location, it should not ask for it again n again as it captures something wrong . Worst experience in terms of location.",1
I have done a order but it cancelled without my consent. I have ordered dinner today. If delivery take so much time then u cancelled directly. Think customer only ordered you after than he will sleep with hunger if you didn't complete the order.😡😡😡😡 So shame less you. And please make sure customer satisfaction is very fruitful for you. Restaurant was Apni Virasat & family Restaurant in Dausa city (Rajasthan). Very cheap services.,1
"I couldn't update the section for places where i have already eaten, i couldn't see the top reviewers and no options to update, the new design is confusing and very frustrating please do something about it, the old design encouraged you to review, thw new update just made things less appealing",1
"Easy to navigate, Huge list of nearby restaurants, but still the price is higher than the actual price of food items available at the shop when I walk in. Also some of zamato delivery boy talks very rudely, delivers wrong food items. sometimes app not works gives unknown error.",3
Whenever I do payment via card... The transaction gets canceled in the first attempt and amount gets deducted and the refund amount is not reflected in account even after 10 days. Its the worst online transaction experience on any apps that I have used.,1
Cant find no star option otherwise i would have opted fr that.. In d last two months i have more than 5 orders that took more than 1 hour to deliver and you guys never even apologized fr d delays.. Swiggy is now paying back money if the delayed orders I heard.. Not sure why you guys take us fr granted.. Should b my last order with zomato after 100s orders .. BTW your support executives r d worst..,1
"Pathetic service by Zomato, online chat help is useless as it never connects to any Agents and they always say to write an email, after emailing and many follow ups also they don't respond so what's the use of having their customer support in place?",1
"Zomato has some best features. It's obviously to give best options for food, you can find out best places to eat nearby, you can book tables for diners without calling the restaurant. It's more like Amazon of food. I am happy with the service.",5
"Ordinary service. Food going down hill now km? Very disappointed in the seafood Sunday lunch. I guess we would have been to this restaurant at least half a dozen times in the last two years. We also visited its sister restaurant ""Town Mouse"" in Carlton several times. Slush arrived with an off Kerosene like flavour. Potatoes 89 ncold. Service was, cool, and aloof.",1
Used to be very good but seems the service has been pathetic off late. ordered today and money deducted from credit card but the order not complete. tried to chat and it stayed on the queu for 30 minutes with no resolution. very bad service.,1
Over all service deserves appreciation. But need to work on time of delivery which suddenly increases when we call the runner after tracking on map to know that where he exactly going.. Ehh!! This is not my location and the runner replies i have multiple deliveries thats why our time is fluctuating. Hope you guys will understand and work on it. 👍👍👍,4
There on time delivery system work on fake system. The charged me Rs. 10.00 per order to assure on time delivery. Further they charged this Rs. 10.00 for that if you dont receive the order on time then you will get back your full refund. In my case delivery is late beyound expected time and tjey denied the refund by mentioning reason that your lication was not correct. My question with Zomato is that if my location is incorrect then how my order is delivered. Support system is time pass.,1
Very Bad Experience.. They take the advance money and deliver half food rest with very bad packing which is not supposed to be eaten. Then if you ask for replacement they take the food back and don't come back and ask to call customer care which is no use only you can get the bill from them nothing else.. Don't Use This..,1
"If you pay by card, 3 out of 5 times your order will somehow get cancelled and they will initiate a refund. They will sit on your money for 7-10 days before issuing the refund.. earning interest on your money. Just imagine.. even if 30 orders a day.. averaging Rs. 200-250 are cancelled.. it is Rs. 6000-7500. Now do the math for a month! All of their promotions are ONLY applicable when you pay by card and who doesn't love Discounts? Masterpiece! Icing on the cake is their pathetic custome support",1
Really really good to have food at the door step.. the only reason i haven't given a 5 star is that sometimes the food looks and tastes cheaper than the restaurant ordered from.. may be the vallet brings it from the footpath with package from the restaurant..,4
"No option to chat with an actual person for complaints. I got a package with seal completely broken. And all that zomato does when I try to complain is throw back a proforma message from a bot. For such a large company, their customer service really sucks!",1
It was a very good app for ordering food untill they cheated on me. I order food worth rupees 1500 and i got less than half of the usual quantity from the restaurant. I wrote a complaint to Zomato and what they did is that they gave me only 100rs as a refund. I had guests at my place and was embarrassed to the extreme. I requested them to give me my refund but in vain. Worst experience of customer support.,1
"Very bad UI. Not working at all, judt shoeing try again everytime. What are the people in zomato doing ? Improve the GUI please, directly show the dishes option, it will help a lot to u guys only. From the depth of my heart, I hate this app",1
location map is not accurate resulting in delivery person missing the location. delivery app is available only in English. it should be available in local languages as well.,1
"Earlier Zomato was good and had very reasonable price but after new update Zomato is charging ""too"" high Tax For eg. If i want to order nything dat cost around 60/- Tax charged 80/- wow!! Now I think SWIGGY is better as compared to delivery and tax charges.. Zomato is looting during Covid situation..",1
"Takes order, confirms it and then doesn't even dispatch it for an hour! I placed my order at 9:02 pm. And it was ""in the kitchen"" for over an hour! And I was asked to wait a little more by the Chat support executive and then he vanished! Seriously. No responsibility whatsoever!",1
"Very handy app, especially for food lovers, has almost all the major franchises available on their map, all those reviews really help in making a good dining experience !!! Offers n discounts are the cherry on the cake 😍",4
Horrible UX. It takes forever to order food. App is too heavy and needs a 'lite' version where only food ordering is facilitated. I'm not at all interested in 'Zomaland' or watching food related content. I just want an app that easily lets me order food.,1
"Can't place an order, neither can apply any coupon.. Been happening for 4 weeks now. Error says payment failed. App is updated till date, cleared cache and stuff. Raised complaints everywhere, now had to give 1star. Pathetically served this time around.",1
"Bug in the app, most of the time shows currently closed for delivery when the shop is already delivering to places. the customer service is horrible at responding. lazy at typing. they don't have even a phone number to immediate contact support. disgusting!!!",1
"it is a very useful app for food lovers like me. it is my go-to app whenever i have foodtrips with family and friends. you can plan ahead where you want to go depending on what you are craving, what you want to order and how much you are going to spend. the menu and photos are very useful.",5
"Hey!! What happened to this app today??? It just shows ""something went wrong please try again later ""!!!!!! It worked normally before but now it just irritates me to the core!! It took me 1hr to place an order😤😤",1
"Many times i didn't get quality food. since, most of the times i have raised complaint to customer care, and chat support but no one is responded properly. No one is trusting customer words. We are paying money with tax but we are not getting qualitative food many times.",1
Worst service from zomato. Used to order food regularly through this app but these people cancelled three of my orders from their end and now they dont even refund my money after so many days of follow up. They make excuses of it that it has been refunded from their end for more than a week I guess. I didnt receive any money after that. Worst experience from all food delivery app.,1
"don't use this app to order the food, food quality is bad, delivery is not on time, pathetic customer support, costly than local market, delivery guys always forcing to customer to collect your order from nearest landmark, you can't modify your order.",1
Awful! So many times the order is accepted but not delivered! like right now .. my order was supposed to reach me at 12.30 am but till now it hasn't reahed its 1am(app shows still preparing food) . Restaurant is unreachable the Zomato Valet is unreachable! You will return me the money in form of credits but i cant eat those credits right! No tech support is ever able to help! all scammers!,1
wow wow wow 🤩🤩🤩🤩 it is a wonderful app im enjoying it very much it has more restaurants then other apps. We just sit back and relax and enjoy our order. The restaurants accept orders very quicky and it has very great offers we get off upto 60% by using some specified promo code. If u have not downloaded this app still then dowbload it fast,5
one of worst customer service ever seen. this company doesn't show the policy in front. they will create the policy instantly. i asked very simple question through cs chat till now no one is replying the same. simply saying we ll help in future. i suggest to each and every customer try to move to other service providers to get better service. also zomato restaurants are not upto the mark compare to other service providers. aw,1
I lost my money and there is no response ever.The worst service and no response from zomato. How much time I have to chat with the customer service representative. Some time the app hangs after the payment successful and there is no response and don't know to whom I have to get in touch. This is the best app to lose your money and if your lucky to place the order spend time chatting with customer service representative.,1
Worst experience swiggy always,1
worst food service app ever. Never had a smooth experience while ordering on zomato.. all order had either one or other problems. Never thought about giving ratings as I knew I'll rate it zero. But today was height as my last order was served with raw)uncooked meat in mutton biriyani. And then bragging that they delivered 6 minutes before time. A real inconvenience.,1
"How can I uncheck this one star also? Please add few more blurbs to your customer service representative references. They all send same old lines. Bored of them.Burnt food, Missing food, Wrong order, order cancelled , everything freaking thing they use same old "" We are sorry about inconvenience, will pass on feedback to restaurant."" Damn you, I can walk directly to restaurant and give feedback if I want to. Atleast try to fix it or stop accepting orders when the item isn't available anymore.",1
"used to be great. i used it for years. has lost it all.worst customer service, habe to keep waiting to chat with someone, orders are late, restaurants turn off their ordering system right as you order. you name it.save yourself the hassle and go for the many competitors",1
Fantastic place for chaat lovers.,5
I placed the order and paid 129. It shows 30 mins time. But do not deliver after 50 mins. And then they cancelled the order and refund only 64.5 and rest deducted as cancellation charges. Really a rubbish service and doing fraund as cancellation charges,1
"This app is so wonderful that, The valet will cancel your order and your money will be in air. And the best part is you don't get food and you don't get your money. and you can't complain, coz there is no one is there to complain.",1
"The app for hosur location needs to undergo considerable improvement, most of the time we find restaurants are unavailable to accept orders when we call and ask they say they actually are available but theres a glitch in the app may be, dats wat restaurant owners say; Hope dat can be improved",3
"Rating this app after using it for more than 3 years. The customer support is one of the shittiest you can ever find. You are delivered wrong items, stale items, after 30-40 minutes of expected delivery time and still they refuse to refund even a single penny!!!",1
Horrible! My order was placed and then cancelled without informing me. The restaurant says the Zomato delivery boys didn't bother turning up. What's the point of ordering through an app if I have to make 10 calls at 10 places and yet sleep hungry.,1
"very bad experience, got. Wrong item,,. Reported it then they suggested to wait for 48 hours... Are u guys stupid? I ordered food to eat now,, not after 2days... And then after 2 days they decided there is no problem. Y the hell do you guys need customer care service if u guys decide whatever u want... Dumbest explanations... Grow up. Learn how to communicate or close down the business. Don't just rob people.",1
"I am really tried off with Zomat, they even don't have customer care service, I think they are doing this intensionally because ever time when I have ordered, some products will miss and I am not able to connect with zomato, if I have asked to restaurante they will say to ask Zomato.......guyzzz plz don't install and use this app, this will really eat your time...",1
"Very bad app they never help with any request and they only apologize for the restaurant issues but never try to solve the issues! also, it's useless to post any special cooking instructions as these ppl will never pass the request to the restaurant... Its always better to call the restaurants directly!",1
"Another new cafe in Nagarbhavi, they have lot of items in there menu.As usual the food and hospitality of Café del sol always been remarkable. The staffs are so cordial and friendly. For sure this place going to be happening and rocking place in this area.Anyways Really I spent a good time here!!Kudos to the entire team of Café del sol....",5
Very disappointed for the first time. The guy couldn't even reach the location which was shown live. And he was complaining that I showed him the wrong location. He just cancelled the order. Please teach you staff to handle GPS. would be really great.,1
Cheapest app ever always give me 50% discount tysm,5
"It was a great app until one of the restaurants charged me way over the bill mentioned in the app. And Zomato team didn't help at all even after providing evidence I guess they are just running away from it, be aware as you may actually pay way more than just what's mentioned in the app!",1
"Your chat service is not responsive most of the time. The restaurants displayed for me don't deliver to my place, they conveniently take and accept the order to cancel it before delivery time, happened twice wasting my time and money.",1
50+ delivery charge for a food order of RS.100/- every single time is hell lot dissapointing . Pathetic system uninstalling the app . Never install back again . 25-35/- is a standard delivery charge but last time i wanted to order a single momo platter and it showed 55/- delivery the platter was of 120/- itself . Pathetic zomato .,1
You can find detailed reviews for restaurants to make informed decisions about food and share your opinion too!,5
"First experience with zomato was not good, since the order was late. But the customer service was excellent and suitable corrective action was taken. Since then all the orders was delivered quickly and the service was good.",4
"zomato is good platform for ordering food and home delivery. However, it does not care about the quality of food served to you. Now restaurants, business owners have started sending foods of lowest quality, prepared unhygienically, expired foods, contaminated food, burnt food etc. When we go to food stall, we unknowingly create pressure on sellers to prepare fresh food and of quality, otherwise we normally take action immediately, but situation has changed now.",1
"Though app is functioning fine, the support system is poor. I don't understand why there is no customer care. There is no option to report delivery related issue and the existing chat supports only billing and referral queries.",2
"As per my point of views...zomato is the best way for eating favourite dishes and also it's will take only 15 minutes so all the person who ordered on zomato so i will request for all the person that if any delivery boy reach your destination few min later as per delivery time so,no one speak some shameless words using for this man because,they will give your food only for 15 minutes and this is not possible if we are made by ourselves in the house so...🙏🙏🙏🙏",5
"worst experience. Ordered dinner at 8.45 pm , did the payment . Called restaurant at 9 pm they told they did not receive any order. Waited for at least 1 more hour but still no update. no customer care number to call at. found one at Google but no one picked. finally I had to make arrangements for dinner at 10 pm which is very risky . what if no other food court was open at that time ? such a customer harassment. And when asked compensation as zomato credits .. no response.",1
I cant order from my id the new update asking to login with email also so I did my entering OTP but it didnt accept. Horrible,1
Very poor service and quality of food delivered is not at all upto the mark. You would end up wasting your money. Their offers and everything else is just a gimmick. I have removed this app from my phone and would never ever install it again.,1
Additional charge is high,1
Good service provided by zomato over the app. Almost every restaurant is using Zomato so its easy to find my favorite food. Delivery is good. Most of all I liked their query resolving and support providing in any misunderstanding. Go for Zomato.!!!,4
This app was very good before now they are worst to reffer to someone and they have improve in user friendly but the older the food you order via this app is having different quantity and packing instead you see the restaurant in this app oder them by call the restaurant direct delivey cause they are canceling the order most of the time .,2
"My experience with zomato was horrible. I had placed an order and the delivery agent failed to deliver on time. I contacted him, gave him directions to my house and yet he could not find my house. After making several attempts, finally i gave up and requested to cancel my order. I was not even given a refund. Overall my experience with zomato has been very bad and i would not recommend this app to anyone. I have tried other food delivery apps and zomato has been the worst.",1
Pathetic services and customer service experience... Ordered from Domino's via Zomato. The order didn't get delivered on time when checked with customer service executive extremely unhelpful.. I don't expect the order I just wanted to know how much more time it'll take. .. Incase you want to know how ask some to connect to me I'll give you all the info,1
Very Good App... its very Convinient to Order Food From The App And Delivery Is always quick. It has Helped me a lot in a new city away from home and The Offers are way too amazing. Deeply Appreciate The Work Of Deepindar Goyal And Pankaj Chaddah and all the co-workers of Zomato. Keep up Your Good Service. All the Best,5
"Though the app seems to have some discrepancies from time to time, it's fairly preferred over competition because of the deals provided on your end.Working up on a few bugs and errors related to the loading of restaurants might just provide it the necessary edge.",3
Food quality need to approve,2
"I have uninstalled and install the updated version but there is no such option to upload my id for wine delivery , and this was happend to me and some more customer and the people seating on telephone and chat have no answer for the problem. This glitch deducted the delivery amount and wine is not deliver due to mismatch id ............worst app and irony is no one knows how to solve it......",1
Unpleasant Experience... Delivery person seem to be irresponsible to get the order check and confirm before accepting the same. What to do if your order is not delivered in full and you have paid in advance.... Wasting of time.... Anyhow feel entire Zomato experience is depend on how your order is delivered....,3
Very good service,5
"I cancelled my gold membership thinking it would stop the auto renewal and I had 7 months left on my gold membership, the customer support didnt allow me to enjoy the gold benefits for the time, i didnt get a refund and nor did they restore my membership. Im disappointed to see that the customer suppoort cannot solve this small problem..Literally feel like i got scammed.",1
Zomato aap has some kind of issue with GPS and maps Accuracy..It always give some wrong directions to the delivery boys.. And then he has to call and ask for the address.. so please fix this issue and it will be a great help for delivery guys.. Thanks and regards.,4
"Kind of disappointed with the excessive taxes and other charges. Earlier the discounts meant something, but now the discounts just provide you off on the taxes and other charges which seems to be so high on only Zomato. Swiggy and Uber eats has relatively negligible ""Tax and Other charges""",3
I would give a negative rating if I could have. I ordered food at around 9pm and I paid for the order. they never delivered the order but marked it as delivered. They made me roam around for food around 10:30pm. They never care about us. Third class operations. It's has been a day but no refund of my money.,1
"Been using this since 2 years ago, when its stil Gold, then your New ""PRO"" Version came out and it straight damn useless, even we paid for it. Tried it in few places over and over again but still failed. Do not launch if your system still half cooked. Fix this before you lose more user.",1
"You have made acc login so difficult with complicated password criteria, I don't feel like login. Other apps are easy and I find more comfortable in using. If Zomato wants to provide bank like login difficulty, its good for them. I will not use it regularly for sure!",2
"Last week two time they taken money for delivery and fulfilled, first time taken the money and they showed it's failed and I requested for the refund it not happened till now, and after that I have paid in the night after that the restaurant was not responding ( fresh menu).",1
Zomato should check quality of food. When we are directly getting foods from respective restaurants then we are getting freshly cooked items but while ordering through Zomato we are not getting fresh foods. It seems like few restaurants are not giving freshly cooked dishes while ordering through Zomato. I have this terrible experience few times while ordering through Zomato. I hope Zomato managers will look after this issue. Thanks,1
Very good service,5
Pathetic service. Food not delivered. Called valet. Valet did not got order information. So ill mannered fellow. No ready to listen. Chat is so slow. Took to much time to respond. Chat took more 30 minutes to cancel the order. Mismanned app. Don't think if Zomato Gold.,1
Worst food delivery app. I paid using Google Pay they deducted my money I mail them showing them the money deduction message from bank and there order screenshot and Everything still my order is not completed and money forget about it obviously. I request everyone not to order from this app using prepaid transaction at any cost because money is anyhow going to deduct from bank but they don't have customer support and they deliberately do this so that you who order using prepaid forget about money,1
"this app is worst , but the problem is they have blocked people for no reasons.they even dont understand what a customer is facing problems.if we do raise issue about late delivery and all they block us for no reason but anyways if you think they can do something big by blocking us then they are wrong, we have others app too like uber, foodpanda and there dealing is the best thn zomato.",1
"very bad customer service. I requested cancellation several times but they didn't reply. finally I called restaurant they said they have not received any order till then. I told him my name and order and told him to wait and hod the order. they also told me that they can't cancel.When zomato replied they said I will charge you because food has begun to prepare, talk to the restaurant. when I called restaurant they told me they have not started yet, so cancel it from app. nothing happened.",2
Very worst experience to get refund.I placed an order in KFC a month ago and still I'm not given refund for which I was promised.I contacted chat support multiple times so far and always they say that they'll refund the money in 5-7working days but that didn't happen..I placed an order of worth 891rs but the whole order was incorrect for which I was promised a refund which I didn't get till date.I placed the order on June 12.No response via email as well..Worst Customer support ever!!,1
"Each time you think their customer support can't get any worse, it does. They'll do everything to make sure they handle an issue as inefficiency as possible, and will waste a lot of your time. And issues happen a lot with them. Do not recommend.",1
App is not even opening and constantly crashing. I tried changing my password and it is not even going to that page. Not expected these kind of performance from app like Zomato where they are not able to handle basic user load and distribute it accordingly.,1
had very worst experience with zomato food delivery. never experienced this kind of experience from them. I made an order at 8.33 pm and it showed me that I will get delivery by 40 mins but finally I got the delivery at 10.28 pm. it was around 2 hours and there was no reply from the zomato team. i was continuesly trying to chat with zomato team but one one replied... even after 2 hours also I got the food packet damaged and still no reply from zomato.... I want you team to contact me immediately,1
Would recommend not to become a GOLD member as more & more restaurants have reduced the serving size to as good as half a plate. It's just a gimmick. Also the many items on the menu are not available for Gold offers. Order normally but dont take GOLd membership is my recommendation.,2
ur customer support sucks !!!! My order which should come in 30 mins took 90 mins and when i tried to cancel it around 60 mins they said that If I cancel it anymore then would get 100 % penalty ! How does it make sense ? In this case the order can take 2 hrs or even 2 years and still i have to suffer loss and can do nothing about it ! I am done with ur app and ur services !,1
THE MOST UNRELIABLE APP I used this app after 10months since uber eats & other apps weren't available... the level of disappointment was unbelievable... firstly i was charged for an order which was paid cod 10months ago and i started to order since 8 and its 12 now... no delivery done yet after 4 cancellations... so if you're hungry is the last app you order from ...,1
Service Quality of the restaurants is falling..The app confirms orders even though the restaurant is closed.. you end up waiting an hour each time with no action being taken by zomato.. only after the time has passed you have to run around zomato to point out the restaurant is not responding and that to refund the amount to u,2
"Poor handling of issues with orders and no way to return bad items in delivery. Zomato doesnt seem to care if food is picked and delivered in proper eatable condition. Support is only through chat (take their own time to respond) and deny replacement of order or refund or even connect with restaurant. Last time we ordered for 400, food was delivered in stale condition and support repeated said we want you to be happy and take 90 credits (~90rs) as a gesture. how is 400rs = 90 credits.",1
Your chat customer service really needs to improve or you should make phone support available again. You cannot reason with your chat support executive since the only logic they have is policy. Your app is great but without proper customer support its pointless!,2
Very high additional charges by way of taxes and additionaly zonato delivery charges too. Disappointing. Also its not contact less delivery at all. Theyy seem to be wearing the same gloves to handover the packages to client directly. This is not contact less delivery.,1
"Not able to talk about the issues which I'm facing with current order, instead we can use the options which they are providing only, which doesn't have the option to talk about current order as well as can't cancel the order... App should provide cancellation option too",1
The app is completely unorganized. Keeps asking me to change my payment method even after I change it. Currently unable to place a food order. Please make this app more user friendly. Just don't keep adding things anywhere.,2
Loved the service 😊,5
"Increases the items rate very very high, plus tax is added plus delivery charges added. It's so unfair to customers",1
"i would have given it a rating in negative if that'd be possible, the food I ordered, it's seal was open. They also refused to deliver the food on previously set location saying that I hadn't set the location. also, they refused to refund my money",1
"Yes , Have been using this app past 3 years in Chennai and Bangalore. Only fault is sudden hike in prices when new coupon code is enabled and also sometimes there is affect in the food quality and temperature. Otherwise a good app to order variety of food even in small outlets present.",4
Worst cancellation policy. Dont even give a minute of time to cancel the order. Sometimes accidentally the order will be placed and they do not give proper order cancellation choice. they cancel the order but wont return money. Poor policy.,1
selfish and arrogant delivery boy.... went back undelivered my ordered item... to my fate ...i thought zomato support would help me oit..but I was all wrong...since they are useless in service providing...the app should consist of an option to cancel the order for atleast 10 seconds after the order. atleast 10 seconds.If the customers orders bymistake.,1
Very good service,5
Very bad experience. I ordered the ice cream from zomata and it was fully melted when i received it. Customer care asked me to share the image of order and i shared it and they said that refund will be processed in my account in next 24 hours. Now it's already been 48 hours and i have not got my refund till now. Customer care are just fooling the customers. Worst experience. It was not expected.,1
Good app for delivery of food but really bad customer service since the chat bots never reply when the is a problem with order. Also they keep showing irrelevant notifications when you ask them for help. Could get better with customer care.,3
"The point behind 1 star is because your unprofessional delivery guys, they don't have manners and ethics for asking address and if they're not able to find your address, they keep arguing, it's better to hire people who are aware of local places apart from that he ask me for the phone, give themselves & the restaurant from which i've ordered the food a 5 star rating and told me that he was confirming my order, after when i eat & go for the rating process it's already rated. what a scamm.....",1
"pathetic... they make their riders carry more than one order at a time and let them decide which order to deliver first. so no matter your order is picked up with in 10 minutes of ordering, but it could still take more than an hour to reach your place, even though the restaurant is only 2 kms away from your place. All because the delivering person is carrying another order. All zomato do in such cases is to apologise but they do not improve their service.",1
"Worst consumer support service ever ......... Didn't refund my double payment to an order. They say mail us and we'll get back to you in 48 hours. .I ordered on 5 th nov, complained on 6th nov and its 14 nov today, still no refund.Gave me a track ID , which is not valid. Hate it and all my pgmates are gonna stop using this stupid app. No reply via email or support chat and even through this review. That's it. That's how they loot people.",1
My order did not arrive but the app says its delivered? The delivery guy says you didn't pick up the call when I didn't get any? And i can't even complain anywhere that I didn't get the order? The best part there is no customer care number that works! Wow!,1
Really Nice Food delivery app,5
"kindly provide an option of giving 0 rating as well, horrible app, very confusing to use and no way you will ever hear back from there customer support team. multiple order statuses visible for same order in different screens, either the app is hoax or they just believe in horrible consumer experience",1
1) Delivery service is so convenient. 2) The 50% offers and the other ones are just unbelievably economical. 3) Quite some choices available. And this will be your downfall. You give so much and you won't get anything in the end. Bad for startups.,5
The order never refreshes and I have never seen the live tracking working. Restaurant orders get cancelled saying item is not available. Then why did it show up in the menu. Thanks a lot for your services so far.,1
I was given food order from cafe555 restaurant for 6th time but my food has been canceled due to wrong address and not received refund also... Immediately after 10 mints..i gave food order from my husband's mobile and I received that food parcel on same address with same restaurant and from last 4 days I am waiting for my refund but no response from zomato team...so guys be careful before order and pls don't make online payment...we can't believe zomato...,1
very bad experience. no concern for customer health. not ready to compensate full amount charged for the food that I had ordered. even after reporting that the restaurant has sent rotten food. zomato cannot keep such casual approach towards customer health. there has to be stricter rules against such cases where rotten food is served that can cause food poisoning.,1
Pathetic app. You place an order & wait for more than an hour. Suddenly you get to know that rider has not reached there. And the best part is customer service department is telling you sorry we do not have any rider available. The question is why are you taking orders then. Worst service ever. Deleting this app.,1
Good app. But sometimes you get different items from what you have ordered for. Packaging of the item is still not getting done properly. Need to pack the food properly.,3
worst app ever even customer care is worst no one can help you if you want to cancel your order or the valet is delaying i ordered some food from it but for some reason I had to cancel it but no response was there till half and hour and after half and hour they replied saying that you can cancel your order but no refund would be provided and next day i ordered something which was prepared in 15 minutes but the valet took 2 hours to reach my home and even spoked to me illiteratly worst experience.,1
"I used to love zomato, but the recent updates are not very user friendly. For example, earlier i could see number of reviews given along with the rating itself. Now if I go through delivery link, i can see it. Also the filter of (online order) is removed. Now i have to click the restaurant to see if the online orders are accepted.",3
"price of food seems higher than the restaurants original price. even higher than the price listed on other apps. so generally for the restaurants which are near to me, I prefer calling them directly and placing the order.",3
"It's extremely shameful to use such a popular app which fails to deliver hot food and doesnt let the customer have access to chat support system. As an avid user of zomato app, I have been not getting any customer chat support which is available on the app.In single day I was delivered cold food and one order which was not trackable. Zomato app really has lost its value and grace to serve it's customers. My recommendation is dont use the app at all, use other apps they help better and faster.",1
It's just a scam. They are not only giving you 50% discount on food item but also less than 50% off the food . Worst in matter of quantity of food. Just use some energy and go to the nearby restaurant and enjoy a full quality and quantity food.,1
Its not a good aap as it does only supports delivery boy and fake notifications and refund policy is pathetic if you select current address and order is placed then you might get a call from delivery boy the address selected from zomato app is not correct and please cancel your order and once you cancel your order your money and cake are take away from you. Cake will be taken by delivery boy and cash by zomato so please stop zomato and there are other beter aaps in market go for it. Rubbish...,1
"Customer handling zero, cancelation facility not available. No consideration, if you choose something by mistake and want to cancel. Such a behavior is unhealthy for any startup.",1
"Most of the restaurants are terrible, did not have any good experiences in 2 years! Terrible customer support, sometimes they do refund over their chat team but sometimes refunds are not enough for the time we waited and time we spent looking up options.. and it all just feels terrible terrible",1
mostly it's all look Good for me but your menu card style look bit of old school and taking time to figure out so if you change the style of your menu and add more pitcher of food which exactly from the targeted restaurant made food and make it easy to find them then it's all perfect.,5
"Good service, company providing satisfactory service",5
Very good service,5
Too many times you get the wrong order or incomplete order and Zomato never fixes the problem. All they do is offer Zomato credits which isn't much help. I didn't order food because I want credits. I ordered food because I wanted to eat food. Absolutely subpar service.,1
poorest of poor chat services.they will cancell you order( zomato) without your confirmation.this big shot even keep on saying sorry for same mistake.most importantly you need to remember all dates and amount everything as they are too busy to visit your old record...it doesn't matter if u get money or not...cunning ppl.. Every day you ppl have different excuses...last time u did not return my money which i paind for not serving my order....totally sick,1
"Pathetic experience. Clearly mentioned in the instruction ""No eggs please I am allergic to eggs"". Still got noodles with eggs that too after 2 hours. When contacted to zomato care they just sent a blunt system message saying sorry for the inconvience. Zomato became such a big brand and still doing these kind of absud things . Just disgusting. Will never opt for you , other services are way much better.",1
Really bad support service! The items I ordered were not available despite being listed on the menu and the restaurant accepting it! Now I'm being charged for the cancellation fee and the support stuff was of no help!,1
Cold food delivered and old,1
"Pathetic service. First of all the quality of the food the restaurants provide is too bad and when you complaint Zomato against them they say that you have multiple credit request. I ordered four times from Zomato, two times the Order quality was too good but the rest two times the food quality was damn pathetic and bad. It was stale and smelling bad. I complaint and then they say that I have too many credit request. recently I ordered and restaurant didn't accept the order, it's really pathetic",1
"I was looking for minus ratings however it was not an available option.. Zomato is looting people very conviniently by giving option of paying online and not refunding back in case ordered is rejected by resturant... Zomato delivery time is high, their delivery boys eating your food while delivering.. ratings given to resturants are unappropriate.. so for Zamato best tag line will be.. ALL IS HELL 😈",1
A lot of biased and sponsored reviews. Not really trustworthy when you are looking for honest feedback. However it is nice that you can check out menus here. Update: teams up with bloggers then they are paid (can be in kind) for good reviews.,2
"No service, Don't waste your money here. Its better to call the restaurant order directly from there. They are just taking money and giving you chilled food. What's point to get a food from out when you have to eat chilled. Take out anything from your frize that maybe much better than what they deliver",1
very bad customer experience. the map always picks wrong address. the driver and the zomato centre guys just keep harassing you. I have waited 2 hours for my delivery. yet the order not delivered. fix your app location first. Swiggy is far better.,1
"Worst app. If any issue arises with the order, the support system is automated and just not suitable to help. The numbers they provide of the restaurants are unreachable. The restaurants having poor quality food have 4 above rating. Just money diggers.",1
my first order was ok. but second order didn't come. they deducted the money and never even replied.on customer service. there is no way you can find there customer care contact info. vause there is none if there is then its either out of order or does no longer exist Zomato can be good in metro cities but not for small town. they don't give a s**t. Edit on 30/09/2019 Now they improved and i like when discount is provided by Zomato.,4
It is worst app ever. Ordered the food in near by restaurant and the order was placed in another branch which is a across the city. Also the order was never picked up by delivery person since it was raining. DONT EVER ORDER FOOD USING THIS APP ESPECIALLY WHEN ITS RAINING,1
My experience was very bad...had to wait for one and half hours for a pizza delivery...and when I followed up with the restaurant they said the Order is cancelled from Zomato and they did not the reason...now my money is gone...the order status says delivered...and me and family are starving...worst part is nobody is responding from the customer care...so much for customer service and accountability...,1
"Hi. Whenever i go to zomato chat, I can't see what I've written and cannot chat with the customer service. I think there's a bug in the latest update regarding this. Other than that the app is great.",3
There is problem going in the app..my money got deducted without any summary..I was just browsing..n the amount got deducted...I called immediately to cancel the order..they we can't refund amount ..if u want to take the order to the take or else leave...bt can't refund...so be aware ..I m still fighting for my refund..bt no reply yet,1
worst experience ever. order was placed a 1.2 hrs back and the agents are still unable to connect to the place. no update on the order status. Worst service ever. Still unable to give a confirmation that i will get my order or not.,1
The app keeps on crashing and when it worked and I was able to order a meal or didn't assign anyone for delivery post 15 minutes my order for cancelled and has the status as refunded. When I tried to connect with the customer care executives I didn't get any response.,1
This app is good for checking restaurant ratings and reviews. But pretty bad delivery. They started off okay but mostly there orders are delayed. Today they cancelled my order after one hour of ordering. Please use Swiggy if want good and fast delivery,2
Zomato is not foucsing on good quality of food i am regular user of zomato but most of the time quality of food is horrible,1
"This is the worst food delivery business and their app. Their vendors have listed menu that is not feasible for them to deliver. They have refused delivery many times, atleast they had enough shame this time to accept it. This they didn't have enough shame to accept their mistake.",1
"Don't expect any support from customer service end. Most of the time you will get a reply as Sorry for the inconvenience only, Also the shown price of items in app is more than the restaurant.",2
The money was deducted from my PAYTM account for a prepaid order and the order was not delivered. Although complete address of the delivery place was there. During live tracking the delivery boy was no where near my home. Mobile no of delivery boy was not given. They are refusing to deliver and refused to payback.,1
"They are always late, inaccurate time and no way to cancel the order.. Even when the app says 25 to 30 min rest assured they will deliver no sooner than an hour.. It is exhausting, by the time good arrives you could just cook and eat.",2
"As stated by Zomato support due to some recent changes they do not cancel order any more. Even if delivery time is near 2 hours. Estimated delivery time is not quoted before, post order if it's not per your conviennce than u r stuck. Stay away from these non customer centric company.",1
"Its fast. But one thing need improvement. Based on hygiene and class of hotel , facility to segregate order should be their. If i am in new city i dont know what type hotel it is how can it be ordered. I personally saw a dhaba having 'On Zomato' tag and when i saw inside it was pathetic. Worst hygiene. Please look in my suggestion",3
"Rates at the same hotel and zomato menu are different. At zomato rates are inflated alot by atlst 20%. Sometimes when u fill the cart and proceed to checkout, it shows "" something went wrong"" and the u need to order all over again .. i wish zomato can improve on that",2
Very bad customer service and they are least interested to listen to customers concern. They simply cancel the order and don't refund the amount. Many times informed about missing food but no action was taken..,1
"Fantastic app, fast delivery service , giving best offers just loved it.",5
There has to be a way to resolve despute between customer and restaurant. Sometimes restaurant forget to pack some items but cost is already paid through online. They should be able send remaining item later or should be able to refund. Right now customer bears the loss.,5
Best online place to have food😋,4
"Was better app once. After they disabled the COD option permanently most recently from their app, it has become a nightmare for customers who either are not willing to order food using net banking/debit card or does not have a bank a/c or ATM card. They are happy to pay by Cash! But unfortunately the COD option is not available at the moment :(",2
"Hey guys mark my words its a waste app to have, they doesn't allow to cancel on sake of wastage. They play games in comment section. I placed order but instantaneously my mood got changed and wanted to have other food to have but this zomato says that we don't have cancellation policy. Its a waste app to have to innocent people because the chat guy talks very rudely.. please uninstall the app and support me.",1
"Worst Service provider is Zomato. Zomato is never helpful when you receive any wrong item or a spoiled food delivered. Customer Service - Unreachable, If you,any how get connected via Chat, there time of reply will be after 15-20mins. Chances of getting a solution from them is 0% you will only get scripted apologizes in chat. If you want to order food online and even get a customer satisfaction switch to Swiggy. Yes they atleast respond to your queries with solutions. Take a session from swiggy.",1
"Very bad experience, sometimes delivery boy denied that he didn't receive any pickup order on online pay method and sometimes they had came so late 👎👎",1
"There is order support function on the app, which took 30 mins to get back to me, if you are offering an option to cancel order support on the app menu, you'd better be able to give that support to those customers who needs a cancellation.",2
The Refund policy sucks... You place an order>the order gets cancelled due to technical issues in the App > the customer care service initiatives a refund that will be credited after a week... What a joke... 🤦🏽‍♂ Go to Zomato and Order food... This App is a waste of money and time,5
Delivery is good,5
"I ordered from burger King and not received any food using this app. although they gave me credits of the same amount of my order and refunded my money for my order as well. This overall ordering and chatting with customer care took me an hour. Then i ordered my food again and had the same from the customer care over technical issue.this time i ordered it from yummy in tummy and to my surprise, the restaurant is not answer my calls and it has been almost 1.30 hour i have not received my food.",1
The latest update is troublesome. The app takes more time to liad and the UI itself looks very low class. I am not able to book any tables as well. The interface and the loading time is so bothersome that I am considering uninstalling the app.,1
wow this application very nice.,5
"Worst experience... When our order will show as on the way, it will show as Arriving in 15 Minutes, but it arrives after 1 hour. When called to the delivery guy he tells he has 2 orders to deliver... Then you Zomato guys should never say that ""Order will be delivered in Minutes"" We starve and order food, after more than 1 hour if we get our delivery what is the use of it??? I hope Swiggy will be better.....😤😡😠🤬",1
Whenever I order something everytime it just lags so much that I cannot keep up with the updates regarding the order and everytime it shows that you have an update and I updated it so many times and the app just shuts off and starts again and again and I'm troubled by this.,1
I ordered a dish and made online payment using Google pay. Automatically my order get cancelled and the delivery person refused to dilever my order. I complaint to customer care (through chat as Zomato doesn't provide contact no.) and I got the reply that I'll get my refund back in my acc. I still haven't received any refund since a week over. I re complaint but no use. I just get the same reply.,1
"useless service and a even more useless service. if something goes wrong with the order, there is absolutely nothing you can do n r helpless....most of the time their orders r late , go much beyond the time they mention. they really should shut down",1
"Getting poor services, nobody wants to help",1
Poor service . Delivery guy cancelled my order because my phone was not reachable . But I don't get the fact that they have the address and people deliver from the address they get not from the phone call . And after cancellation they not even return the money and totally denied the fact that it was their problem,1
"Worst app, I had very bad experience with the service. Not once or twice . It's repeated more than 5 times. They give fake assurance to people . Don't use this app especially when u r dying out of hunger!!!!",1
The used to be pretty good until they change the app design. Now nothing works especially the app's main function of searching for restaurants and the app just goes back whenever I try to read more about the restaurant. So now its basically useless and just takes up memory.,1
"awful customer service experience. Delivery boys are very good, fast, polite but customer service sucks. They're good for nothing, delayed in response, deliberately delayed so that they couldn't send survey link. I think Swiggy customer service is far better than Zomato.",2
"This app has made my life easier with tasty food in reasonable price, that to within a few minutes. Zomato offers good discount on foods. All the delivery boys are so humble & soft spoken, they are doing their job really well. I love ZOMATO.",5
Cheating app i ordered food i didnt got but my account has debited no one response from zomoto Very very worst,1
it takes more than 50to 60minutes to deliver whereas the resturants are about half km from my loaction but still they need more than an hour and second problem is the food quality is not upto the mark i think they change the actual food provided by resturant and exchanges somewhere in street foods and hence quality and quantity is lacking . compititers are far better than zomato,1
Service levels are pathetic. Especially during weekends. It's more than 2 hours that we are calling to follow up on the order .. and the kind of response what we have received is totally not acceptable .. It's high time zomato teaches their delivery section of the basic courtesy on how to talk to their customers..,1
"I booked my order 5-6 km far from my address. Delivery boy pick order and gone another 10km far opposite direction. And I called restaurant, they didn't picked call. Then I called delivery boy and it's ridiculous, that number is out of service and that number not belongs to delivery boy. 😀😀😀",1
"app is super...we were happy when launched in kakinada, after using from such long period, i observe that more than 5km Restaurant are not showing in my aap. I suggest zomato management to levy some delivery charge and provide the service. we missed often good restaurants which are on the other side of the city.",5
Zomato charges more than the actual restaurant price .very bad service ... and customer care chat support is also not supportive . they jusy defend Zomato service without any logic. .. Foodpanda is lot better ... the only reason i booked from Zomato was because the restaurant was not available on Foodpanda or Swiggy ... thrid class service,1
"Don't download worst app. After one time order there is problem regarding order i.e you will not able to place order easily, for ordering you hvae to msg. zomato chat supporter, I think only zomato supporter and valet are perfect i.e tgey give quick response but app have inappropriate problems. Very bad experience very very bad",1
"Worst management The delivery was estimated in 31 min, I awaited 1½ hour still won't get delivered. Finally I had to cancel my order. An the customers care says 'Wait it will come, have patience. We are trying to reach the restaurant' and also givin excuses they are not recieved the call. They literally don't know how to manage the business. Worst experience ever. Totally disappointing",1
UI needs to be improved. Example if I want to order any dessert I need to scroll all the way down. Instead have sorted sections side ways. I don't see any good offers on Zomato Gold too. Since Uber Eats is acquired now I'm missing a lot of eats exclusive menu and discounts which they had. Why not have those here too?,3
Not so good at least befor listing restorent you should test the recepy. Dan you should list them. few restorent specially in faridabad the will charge like delhi but test is just pathetic....for expale every chicken item has almost same test nothing deffrent. Serioully zomato guys you should think about this suggestion belive me your bussiness will boost otherwise you now your Groth rate y to y...,1
They have lathetic automatic chat option. When I ordered it was saying 40 minutes. And it is been more than 55 minutes I am waiting for the order still it is showing it will take another 17 minutes.,1
Very good service,5
"It is really cool a way of providing the best available Food at the best available time to your door step, truly excellent service delivery, saying it with 2 years of experience had with Zomato. It is overwhelming to see, the exceptional support and happiness which zomato is providing. Thank you so much and #happy fooding :)",5
"easy to use, good follow ups in case of issues. some issues: - most ratings/reviews are fake/paid, Zomato needs to do something about this menace. - restaurant should mandatorily provide printed bill copy along with order. - restaurant address is not visible on listings",4
"Good app and all but, an issue occurs that just our neighbors receive meals from a specific restaurant but when we try to order, it shows that the restaurant is currently not accepting orders. Please resolve this issue.",3
"Best App for Ordering Food and Dinning with option for booking your table. The best service after u place your order with frequent updates. The best part is even after you place your order, Zomato calls the Hotel management to accept the order and start preparing, 2nd the delivery agent goes to the restaurant to place the oder for you, never seen this kind of service in other Apps, rest assured your food delivered on time. Also offers great discounts on food. kudos great service ZOMATO.",5
"its the worst experience with the app. customer service is extremely worse. Waiting time is 5-10mins to get reply for each question. Zomato competitors do much better than this. Worst app and worst service. i will check once more, if it repeats i am gonna say bye bye to Zomato for ever.",1
Delivery is not very fast but it's ok,1
Very good service 👍,5
"On registration, I was given 50% off on first 5 orders. My first order was via Cash, so they said discount not applicable on cash. When I tried my next order online and tried to apply 50% off it says you have used up all the coupons!!!",2
very bad experience. Total amount charged as cancellation fee with out any proper response from customer care. I wanted to change the item in my order request for cancellation of items immediately after placing order. but my full amount deducted...,1
"Stay away from the this crappy app. They charged me 3 three times for my order. I prooved it but they still don't want to pay this money back. After all my emails, each time company sends me generic lie says it will be paid back within 7 days. It's been 3 weeks already. Still waiting for 310AED refund.",1
"Very nice app to order food and it offers a great quality of service, but i must suggest them to go through their location selection criteria once again because some of the restaurant which is near me is not delivering at my home but delivering at my friends home which is far from the restaurant.",5
I had ordered the food. Amount got deducted but no one delivered the food saying I was not available at the place and even my phone was unreachable. Fraud ...scam And yes even after posting the message on their email these people are saying that our food is getting wasted. Above all they are telling customer not ti behave the same... True bluff master.....,1
The very big problem of this app is that without confirmation of the restaurant the app is giving the commitment to the customer for the same . Usually for 3 to 4 hours. I will suggest never order from this app . To here are lot more apps to explore,1
"Extremely well interface app...am sure you have improved with users feedback. Suggest you make a cart for later booking / ordering...food. Like you have in Amazon and snapdeal ect. In a cart park concept you don't have to remember the items for selection again.... However I don't understand Gold to Zomato Pro is it down grading the membership status....I asked Zomato, they say it's the same benefits we will get and we will get 40 to 50% discount...on overall bill. Need to see the final benefits.",5
"Stupid app. Not even letting me log into my account. It is just saying ""error occurred "" after multiple tries using my email id. When I try login with phone number, it just says the account already exists in my phone.I have more than a 40 days left in zomato gold.",1
"The delivery part is good , but sometimes after the payment is done it shows that transaction hasn't been processed, we order from some place else and we get bothered orders later wasting our moneys. Please remove the bugs in payment options",2
Pathetic service. They have dominos as a client. My order was delivered after 1 hour with 3 missing items. Zomato refused to help me with it. Kept asking me to call dominos who wouldn't pick up the phone Ridiculous service. Swiggy is way more helpful. They atleast refund your money.,1
"recently I have worst experience, i ordered food on same add. still the rider reached somewhere else and act like i mention wrong add. afterwords he called to costumer care and they also in his faver and that rider himself not clear where he actually is so take care of this, otherwise app is good enough 👍",3
Very good service,5
Delivery is too late n in the chat option I m unable to share my problem. I m using this app for my convenience not for late delivery,1
"Great delivery and wide range of restaurant options to choose from. Best part i love about this is no matter what time you order, be it in the morning or late nights past 2 or 3 am you still get your food delivered to you quickly from the options available.",5
I had worst experience with this app. The zomato valet itself travels in different direction. N even the resto is just 1km away its been one hour n yet i didnt get my order but last time wen i canceled the the order zomato charged even its just a min after i ordered now you guys have to pay compensation as i didnt receive my order at all then,1
"The UI is perfect and scrollable. Aid of a picture makes it easier to prepare the tastebuds already before the food is even delivered. The Restaurant's ratings are accurate and justified. Also, Zomato has given a good exposure to the small joints around which is again a good thing.",5
"Very Good App easy to place orders a bit inflated prices but its ok as they give option to apply coupon which make ur order at par with market prices (sometimes cheaper) However the Restuarants Hotels doesn't maintain the quality of food, they usually take customer on Zomato for granted.",3
"It's a worst app doesn't get connected properly with customer and restaurants, order acceptance takes time, if you cancel it they charge you next time for the same no matter if it is restaurants mistake or app has problem. Not recommend.",1
"Very bad experience with the auto location selected while placing the order, and the customer service executive was not even ready to refund the charge. i has taken my office address which is 6km away from home. Why would I be at office at night 11. Pathetic customer service.",1
"Pathetic customer sevrice . The wait time to respond will be around 10 minutes and when u executive will get assigned then he/she will make you to wait quite long. I have to wait for 30 min at least to tell my concerns and after this long wait they will say ""we will take your feedback."" The food quaiity will degrade automatically if you order food from zomato as compared to other apps.",1
when i ordered food its spoiled and they said it will be refunded but its never. second time i placed order delivery boy said that he is not going to deliver the food. top of that he says do what ever you want. one of the worst app i ever experience. even single star is more this service.,1
Not recommendable at all as they have worst customer support.... there is only a way to connect with them via chat and they dont reply instant on that.... they cancelled your order after 45 min and mag you sorry for the inconvenience as we dont have a boy to deliver your food... really bad want to give zero rating... big zero from my side,1
this app sucks I mean it just debited my account twice but my order wasn't placed when concerned with the support they seems to be not responsible for this rather the restaurant is... all I want to say is waste of ordering on this app... just hate it... in the beginning I used to love this app but not anymore...,1
I love this app.Its very helpful and provides all details about restaurants... Its a great one for foodies...,5
I love this app because always I always order food from ZOMATO and the restaurant is 8 km far from our house and then also it comes in 20 minutes and one thing zomato has always offer and I live in Jalgaon and there was only one delivery app in Jalgaon that was foodies and the restaurant was just 2 km far from our house then also it takes 1 hour and the food was very cold from that time I never order food online then after 2-3 months then Zomato came in Jalgaon Thank u very much Zomato 🙏🙏🏻,5
"Been using these food delivery app for months,there is no improvement at all! fake menu which are not there on the restaurant,fake menu pictures,delivery person never reach the location-always have problems with delivery location! Swiggy/Uber is far more better,Go for that!",1
"Of all the things, what makes Zomato special is it's instant chat support. Been using this app for a while now and it hasn't disappointed in terms of immediate support in case of inconvenience. (Except for this one time but will excuse that lol)",5
"App is easy to use. Zomato itself is a good service for foodies. It is very convenient to order food or read reviews of restaurants. However sometimes the rates in the app are higher than the restaurant menu card, and to it the delivery charges even for Zomato Gold members. So watch the costs while ordering.",4
Sending two deliveries at once is a really bad idea. The delivery guy will have to wait at the restaurant really long as he has to collect two orders at once plus the delivery will also take really long.. I'm having to wait double the time for every order I place on Zomato.,1
Very bad experience with zomato taking payments and then cancelling order due to some reason. You could mention the reason before we make payments. And for refunds it takes a long time. Not satisfied with the service. Zomato keeps pushing us to stay with COD as that way we wont loose our money and then have to wait for it for a week. We would be waiting to have the things ordered and after a long time a message of cancellation gives us too much despair.. Zomato should handle this issue.,1
"Extremely poor service, and all the customer service can answer is that they regret causing inconvenience. By far the worst food aggregator service. They should better stick to just showing restaurants rather than accepting orders which they can't fullfill",1
"Zomato has lost its standards..every time I write instructions to the restaurant regarding the last meal I ordered and face a new issue regarding the present order.I doubt these guys share feedback to the restaurant otherwise service would have been improved by now.Also their riders are untrained and mostly lose their way while delivering and as a result, deliver unfresh food.",1
"Very Bad, there is always delays in delivering the order. And just one word is used SORRY with no improvement. Even when the food is ordered in middle of the week with less traffic and no rain still there is delays in delivering the food. Infact now I should be SORRY to use this App",1
Very good service,4
I ordered 2 time from zomato but twice no one come and its showing u can receive your order after 1 hour 1h30 which is really bizarre since the restaurant is very near !! when im ordering from other platforms the delivery will call they will show u all details with reasonable timing and value the customer here 2 times no one give me a call or even show up so i had to delete this app,1
"No good service plus it is very expensive to order food for middle class person as it takes 50 rs like delivery charges even if you order for 500 and above. And also include taxes of 20-40 rs. No offers nothing, and even the delivery chrge is not fully paid to delivery persons they get like 20 rs. Disgusting",1
"After collaboration with Uber, the service of this app becomes more pathetic. They didnt deliver food at the mentioned address plus charges unneccessary bucks for the delivery. Further, they dont have customer care number instead they provide only chat support, which generally waste valuable time.",1
Good and easy service with satisfaction chargeable money,5
The zomato chat service is really bad. they take 5-10 mins to even reply the query. Even worst is I am not able to cancel the order when the restaurant is not accepting. Also the delivery time is really long most of the times.,2
worst complaining service ever ......at first my order was incomplete ..then the next time i found a cocroach in my food ...and they are just giving me some absurd chatting and sorry messeges ...i cant trust this app at all ...they have cheap restaurants which will give you food poisioning for sure ...basically youre eating insects,1
Horrible customer service. They took the address wrong first of all and the customer service were very unhelpful while we tried to sort the address issue. Not a single number customer care number was answered and the chat was equally unhelpful. The delivery guy was incredibly rude and unhelpful with the same. Really dissapointed.,1
My go to app for ordering food. Very convenient. Let down just once when Zomato delivery persons were not available and I was notified only several hours later! Thankfully the restaurant delivered with it's own staff on that occasion.,4
The delivery time is double compared to other food delivery apps. Starts at 33 mins and takes more than an hour😒😒,1
Out here in Noida the service and the price and the offer's and even the quality and quantity of the food is really good !! I have had a few issues which were resolved immediately so the customer service was also quite good !!,5
"it's an amazing app.. I really like the services.. it's better then any other online food servicing apps.. when ever i ordered food it's before the ETA time, the executives are polite and food is carried in a very good way.. Thank you Zomato i wish you guys continue serving always 👍😗",4
"Worst service. After placing order you will be told that the restaurant has his own delivery system and we cannot track the order. If you try to cancel the order aftet adequately waiting as per the expected delivery period, they did not refund. So be aware.. If possible dont use Zomato.",1
Great App. Frequent user. Only downside is Zomato never refunds for cancelled orders. Have lost my money multiple times for cancelled orders. Nevertheless App wise excellent service and interface. Hope they shall refund my canceled orders money sometime too and then it shall be 5/5.,3
Price is not accurate,3
This is the best food delivery app,5
"Had very doubtful experience yesterday. Ordered food reached me within 3 mins. Many dilusions in mind whether Zomato is advising there employees to get food anywhere else in between, like another dhanda or asking them to order inadvnce as we have common brkfsts idli,dosa. No bills are submitted by the delivery guys. Hw can we believe. To them evrythng is business. The quality of the food is also bad i felt like chewing mud in between. plz do nt accept food without bill.Beware Disgraceful people.",1
Very good and also bad means equal,5
"It would be more convenient if we can share our problem with our own words .zomato gave a limited option for customers in chat , the rest, love the app awesome! Zomato can actually fulfill foodies wish at door step. Excellent job, team zomato and the people who make this app at such lvl.Thank you .",4
"In every every order i placed before, They always showed that it you buy Zomato gold you will save this and that and you will get one dish free. Then I bought Zomato gold. Alas.!! Since then no benefits whatsoever. No free dish. The restaurant which offer gold they are so far away and costly with delivery time of more then 45 min. I am really disappointed. :(",3
best app for food,5
"Delivery fee is too high. Absolutely ruined my ordering experience when the delivery fee of the order itself comes up to a thirds of the total order. Even though the food is good, i don't feel like ordering because of the heavy fees",1
In last 10 days we have ordered for more than 5-6 time. Of which zomato has to refund money for 3 transactions because delivery didnt happen.ans for 1 order they have to refund coz the food was awful. Now they dont call for any support they ll just tell u to mail. After mailing couple of times there response is just horrible. 629+ 326+ 581+ one more amount m able to recollect. They have to return. But there are not returning my money. This is the worst experience. Shame.,1
Very good service,5
Worst app I can't order food in this app I have sent many times feedback but it's not responding,1
"After updation this app is very poor. The previous old version was good. The updated version does not give any details where the delivery executive is, how much time the executive take, when he deliver the order. Did not saw any details. Very bad version.",1
"I don't know if they charged for me only, but the bill where I ordered from was different than the amount I paid to buy the food in this app, the difference came upto 50 rs when int he bill it was already mention 30 for delivery, if this is normal then it's ok, but charging 50 more seperate just for delivery which is nearby is just not right. I had also asked for why so much difference in both bill but not yet got a reply, rest all there was no problem",2
There is a serious concern about this app that they dont show that the outlet will capable of deliver the food or not.... They just take booking and give it to the oulet. Later the outlet told us to cancel it..... This is the major drawback of this app.,1
"Zomato is one of my favourite app's, trustworthy and best options available! When it comes to ordering we always make mistake so would like zomato to add a feature where in if i order a particular type of food ie without onion and garlic or something to which I'm allergic with.. is set by default while placing orders online.. It happens a lot of time that food customization is available but we tend to forget, it will be really helpful if done and its more user friendly 😎",4
So disappointing. I order pizza hut at 8:59pm which delivered to me at 10:30pm This is not the first time. Few weeks ago my cousin also ordered PH from same location and it was delayed for one hour. Ultimately he had to cancel the order. It seems that zomato has no control on the vendors,1
Good app and can be improved further,4
"Ordering on Zomato cost double in comparison to dine in. Zomato first charges some 20-25% from restaurant partners that only the end user i.e we the customers only have to pay as the prices shown on zomato are much higher/ double than the original price. And on top of that, zomato charges for multiple things like unnecessary surge charges, taxes, delivery charges etc etc. Zomato should focus on quality and economical service rather than MONEY MAKING and FOOLING people on the name of discounts.",1
Wasted my time waiting for order. Don't list if you don't have wallet. First of all the prices are 10 bucks more than restaurant plus the delivery charges are sky high and the whole city is within 4 kms.,1
I ordered a meal from a restaurant listed on Zomato and put the on time delivery on it too and towards the end of the time within which it has to be delivered they are calling and telling your address is far so we are cancelling your order and when i asked for the refund of my money they are saying that they are barred from giving refunds and hence the robbed me in broad day light of my hard earned money so guys please don't use this app.,1
"Zomato might have the worst customer service and policies ever. At the time of writing this, it has been more than a week when a Zomato executive delivered a wrong, lower value item to me for a prepaid order. I immediately contacted the support but the guy straight refused to help and said that I will recieve an email from their team. I questioned him as to what am I supposed to do about my ruined dinner and he didn't have any answers. Now after multiple chats with their support, no email and no real solution to my problem. I realise that it is time to uninstall an app that cheats and steals and does not have the decency to provide answers.",1
"A horrible experience.. Uninstalling the app. Guys, don't encourage these kind of apps to take over your life. The basic integrity of customer service is lacking. Even in their policies. They say once the food is ordered the next second itself the restaurant starts preparing and loots the whole amount of the food after canceling the next second. How ridiculous! Please learn from swiggy-customer values.. These kind of rules is just going to ruin you. Hate the app🤮",1
"This application is a cheat; 1: They cancelled my orders twice on the same day from different places and didn't refund us even though they said they will 2: It doesn't accept my address and insists on changing the address which then confuses the delivery people 3: I try putting my adress and it changed it after which I had to cancel my order because it would never reach and guess what, THEY ARE CHARGING ME FOR CANCELLATION OF ORDER EVEN THOUGH I CANCELLED IMMEDIATELY,Just dont download this app",1
I use this from a year good service but I face some some problem like I place order by mistake & I cancel it within minute but Payment is deducted & not refunded so m so disapponted When I do COD & cancel you call me & ask me for payment like you have to pay even though u canceled . So when I paid then u also have to give my money back. I totally disapointed.,1
New interface is nice but the stability of app is reduced dractically eg. I tried to add promo code and after clicking apply it take more than 5 minutes to show the total price and not shown the total amount at last and my mobile is running with Android 9 pie hence no chance of issue in my phone.,3
I ordered my food at 9.15p.m & didn't receive the food at all... kept calling tge valet but he didn't answer my phone. the reason for cancellation is showing tgat i didn't answer the phone. the usual wait time shows 2-3minutes in query section but its been more than 40 minutes i have been waiting for the reply.,1
Really poor customer service and no cooperation at all. I have personally tied all other food delivery apps but this is just too much . Irresponsible behaviour of staff . Most of the times order items are missing . Please don't download,1
"Order never arrived.The delivery boy said he accepted the order but did not go to pick it up. And Zomato apparently did not reallocate the order!!! I have been waiting for more than 2 hours!! This is my 2nd experience with Zomato!!! Very disappointing. And what's funny is, it's still showing to be delivered in 25mins. Lol",1
"worst service. Dont use zomato instead you can use any other service. I made my first order yesterday, I've received only one item whereas i ordered 2. The courier person said, you'll get partial refund. Now when I contact zomato, i getting weird answers. They don't know who are their courier persons and restaurant. Finally answer from zomato, we're not responsible but I paid to zomato. I'd like to share the screenshot of the transcript but I not getting attachments option",1
"Being a foodie Zomato acts like a guide for the best places to visit for what you are exactly looking for, cuisine or cost wise too. There are genuine public reviews,menu cards which make it useful to decide what to choose from. Looking at zomato service & experience I also took zomato gold. I use the Zomato delivery too & no such complaints so far. Most important thing is it's trusted & verified list when they show preferences for hygienic places. Enjoying tr lot of offers always!",4
"happy with dineout option, but very disappointed with delivery. this app doesn't show restaurant location . and the delivery will say why do you ordered so long. why the hell we should answer them and who are they to ask us. poor ui for delivery.nd one more issue is that cancellation of order is not user choice",2
The most convenient app for all your food temptations. Lots of amazing options to choose from. The user interface of the app is also good. Helps in easy navigation and search. Must-have app on every phone.,5
"Fraud app, DONT ever pay by card... they dont deliver the food and then refuse returning your money. A complete waste of time. For 3 hours they kept me engaged in chat saying 10 min, 15 min to delivery When I finally called the restuarant. they said they havent recieved any such orderor call from zomato regarding this. The cstmr support just said there is no way to refund, they will not cancel the order. I didnt recieve my order atlast zomato.chat is not responding. Still not recieved my money",1
It's a very good app for ordering food online. I'll surely recommend this app to some other people also. You also should download this app as this contain a lot of variety of food. I enjoyed it very much.,5
"very worst services.. I m ordering regularly from zomato and making an online payment everytime, 3 or more times I didn't get the delivery and zomato service is saying that food has delivered. yesterday I have ordered food at 11.30 p.m and after 15 min the app is showing that ur food is delivered, I have called the delivery boy and he is saying that I m going to the restaurant, I have said OK I have recorded his call and after 2 hour I didn't get the deliver I have also mailed the recording to z",1
Very much Satisfied with the service ..Your regular offers and coupons are exceptionally well. I am cutting down one star because of some past discrepency issues for which i never got my refund of. But overall Zomato is best food delievery app ....Keep the good Work .... I am with Red 😋,4
Worst app... They will not refund your money in case their tie up restaurant says that they have cancelled the order as your number was not reachable. Without tip being included in the order your order will never be delivered and your money will not be refunded..,1
worst food delivering application...order the food but didnt get it...agent was not responding to the calls...after one amlnd half hour switch offed the mobile. and chat support didnt supported in the complaint and also was not replying to the chat messeges...i will going to file a case against zomato and the rider.,1
"worst app, worst service.. we order cake get a smashed up one and then no service we have to adjust.. go on chat they say send an email.. end of the day they get richer by robbong the public... I wish action is taken and these guys are pulled offline.. they have no customer service number.. so how do they get entertained",1
"Hotel the max is very bad resturant, the hotal agent don't know that how to treat with customers.",1
If Zomato don't have tie-up with Domino's Pizza why they are showing it in their app. Earlier it was just showing Domino's in the app but I can't able to place order. Now when it allow me to place order Zomato inform me that for Domino's order they will not deliver it's Domino's guys who will deliver. On the other hand Domino's guys are not able to deliver we have to pic up from outlay. I think Zomato is for delivery of food. If they are not responsible in case of dominos than why they are taking orders on behalf of them. After whole payment who is responsible Zomato or Domino's? Very unethical practices. Didn't like it.,2
Everything is fine ... Just stop giving multiple orders at the same time to the delivery man especially when its late night at 10 pm they are facing a huge problem because of this . They cannot deliver food at the right time for this Thank you !,5
Pathetic Service During last 12 hours 2 times my order got cancelled. Tried to reach customer care but they dont have any number. Trying to use chat option there none of the executive is available. I placed an order with Burger King 30 min ago now they are calling and we wont be able to fulfill your order and now they are forcing me to accept the product of their choice. If I didnt recieve call back within an hour I am going to sue you in court.,1
"Multiple times the order got cancelled after payment is done and restaurant has accepted the order. It's silent cancellation with a message. If you don't notice the message, then you are gone. I never faced it in Swiggy.",2
No response from customer care services and even no proper food delivery,2
"uninstalling after watching a video on Facebook, courtesy Public TV; actually where food is prepared for your delivery to customer. they might be in small numbers but still precautions is better than cure, that how it goes. Also had worst experience from one of the restaurant where i ordered food, rice which packed not cooked properly from Thirumala Royal Briyani, Indiranagar",1
Food was spoiled and spilled. I talk to the customer care and shown them the photos too. But they did nothing and my money was wasted. Neither they refunded nor they ordered another food. I cant eat spoiled food like that. Actually i have ordered pizza and pizza should be kept horizontally to avoid spoilage but the delivery boy kept the pizza in a vertical position because his bag was vertical.So its obvious that pizza will be spoiled.But i got no money refunded. It had happened 3 times with me.,1
Very bad experience. Not responsible for refunds and online payments failure.,1
"i have a horrible experience with zomato as either the restaurant listed on their panel do horrible things or sometimes issue is with delivery boy handling the item. also the app doesn't allow to choose self pickup option. also zomato never refunds full amount on their mistake, they return only 20%",2
Very worst app and service..i recommend not to use zomato as refund service is very disgusting..during placing of order they take money straight away but if ur order is cancelled refund option is very bad and they give just excuss that payment will be transffered in 5 to 7 days or 24hrs which seems like confusing and prehistoric..NEFT process if done alsi which is slow the money will be transferred in 3 to 4hrs or if sent by postoffice also 3days max..looks like zomato doing fraud.,1
"Till Yesterday, The app was working perfectly fine but Now Zomato introduce Zomato gold overlay ads and it made the app slower as well as unresponsive on several times. Please check this issue asap as I am unable to order since morning due to thia issue. Hope technical team will resolve this issue asap. Thanks",1
"None of the delivery person is able to find my location inspite the correct address and pin location, I never faced this problem with uber delivery, but for this location issue i hate Zomato app and service. Please call me and try to fix this issue, till then im not going to use Zomato services",1
"I have installed this app an hour ago, i placed an order just now, my account was debited, my bank sent the message showing the money was paid to zomato, but zomato app is showing that there is no order placed. I want a refund. Absolutely horrible experience for the first time.",1
Very worst service from zomato. we have provided some address n zomato GPS shown some other address. when delivery executive called i informed him that to deliver to my address its not to far from his location to my lication its about 700 metre so finally executive said to cancel the order n i did. but Zomato did not refund my amount and they have took cancellation fees without confirmation bloody begger they are making money n bluffing with customers. i suggest to people better go far swiggy,1
They don't take customers seriously if some one is ordering using your app show them you are worth taking the responsibility not just taking it and doing nothing over the same. Chat service only tell you stay connected we will handle this and for 10 mins. They will answer you back.,1
Worst app I have used Food is not not delivered on time driver lies on call after confirmation that he is on location and coming to deliver food. They dont know how to deliver food. Very bad frustrating poor App and also I didn't received my refund even though I haven't canceled my order.,1
worst responsive app ever for food delivery...they cant even confirm order even after 40 mins..atleast they should suggest the customers to cancel it after a very long time...and i surely think 45 mins is a very long time just to confirm an order...for god's sake i am done with this app,1
"extremely poor support team ! average time to respond to a chat is 4-6mins and after spending an hour chatting with the support about complains regarding food , they expect a full picture of meal. So , After an hour's chat , Zomato cant help you if you do not have full picture of your meal. Conclusion - Your issues are never resolved!!",1
"they don't have cancellation option and customer service is very bad, if we select wallet option then coupon code will remove automatically, and i paid full amount most of the time. today i called customer service and told them to cancel my order coz i wanted to apply promocode but he denies and he didn't apply promocode also, promocode he can apply!!!...worst app",1
"The service has become poor, if you order milkshakes they club 5-6 orders on one delivery boy, as a result by the time your thick milk shake arrives, all the ice cream is melted... this has happened multiple times, would recommend makers of milk shake to make note of this as because of tomato people might be losing interest in your product",1
"Ordered cake today from Zomato they have uploaded all wrong description and photos on one of their pastry shop located in Vikaspuri (pastry palace) and when they send the wrong order not even ready to accept its was there fault, tried to complain through email and chat bit is was not usefull, also the delivery agent is not following any of the guidelines made for coronavirus instead they should have open the cod if thats how they want to continue all wrong doing .",1
most of the numbers to contact the restaurants simply dont work.. any need to contact the restaurant have to wait for the valet to reach rhe restaurant.. changed from 2 stars to one cause the customer service is soooooooo bad they take forever to reply and get anything sorted. seem to have a snails pace work policy..,1
Thanks for making this type of app which is very crucial and essential food app in very affordable price. I can easily order food with minimum time . Its delivery boys also are humble and gentle. My experience with this app has too gud.,5
"After i updated to the new version in my phone, i had ordered only once. That's how bad the update is. Every time i open, i get error. Kindly make the changes to be user friendly.",1
"With Zomata, we have faster deliveries (than Swiggy) , but there are no good offers and the cost is high. For example, the same food items from the same restaurant would be costlier in Zomato than in Swiggy. Could improve on that.",4
"Differs from time to time, unreasonable service care. Pointless to order from anwhere except from proper restaurants that you would visit. Spend good money and you will be served well. I do that. Otherwise its really not worth it. Just go eat on the street or cook maggie... Or die.",2
Its no more an amazing experience... a few super bad experience also... Todays worst experience... no order has been recieved even after 2hrs and yet they dont pay back or cancel the order,1
Very very fast Service,5
"No complaints, BUT please just provide the home delivery men with some cash or ask them to carry it themselves and pay them later. It would greatly improve the customers' experience by sparing them the anxiety of having to search for (a petty amount of money) a needle in the haystack.",5
Try to reduce the delay in delivey,3
Very good service,5
Very bad service. Orders fails to deliver or cancels most of the time. Even they dont have proper management. Really fedup with all this..Im a regular and daily user of this app. But this app sucks mostly. This is the best review about this app. I cant give Zero rating othrwise i must have given it.,1
Awesome app for a foodie like me,5
Too much content and UI is messy. Ordering food is not an easy task. Got confused and ordered wrong dish when I ordered the first time. And forced suggestions are very annoying. Miss the clean interface and awesome offers of Uber eats.,2
Sorry but this app is not good because when I open this app it showing enter your location when I enter my location then they showing (we are not delivering here at the moment! Please try a different location or try again later )and when I searching for deliver food for pizza then it showing (no found for pizza )so what can I do so please tell me this app used or not for delivering food 😡,1
"The app is advertising that the first 3 orders are up to %60 off with a promo code but when I try to use it for the second time it is not allowing me. After I contacted the support, they said they took note of the bug and that's it. Low customer service.",1
"After charging you around $2 (5 to 8 AED) for delivery, they assign their drivers 2 orders at a time so instead of getting your order in 30 to 45 minutes as it's advertised you get it after 1 and a half hours or 2 hours, of course after the food become colder and soggy... forget about the food quality. Since their talabat deal, they are impressing their customers with the expectations that they USED to offer. Maybe giving UberEats a shot, and I even heard that Careem does this too. Thank you",1
"The navigation system of the app is aweful. Team needs to check on the navigation system of the vallor. Inspite of detailed addresses, still the valors do face issues to reach the destinations. Your compititors don't need such navigation from the customers to reach the destination.",3
"Everything is fine just one issue even if u immediately cancel your order they would charge you the full amount and the reason is great.... ""preparation has begun"" so they wanna say within few seconds they start preparing the order if this is so then y the hell do they ask for so much time for delivery",1
"Well, its an classic case of passing the ball. Zomato you need to fix glitches at your end instead of coming back to customers and then cancelling the order. You arr not the only island in the sea, there are many more.",1
Very good service,5
The best food delivery app in my opinion. The refund policy and team is up to the mark. No words for how zomato delivers the food ordered . In love with zomato. The experience is smooth and effortless.,5
"ordered received after 70 min. where as it mentioned 25-30 min while booking. delivery boy doesnt know the address which is in prime location of city and i navigated him. parcel is not packed or sealed, any one can open it and close it in between. veey bad zomato. thz my first order and will be last too.",1
Very good service,5
"Zomato is a recommended app because of certain reasons. One is it always offer some additional offers on almost daily basis. Another one is problems are being resolved here with full dedication. The hospitality provided by the staff members is amazing, which is a whole package for making this app more lovable. I'm thankful to them for listening to my problem patiently and resolving the tribulation earlier.",5
"very bad and pathetic services offered, dont consider the timelines of order shown, they dont stick to it. I was promised order in 35-40 mim and took 1 hr 30 min to deliver. There would be no proper and timely support given by zomato, The restraunt guy took the order back, leaving us both and our kid hungry at 11:30 pm. kid slept on hungry stomach and later we were forced to the same. the delivery services offered are third class even after paying charges for delivery.",1
Very good service,5
No one cares if the order was delivered incomplete. Delivery boy shrugged off saying call the restaurant or chat in online support. Zomato support decided to refund but then deducted some money without giving any reason. Refund again is a scam as they add it as zomato credit. There simply is no support and accountability if anything goes wrong.,1
Best app for foodies Just loved it Best customer service support No problem with anything Order and.njoy😍😍,5
"The customer service is worst. The person in the chat took half an hour to respond after the initial Hello and his first question. Because of this my order was delivered even before I could cancel it, even though I requested for the cancellation within seconds after placing the order.",1
this is the worst servicr provider ever also they keep rates higher than they actually are on stores and also the customer care aint helpful even a bit and becomes rude as hell once you pay they cannot return your money and neither can they cancel your order!! and if you try to cancel they will charge the full amount of your order and will cancel it for you !! i mean yeah wow slow claps for the brilliant kind of service they provide. employees doesnt know how to handle the food total trash servic,1
"Pathetic, Miss you uber eats! I used Zomato first time in 2018, the order took more than 3 hrs to get delivered. And food got delivered after 1AM at night. Now after switching from uber eats, my first order got cancelled after more than 1 hour of ordering. Very irresponsive restaurants, delivery system as well as customer support. UNINSTALING IT RIGHT NOW!",1
"Fantastic Service..... I had Ordered 2 Thumps Up and 1 Sprite .. All 750ml from a Store name Roshan Bakery. But when the delivery Boy Came he had jus 2 of them.. he asked me to send a msg on Support Chat. Within 5 secs of my reporting the iaaue he got a Call and once he had confirmed that the store had sent on 2 bottles, i was immediately given Zomato credits which reflected the next time i ordered. I like Zomato.. its the best app for ordering Food.... 👍👍👍",5
The app is too cluttered...please simplify the menus....the last few updates have added so many bugs....orders not going through...orders getting cancelled randomly with no explanation....your zomato executives have no explanation either...very bad service...will look for a local competitor!,1
"service are not good, am very disappointed that the delivery could not read map, packing is very poor we are spending money to have some good food with family but the quality of food they provide is very poor, am extremely disappointed, i recommended zero star, actually zero is more to zomato",1
"Worst app!!!! Cant support customers on time. They say we cant do anything wait thats it. You have to wait for hours for one order to be delivered. Dont use this app. If there was zero stars, would have given zero for the service.",1
Nice app and i love this app but when we order pizza or chicken leg pieces it dont show how many pieces we get but nice,5
Very good service,4
Zomato is losing it's worth. Any order reaches at least after 1 hour regardless of what place you choose. Discount Codes are mentioned for discount but it directly post the order without asking for code. No customer service to help. Only a Bot chat who gives you options of Zomatos interest. Feel bad.,1
It's better to call the restaurant and pick up the food yourself than order from Zomato. The discrepancy between the estimate time and actual time is more than half hour sometimes which makes a world of difference when it comes to food.,1
"Worst food delivery app, I wasn't given discount despite applying coupon and the customer care isnt friendly either, all responses were sorry, we can't help you, neither they are willing to cancel the order nor refund the discount, very bad customer service .. such a shame..",1
i had a horrible experience with zomato. i placed an order (dominos). i didnt receive the order. couldn't reach the restaurant. the numbet on the portal is incorrect. zomata guys doesnt have call center facility. the chat support is useless. the attitude with which the guy msged is very disturbing. BTW it was a prepaid order. i didnt get money. i didnt grt refund as well. lost 600 bucks. ruined my evening as well,1
This app hang a lot .. tried updating it.. reinstall it every time placing the order this time it's the worse got errors code E3 on the screen was trying to tap on it couple of times but in the end my order was cancelled and they even not deliver the item nor I got the money refunded.,1
"Price are fake in all restaurants. The Actual price in menu in hotels and restaurants are lower than what is showing in zomato, If you buy home delivery from hotel it's better. Edited- We cannot keep sending you all the list.What you offer in gold and now whatever upgrade(downgrade) you made and what you charge as tax, packing, charge of delivery is just fake things to add it to price. I saw it again to check if you have updated the price. It's still same. 30% more than restaurant.",1
"Zomato is doing fraud , by taking veil of cancellation fee , Charging in appropriately for cancelled order. I was checking out my order , any due to some techical issue a placed it due to mistake. I cancelled it in very next minute , but still zomato said restaurant started preparing order. Practically every restaurant takes 15 minutes to prepare an order. Where as i cancelled my order in very next minute of placing it. BUT THEY Charged whole order amount as cancellation fee . SCAM , UNISTAAL IT",1
Very good service,4
"Horrible experience. They frequently cancel the orders, especially when you are eagerly waiting for it. Their policies are rigid and unreasonable and are only made to cause inconvenience to the customers.When asked to cancel an order that I place by mistake, the zomato agents forced me to accept it, since their 'revised'policy doesn't allow them to cancel the order without the cancellation fee. They argued fr 1/2 hr pointlessly and and after the torture,cancelled the order saying I lack patience",1
"I have successfully complet the payment, still it is writing payment incomplete. No one listen my problem. I showed all the proof but my money get wasted. I'll never do this mistake. Very bad experience. Even after saying my problem and giving all the proof there is no response no action. My money😫😫😫😫",1
"Re-use the old version, the new version is absolutely the worst, this app used to be useful, now it's so bad. Again, if the old version is not back, u will have a huge number uninstall it, starting with me :)",1
"Its a mixed experience. Zomato deliveries have too many extra charges and over taxed, container charges. Worst app to place the delivery. Even zomato Gold for delivery and morst worst with more charges then usual restaurant on Gold restaurants. No offer available for payments Zomato Gold is only good for weekly visitors. Very less options available around.",2
their customer service is not good.. and for refunding.. they didn't delivered last time to the same address which they used deliver all the time. and the person who took my order was in wrong place & didn't even tried to reach me & they didn't refunded the money & telling a reason like I gave them wrong address. I'm done with their app..,1
"Customer service is appreciable. Better than some competitors. Availability of delivery agents is also good. Taxes charged are a bit too much. Also, if there are some active promocodes available, please suggest them in suggestions.",4
"Chat support system is very bad. Money is deducted, but order is not placed. They are telling this is payment gateway failure. Please order using other payment gateway. How funny is this. My money is deducted. They are not returning money. again I will order",1
Best and Cheapest prices on every restaurant. Delivery boy are polite and service is better than best. I would suggest you all using ZOMATO to order your food online. Everything ranging from chilled ice-cream to sizzler is available at a price everyone can afford. Orders are fresh and yummy to. I would prefer to give 7stars to this app. THANK YOU ZOMATO 👍👍👍,5
"Very bad service.. food was not delivered and no refund possible.. while trying to talk to the helpline. They are saying it's against their policies. Really, what kind of service are you trying to offer. Don't you have value for money",1
worst app.... I made d payment for my order.. the Amount was debited but it was showing that payment not done & hence order not completed... if ull don't receive d order why ull receive d payment...? tried calling help line no... which was not connecting for a long time.. MARGAO zomato dint have their own help line no... when connected help line they dint listen also to d problem,1
It is one of the worst app I have ever used with bogus in-app chat customer support. Restaurants cancel the order on its own. Even when you are waiting for the order since it showed food is being prepared.,1
I just ordered a restuarant and valet arrived on different location and denied to come at my location saying that he is on the same location as given in app and denied to come while i have ordered on same location several times but then i cancelled my order and neither amount nor food was delivered and also they do not have any policy to reorder the cancelled order. Wow Zomato...Wow....na khana na refund....aise khilaoge india ko..,1
I never even though about ordering food online.But one 4 a.m i was so hungry i downloaded the app and i was amazed to see soo many delicious foods i can eat without moving anywhere at that time.And to my surprise they were cheap too considering i got whatever i want from whatever restaurant and it got deliverd to my home too.Lovin Zomato.I will always use it.,5
"Add an aggregator this is a good so but terrible when it comes to delivery. Their handling of issues when it comes to delivery is terrible and badly informed, like during delivery fees for replacing a missing item in your order.",2
"I booked an order through the zomato app. After sometime, a message came saying no rider was assigned and hence we r cancelling the order! I called up the restaurant, they said my order is ready nd packed, just that no one has come to pick up the order. I then talked to customer executive, where the person assigned to me was so irritating! Not only the person was saying that they cant do anything, after a long time, aftr wasting my time, the person is offering me a refund and a mere 50 rs coupon",1
Very slow i dont like this app,1
"Zomato is great. Zomato gold is a joke. Consistently changing the policies without informing their customers. I had to pay full price due to the change in policy of only one unlock per day. I called up zomato customer service and they told me its because i didnt update the app. A forced app update through the app could of solved the issue on informing your customers. They offered me a membership refund but even though i have 11 month left but they will only refund $26, i payed $45 for the year.",1
The food ordered is not delivered correctly. Missing items are seen always. The restaurant as well as the delivery person are not making sure whether the ordered items are correct. The customer is made to suffer. Very bad indeed. Today morning I ordered three Idli sets from Kalyan and one vada was. missing. A few days back the Idli ordered from hotel Nandhini was not eatable and we had to throw it away. Then how am I to rate you. I lost my money and there is no action on your part.,1
"When we have option having like delivery and self pick up why not listed restaurants showing like dineout restaurants we don't want them in online order app don't show whenever we search for online order placing, the search results out side restaurants those are not available online order are showing is very stupid idea just saparate the app or do mention that different sections only shows search results online order only don't compare two of them",1
i dont want zomato. They are big cheating app. Poor delivey . They asked me to apply promo code as I applied they denied the deliver after waiting one hour they did even alloted the valet.i am uninstalling this app Rubbish Zomato. Get lost Zomato made me.to wait one and half an hour,1
wonderful app😊 very useful and simple to use. But the support is worst. even when the wait time is 1min..it has no replies even after half hour..it simply doesn't sustain customer care test and hence fails to serve the purpose many times.,2
"Worst service. i used the app and had food get delivered many times. Suddenly, i got my account blocked for which when enquired with zomato they replied your account is permanently banned because of suspicious activity. when i try to get what activity does my profile reflected, they blocked me from sending mails. So does this reflect ZOMATO is a scam, which provides inedible and rancid food looting people of their hunger and doesnt give atleast fundamental information to the user.",1
Very good service,5
"very good app for ordering food online. Easy payment methods and very friendly courier service. Been using zomato for more than a year i guess and though they had some hiccups that annoyed me, still it is a pretty good app to order food. Plus they provide coupons which is a good thing.",5
"On time, contact less delivery done. Xlent.",5
"They should keep themselves to food delivery,",1
Very unprofessional. After 45 minutes of waiting the delivery boy called me and said I will not deliver food in your area. I used to order from them every other day. they have no control over their delivery boys. Contacted their customer care which is equally useless. They were of no help. It seems these delivery boys are running their business.,1
Order get delayed most of the time. Sometimes when contacted delivery person or restaurant they said we have called you but no one pick up the calls while i havn't received the call. Even today when i ordered from gurgaon and delivery boy called me it got connected to somewhere in Mumbai and delivery boy returned without delivering the package.,1
becoming worst order by order chat people doesn't support after 11hr of order they want immediate feedback with photo.Even dropping mail don't work they will say please try to understand every time .Better you people try other app for food delivery. my Request #866157 number.I have asked help from both channels via mail (vishal kumar)& chat(dont know the names) N guys plz dont forget 2 take selfies with food else they seriously don't entertain you becoz they prefer pic of food more then ur words.,1
first of all gold zomato is a joke! so many conditions and very little offers and overall isn't worth the price. secondly the support chat is the worst! they reply very late or they dont at all and even ifff they do they're very inefficient. I used to like this app but unfortunately recently im having bad experiences with them constantly,1
"Easily one of the most intrusive apps out there. The ""unsubscribe"" option at the bottom of their emails doesn't work. Contacting them is a dead end, and their notifications never seem to stop even after restricting them from phone settings. Horrible horrible end user experience",1
No restaurant near by.,1
"Is it just me or has the app been behaving super buggy all of a sudden? It keeps logging you out on it's own, and has been more often than not failing to show results with an error, abruptly. Zomato?",3
Not all food hubs are available in our area. Sometimes it shows some restaurants and other days it doesn't. Idk why it has to happen when I have got to order something. Please take a note on this.,2
"As a Food Delivery App : One star . Pathetic customer service, 100 percent cancellation charges. I ordered through this app, The order was not picked up even after 45 mins( which has to be delivered with 30 mins), Then cancelled , i was not returned my money.",1
When i book for my favourite dish it will not be available with the Resturant and they will cancel the order. This happen for me 2 times this week. My suggestion zomato need to update to remove the unavailable dishes from the list. So no one will get cancel there order .,1
"Good app.. But still there is room for improvement.. Some good non vegetarian restaurants are not listed here.. Further, they take delivery charges even if the distance between the food joint and my home is less than 5 kms..",4
"Pathetic support. have been waiting to get my zomato credits for more than a month for the order which was never to be placed. Each time support assured of credits to be updated in 24hrs but never happened.. And lastly they said i have too many credit requests so i wont be getting any credits. Man..! We earn money hard way, not to waste on apps like you. Uninstalling it. Hope your competitors are good.",1
"Very poor, pathetic service . They claim so much and their service is the worst. After an hour of placing order they call to confirm your order has been cancelled because we are unable to locate the restaurant. Seriously.",1
it should be zero stars. They didnt call me after i made an order and then they said that they are cancelling it since i didnt pick up the call. this is even after they have my delivery address and they have delivered here tons of times. After all the bogus they charged me the entire order amount as cancellation charge even after talking with customer care for hours. dont ever order.,1
"so far the experience has been awesome. The delievery personnel are well behaved, seeking confirmation ahead of handing over the parcel if the said parcel contains the items ordered for. I have had some complains with the restaurant but I have had no troubles with any of the delievery personnel.",4
The agents assigned for delivery are highly unprofessional and have no sense of good communication. The chat agents also lie about the delivery boy's current location. Earlier zomato was one of the best online food ordering apps. It has just gotten worse over time.,1
"I mailing to the support from august to remove false penalty charges of 400. They agreed for it and promised me rhat they remove within 48hrs. But actually not removed. Whenever i ask the support for issue, they simply reply ""there are operation problems , within 48hrs we remove penalty'. I have all thei mails. My registered zomato no is 88zero174168six.",1
"Zomato gives poor service, payment fails and customer don't even get the return, customer service representative talk about blocking the customer, we don't get any help here that's why it's useless. . .i suggest people to use the merchant's app directly at least you will get what you pay for her Zomato will not give you anything but will take your money....!",1
"worst service...👎👎 everytime i order food, its not sure whether you'll get it or not, or after one hour if you ask them where is the food, they tells you sorry we cant deliver the food... today they cancelled my 3 orders and i ordered food at 3pm waited for long time then called them they said sorry we cant deliver it to you... i ordered again from different place still same thing they rejected order and for third time.. their rider is still not delivering... really poor service zomato provides",1
I've placed an order and made an online payment. Amount has been credited from my account but the restaurant says that the payment was not received and suggested me to take the issue to Zomato. But Zomato help was not accessible. No idea of what to do and whom to contact. Lost my money. Very worst experience. Uber eats was far better.,1
"🔥🔥The best food delivery App in kolkata. Makes a boring, depressing day, joyful and happy instantly with added discount coupons that ranges throughout the year. Excellent behavior of delivery personels. Super fast and unadulterated service. All together, my go to app on a tired and lonely day!!",5
The worst experience I had on 16th of feb... ordered a pizza with extra charge to deliver on time...after every step of acceptance n preperation of order...I get a call after about 30-40 minutes that your order can't be fulfilled n u can order from some other place and the guy just cut the phone...after talking to the representative...he told me that the road is closed...the issue was that they wouldn't have delivered the order on time n I had chosen on time delivery..didn't wanna pay back money,1
Need to improve on pricing,3
Over charged All the dishes are overcharged by 30-50rs as compared to the restaurant mrp. Plus taxes and delivery charges are seperate. I understand that taxes have to be applied but why to do fraud in the mrp of the item. This is really crazzyy..gona uninstall it and rather order it directly from the restaurant n pay decent delivery charges only.,1
"Zomato seems to be malfunctioning. I've ordered a couple of times and never ran into any trouble. But recently, the app refuses to open and claims ""something went wrong..."". I'll be glad if you guys can work on it.",1
This is the platform for looting money from customers as they revise their policies and expect customers to read them all every time before placing order. i cancelled my order by mistake after 2 mins of placing and they debited the entire amout as penalty of cancellation. Be ready to waste your money after intalling it.,1
Excellent Food And Service,5
zomato app has stopped working on my phone all of a sudden. It was working fine for a week and now its not working at all. On the screen it comes up as something went wrong and to try again later. I emailed this problem but zomato has not even replied. Very unhappy uninstalling now.,1
"Forcefully they send coupons even when they send wrong orders, sometimes order takes more than an hour to get delivered but the do nothing about it ans when they deliver even 1 minute early my phone floods with notifications they they delivered superfast. Worst service, use swiggy it's much better.",1
"the new user interface is not at all user friendly. I cant even check basic info like my zomato wallet balance or payment options on my account or the saved address book. with new updates, browsing the app is increasingly tougher. hope your app development team does a better job on user friendliness",1
"Extremely poor experience. Restaurants show 30 minutes delivery before you order food, but shows 2 hours after the order. The customer support executives refuse to help. Absolute sell out. The ratings, delivery times and the reviews are all paid.",1
"On time door delivery unlike most apps who asks you to come to a convenient location for them to pickup. Very much satisfied with this service except for a very few instances. But hey every bunch has a few, Wil not say exactly bad apples but you got the gist. Keep up this level of service.",5
Firstly display in your if the restaurant can deliver food to the selected address or not and whether the order is delivered by zomato or the partner restaurant instead of getting the order cancelled later due to delivery location issue worst service swiggy and uber eats is a lot better option we have i guess uninstalling the app after posting this review,1
So this happened with me for the 2nd time order was placed payment was done online..then the oder was on way but then order wasn't delivered...i tried contacting zomato but at last endup in a chat service...that was even more worst they customer care wasn't able to support they are asking me to wait if the oder will not be deliver then I have to come back and explain them the same...worst services at night. Note that by 12:15 I had placed oder and its 1:30 nobody has the update about the oder.,1
"My only reason to give this app 2 star is my recently bad experience with zomato team. When zomato deliver the food before time, it brags,but if food delivery gets late they try to hide their failure , custmr care is like just doing the formality, didnt care about about the food delivery.",2
Timings does not change. Just to avoid free delivery if the time is passed. There is some bug in the app where the timings will not change at all. Actual time passes bit in the app it still be the same. Don't do like this just to avoid free delivery.,3
"Very very bad experience.they really loot people.there is no cancel option also.i once cancelled my order within seconds, that time the restaurant also haven't started to prepare my food and that delivery person also not alloted.they just like that cancelled my COD option and when I contacted them through the zomato chat their late replies and services made me even more angry...and the reply that I got from them is, they have blocked using that option from my device itself.just dont use this app!",1
I recieved my food 40 minutes after I was notified the order was already on the way (i live 3 minutes away from the restaurant I order from). When I eventually got the food I asked the delivery guy why he was so late and he literally said he had left just 5 minutes ago. this same incident has happened with 2 of my friends before. I never heard anyone say a good thing about Zamato,1
Their support executives in the chatrooms hardly give a response! Their is no customer care contact available on the app in case of help! You don't get a response from them on the email and all this when they deliver your prepaid food to somebody else and that too Making you wait for 3 hours!!,1
"the worst food ordering app. be assured to get wrong food of what u ordered. its been several times that whatever i have ordered i have received wrong order. once i ordered veg cheese momos. when i received momos nd had a bite , i got to know its simple veg momos without cheeze inside. and when i complained them they said you have opened it. sorry. u morons, unless nd until u'l not open d package nd taste it how wil you get to know whats filled inside. plz ppl jus stop ordering from this app",1
"More than fifty minutes than the time shown while ordering. And still it hasn't been delivered. While availing the customer support option, the executive says it's been delivered, when it hasn't! Pathetic customer service.",1
I ordered food through zomoto app... And done transaction through netbanking... After the transaction I opened app for tracking but the order not placed and opened that restaurant in that it's showing currently closed for online orders... After transaction how they closed... Really this is an embarrassing moment for me... Kindly refund my money...im totally frustrated,1
"Its been 1 hour and 40 minutes and m still waiting for my order. Happened with me twice in this month. And the worst part is Zomato representative (I think his name is carlo) is not replying, had just told me that the line is busy. Really disappointed with Zomato. Will surely look for an alternative.",1
Worst experience with the Support Team. I conatcted them for the faulty food and told me that the things are not in their control to either process the refund or get the food replaced. If I am spending money for the food and If I am not getting a good quality food than if refund cannot be processed I should provided with replaced food. My money just got wasted.,1
Zomato clock works in a way that no other clock works....if in reality 10 mins have passed zomato will show just 1 min up.... stop fooling people... I'm sure many more have noticed this but haven't been vocal about it... Would appreciate if zomato can be real with their time estimate rather than fooling people... and the irony of all this is even if your order is delivered in 40 mins ZOMATO will proclaim it to be deliver on 20 mins. Be honest,1
"l am a big foodie and after installing zomato it has become very convenient to order foods of different testes from different resturents. May be it is not possible for me always to reach out physically there but zomato has bridged the gap and given the opportunity to satisfy ones buds sitting at home, office or anywhere by delivering the food on behalf of yourself and also at a discounted prices via their offers occationally... big fan of ZOMATO",5
"zomato customer service is going down as their user base and sales are going up they are not able to address clients issues,first of all they didnt solved our problem, which needs to addressed at time of delivery,then even after our complain over chat and mail they didnt take any action and they are also not bother to reply us. And this total incident happed with buddha bites Madhyamgram outlet.",1
worst application... this guys are charging extra amount for not delivering the food at particular address and the delivery boys are also cancelling the order and refuse to deliver the food.... and we have to pay that order's amount as a penalty... Don't Use at all. Hate this. Not worth application.,1
"My food was not delivered couple of times. I tried to contact customers service and they did nothing. They add some misery amount of money on my wallet but in wrong currency and I have sent email but they NEVER fix it, stealing money only.Try to u use other apps for delivery",1
"We should be able to pay in LBP... All the prices are in LBP but when it comes to paying, the amount will be converted to USD same goes for gold membership, we can't renew our subscription unless we pay in $... And we are not able to use the majority of our LBP cards specially during these unusual circumstances....",1
"I love to order food from Zomato..they provide good discounts and if we face any issues,they resolve asap.",5
"You cannot track the order status like that in Swiggy. It just shows that your order is on the way, which is quite clueless. Doesn't event give details of the person who is going to deliver your food",3
"Worst application. You need to verify the restaurant first. My order is not prepared in one hour. Restaurant's phone no told as out of coverage area. Then i cancelled the order, they took my whole money as cancellation charge. Worst app.",1
I ordered Vegetable Gravy Chowmein but there are hardly any vegetables found in the dishes excepting a very few finely shreaded carrot. The colour is gray which is unlikely and the taste is not good. No packets of sauce and/or chilli in vinegar was provided. Hope better dishes next time.,1
i ordered from pune. order was not delivered. but Zomato valet did in that system that's order is delivered. and i am trying to contact Zomato service chat around 1 hour. that time it was showing chat wait time was 1 minutes. and after half an hour again it was showing wait time is 1 minutes. This is the service Zomato is giving to the customer. its very very pathetic. tum log customer sirf bewokoof bana sakte ho. ur kuch nhi.,1
"loving this app, its fascilities, the cash backs, the user supports as well. I just want that the delivery guys should cross check the order while taking the food from the hotels so that there are no mistakes or mismatch of orders.",5
"best among the present running good delivery apps. It provides the best offers, yes apart from that the tenacity of food condition going through all those traveling (very swift), it remains the same until it reaches us. The app interactivity is very smooth, and robust with its timely updates.",5
very bad after order service .the food supplied by this delivery app is the worst . i received the food from the same restaurant from different delivery apps and zomato delivery sucks . they dont have a refund or replacement for the mistakes they do like spillage etc . highly recommend swiggy and uninstall zomato. the way customer service person talks is also rude .,1
An option to cancel the order should be there for the customer . You can charge a reasonable fine for the cancellation either from the next order or else from the current order if the customer has already made payment then deduct from that.,4
"I was an order place that I was supposed to meet at 10:43 am but it was 40 minutes late because of your rider. Your rider was available at the wrong location, which I reported to your chat support but he also very unresponsive to me and Cancelling my order was more important instead requesting a call back again and again, I did not get any call. i was received 3 promo code which is un-useful for me and had faced very pathetic customer service your agent instead of provided solutions.",1
"i had the worst experience ever. The waiting time for my order was for more than 2hrs and when I cancelled them, i didn't get the refund. when i contacted the Support, they said that I would get my refund in 48hrs. this cycle repeated for 3times and when I contacted the support again, they were saying that as I've cancelled the order I wouldn't get the refund and asked me to register my complaint through mail. The worst part is, they didn't respond to my mail though it's been 5days already",1
"Pathetic app. Worst experience today. We ordered food on zomato and the delivery never took place! The money was deducted from our card, without providing service!!! Upon follow up about whereabouts of the order, zomato chat person answered that the restaurant personnel is out for delivery and hence his contact number could not be traced!! This is unacceptable and highly unprofessional. Zomato shud pu up their app as there are multiple choices customers have open in the market like ubereats.",1
"i don't want to rate this app ,it is completely poor ,if you pay the money in card ,the deduct it,and saying ur order is cancelled automatically and keeping the money and not refundeing if asked it is service and cancellation charge deducted..this is the new way for cheating",1
Options are good But customer service is downright stupid. Order was placed without my consent. And when they cancelled they said you have to pay penalty. If I haven't Ordered then why the penalty? Used to like this app but now the app is just a waste of time.,2
Lovely place with great ambience and tasty food. The service was quick too. Was recommended by a friend and it did live up to the expectations. Tried 4 dishes there and all were nice ( pics added) 1. Sarson ka saag & Makke ki roti 2. Aaloo pyaaz ki sabzi & Bejar ki roti 3. Dal makhni & Laccha paratha 4. Chur Chur naan with Amritsari Chola,5
"Bad customer support,they cancel orders according to their wish after making customer wait for an hour or so and if by mistake an order is placed by the customer and even at the same time customer makes request about the wrong order they say that they can't help now , specially such situation occurs when amount had already been debited From the customers wallet. Hoping for best solution to the problem me ND other customers are facing. Really have great hope from zomato but till now not satisfied at all.",1
It's easy to order food and get delivery fast. I am recommending to use this App,5
Very good service nice,5
Complicated the Coupon system.,3
Worst worst and worst.... first of all they confirm the order and after 30-40minutes they will call you and say sorry for inconvenience unfortunately your order has been cancelled by the merchant. They always blame merchant for their mistakes. I faced this issue twice or thrice. They don't deserve even a single star... 😡,1
So yeah I have been facing a refund issue related to a certain order . They have accepted their fault but when it comes to paying back the amount these guys won't listen . Their help support center is pathetic they will ask you to wait for 24-48 hrs once that time period has elapsed they will again ask you for another 24-48 hrs ... Trust me guys if there is money related issue they simply won't help you . I have send them mail's had long long conversation for hours but they just won't listen .,1
One of the worst service ever.... Always failed to deliver... This is the third time where my order get cancelled without informing to me.. Later when i called the restaurant they tell us that they are trying to cancell the order but not processing... Even the zomatto call center not responding the call.... I suggest never use the service of zomatto.. instead go for swiggy or ubereat... they provide much better servise than zomatto,1
"Folks be careful while ordering, They'll just take your money there will be no refund or delivery if you cancel it. @zomato Do you know the meaning of cancellation? Cancel means customer expects refund. You're just taking their money for free. You're not doing both, refund or delivery.",1
Whenever I am trying to order something from any restaurant in my area it always shows not available since no valet available in the area. However for other apps the valets are always available. This is just disappointing from Zomato. It was a waste to purchase the pro membership. Total loss of money.,5
"They are very costly guys.. For the same order we are paying 375 in the restaurant and for the same thing they are charging 663 from us even from same restaurant (wat a Burger) Although i can understand there may be delivery charges but yes it should not be more than Rs. 50. I am highly disappointed and dissatisfied from Zomato in terms of charges, trust me they are Really pathetic.",1
Pathetic service... order is not delivered on time in most cases! The app doesn't detect the location correctly.... the restaurants they have tied up with deliver themselves mostly and take double the time to deliver than that is mentioned in the app.... totally misleading the customer,1
"good return of investment.. you've got review before you got in restaurant , so you have better choice before choose, yet you only spend not much for got gold member for a whole year !! i'll recommend this to everyone whom enjoy goes around searching good food and got info from it..",5
"Previously they were giving us Nice offers but not now I expect more good offers from your side Thank you apart from this ,app is very good ui &contents are attractive",3
They are in to unetical business practices. I have placed one order through them and cancelled the order accidentally. We have placed order for same food from same restaurant again. They are not refuning the amount of first order as they claim that restaurant will charge them money. I have gone and met restaurant. They have shared the details and they have received only once order which they have served. That means for sum of small money zomato is bluffing. We have collected evidence also.,1
"I had ordered it many times...but after somtimes,there was some transaction failure,zomato paid me only 33rupess. Then tonight,i had ordered twice through net banking,my account was debited. But the ordered had failed. The customer service ignored my complaint. I will file an FIR because i dont want this thing to happen to other. I am MCom student",1
"Pathetic customer service, they will show estimated time half and will deliver food in one and half hour, no proper response from customer care they will take hours to reply, it is better we go personally and buy food than paying to them, they are making money out of our hunger without proper service.",1
"Wonderful app. but the delivery costs fluctates very fast, as if we were playing a game of monopoly.... and also the order doesn't deliver to me, but delivers to a building ,a yard away from me!..small things like these do matter....please take care of these.👍",3
Worst app ever experienced I had order rolls due to the technical error at there app my delivery address was mark down wrong and due. Which I had to cancel my order and I was penalised for that and I have not yet got any reply over my mail and moreover they don't have and customer support team as well pathetic organisation.,1
I had a worst experience on ordering food from box8. I have been befooled by saying the order has been received late fron zomato and zomato chat doesn't have a support either.Till now it has been a hour and I'm unable to track the person and receive the order.I 'm going to uninstall the app and never to order from zomato and box8 as well. Not going to help with the order no. Ps:- zomato marketing team.,1
Uber eats was much better. There is no refund policy whatever the quality or quantity of food may be. Had issues many times.... they just provide some nonsense code for flat off which is of no use as other codes give more discount than this. Worst experience,1
"Awesome? It is mind-blowing! Being a regular customer of online food ordering sites, I'd say, zomato is the best among them all. Especially the 'free delivery' scheme of zomato as opposed to other online food apps is really good.",5
Good application and awesome experience with Gold. Only issue is with tracking where important numbers are missing. It can be made more user friendly like the interface used by your competitors but overall still I like it.,4
"When I have issues, I don't want to speak with a robot. Learn from swiggy. There has to be someone with whom we can register the complaint.. I got less quantity in one of my previous order and the bot told that it will tell the restaurant to take care next time.. But the question is, who will give my remaining order..",2
"No phone line to call. We can only chat, where representatives respond messages once in 20 minutes. My orders cancelled twice after waiting for 45 minutes each. Any issue, zomato says, it is our responsibility to call restaurant and the rider.",1
it was my first and last worst experience with zomato. ordered food online and system automatically places 2 order and then zomato apply cancellation charge = order value even i tried to get in touch with Zomato support and surprisingly they appear online after 45 minute when waiting time was 7 minutes. .worst application and worlds worst customer support preparing documents to lodge complaint on consumer forum. think twice while ordering through this garbage application.,1
very unreliable app... you can be sure that it will malfunction two times out of five... very unreliable service too... they cancel at the last minute and you don't even get a message or call informing you till you follow up with them,2
"Customer service is non existence. Chat support takes forever to respond and delivery takes 2 hours or more. Support simply answers to wait, they do not have any rules or method to track drivers. Their drivers are not professional at all. Waste of money and your time. Better use swiggy or Uber eats. Or direct delivery.",1
"I really thank to Zomato because they provide good service and door to door sercive which is really very very very helpful in todays busy life.its really very hard for the Zomato delivery boy to find out the exact location and provide hot food hot and cold one cold on a perfect time and this all is possible with the gard work of Zomato.we get the food in rest position at home , office , colleges etc . so thank u so much and help we people like this further .",5
"App needs improvement like swiggy...... if multiple delievery address exist in profile, in last step of order there shall be Confirmation for delivery address...... I lost my Rs133 because of that..... Food to be delievered at office address but while ordering the food app selected my default home address.",1
Very good service,5
Good and safe,5
Very bad experience they locked my cash on delivery option and when asked for the reason they justied me ...Try to pay through card this time and they will unlock my COD option after that but still COD option is not available..And when I went to online ordering help option to ask about this it is not opening....Zomato You are thinking your customers are fool...And yes I am shifting to another food app there service is much better then you.,1
Best Kattering app,5
So fast delivery,3
"I ordered from zomato but I did a mistake of putting the wrong address and I placed the order but just after placing the order, the next minute, I informed the restaurant that the address is wrong and I want to correct the address, the restaurant confirmed me that they will let the delivery agent know about my proper address, but the delivery agent being stubborn, insisted that he is going to deliver in the wrong address rather than the correct address. He asked for extra money also👎👎👎",1
Very good service,5
Excellent support team. However restaurants take too long. They also can't read the address. The discounts over zomato are nice but simply calling is easier than this hassle. Will improve the rating once the above is fixed.,3
"Such chat agents and template replies, no one wants to resolve anything and want to just tell that they will provide feedback to the hotel, how the hell does providing feedback help.. I'm still losing my money and either giving the food to the dogs or having to eat.. that is! If it is edible.. it very much seems like you just don't give a f ... At the same time I was abused by an agent.. by the way I have written to Zomato 2 or 3 days ago.. still no response",1
"self experience, i have given zero rating because, the food which i order by this app packing was improper, less quantity,and taste less, some items were missing. and delivery boy has not given change(money). it is better to go and have in hotel. zomato has tagged with useless hotels.",1
Pethatic they said will give refund for late delivery never received,1
"Its an excellent app, easily accessible! Saves time and money. Foodies would love it as they can order food anywhere and at anytime! Though some changes needs to be done yet it is a reliable source!",5
careless service. when there is a strick then it should have been informed earlier. I ordered a food the order was accepted but it never reached the destination. waited for almost an hour.,1
"Hello Friends, this food delivery app steal people's food and deliver the eaten food.Their delivery boys are very smart, they handover the order and before reconfirming they will run away. the order was received by my small daughter as she can not check the same. after complaining to customer service they ask for image, but my child was not aware what I order for her(I order online when I was not at home) unknowingly she ate whatever came.So recommend you to do not use this app.",1
This is in concern with the order placed on 17 March 2019. I placed this order at 8:53. And the I have paid through phone pay the app was displaying status as payment pending even after the successful payment even the help support for the app was not working and was giving error 3 something. I called ur costumer care and asked cancel and he assured i ll get a refund where as now u people are telling i wont get . do u expect a person to wait for 1 hr to get the order confirm.,1
"The delivery people are utter useless. They can't find the address or look at directions. They can't evn speak Hindi or English. Their profile says they can talk in Englishand Hindi, but thats a lie. Find better people with sense to serve. This is the second time I'm complaining about the same issue. And the customer care is even useless. The texting service is pointless.",1
Very bad app. I ordered some food and canceled it by the very next min but still zomato is adding that bill to my next orders and I will have to pay for that cancelation too if I order next time. That's really not worthy and this should be solved.,1
Such a waste service .. my prepaid order is not delivered to me .. and as per delivery boy he delivered it to another flat .. it has been 2 hours i m waiting for my order this afternoon and chatting with customer support ..even you guys don't have a call support to speak .. after requesting so many times to chat support to call me .. he didn't even call and I didint get my order and refund as well .. the delivery guys are not at all professional l.. they don't know how to talk to customers .waste,1
Worst customer service in the world. Their customer care doesn't give a damn and has the audacity to actually quit the chat even as you are trying to explain your problem. It seems their time is too precious for customer concerns. They state with a don't give a damn attitude and will go to the extreme to test your patience. So if you wish to talk with them ever keep it short as zomato customer care is too busy to actualy bear with you.,1
"Though the zomato service is good overall , but the customer care is the worst. No one cares to reply, there are no numbers available to directly connect to the executives....the numbers available over the Internet says that they are incorrect, doesn't exist...I have also had a few bad experiences with zomato....you should improve your customer care service and provide a number where people can directly connect to the executive if required.",4
"I am having great experience with zomato. There are other options available but I find it the best. Easily accessible, everything is in order and understandable format, no fake offers and quality restaurants.",5
*Disappointed with service* Its my first experience and i got my order more than one hour late. Delivered food was not even warm to eat. *Good* The 2 good things are got 50% off and got food at home thats why i gave one star only for this. *Suggestion* 1. After selection of an order you have to infor us about the time it takes to deliver 10-15 minutes up or down don't matter. 2. If it takes near about hour or more then one hour like my case than gave the facily to change order.,1
It used to be a good 3rd party application to supply food at home location but charging 55rs taxes on food.. is really a shame.. I don't know what kind of algorithm they use to charge taxes.. Thinking to drop off the application and never use it again.,1
"I have already written the right address, but even though zomato called me and said to collect my order from some destination. This is too worst and ridiculous, the zomato itself told us that we can't allow our delivery boy to deliver on the location that you have written. So I had to collect from the location they said. IF WE ALREADY WANTED TO COLLECT THEN WHY WOULD WE ORDER FROM ZOMATO, WE COULD DRIVE AND COLLECT IT. shame on the service of zomato. Swiggy and uber eats are far more better.",1
"Very bad, because they just keep saying that there won't be any issue next time but every second order has an issue. they say they've system limitation and can call only restaurant but cannot call the customer to hear the concern. Zomato, you can do better than this.",1
"Waste, everytime showing error ""Online delivery is blocked due to suspicious behavior"", i drop multiple mail to zomato customer care but they haven't sort out the issue..!! Finally going to uninstall the app, prefer other food ordering app for hassle free deliveries.",1
worst app for food... i have ordered food through online payment but when delivery boy was near to deliver me it said u denied the order and whn i tried to call their care what they dont have there customer care support ... and you have to chat for your complain and the f*****g boy/girl was writing that they called me and i cancel the order. 😡😡😡,1
"Had a very bad experience with my order , ordered food had an item missing in it .initiated a chat with the customer care they say "" the restaurant says the food items where correctly handed over to delivery guy ""but i did not receive all the food items can you please check with the delivery guy they say he's not reachable and was told to go and check with the restaurant or treat this as an exception and write a review on the restaurants page and leave.",1
"zomato dosent deverve even that one star.. they take orders and later once payment is done they say the item ordered is out of stock, and till date its been over a month i am still awaiting my refund . a similar incident just today, placed my order paid the amount and the. later get a call we do not deliver in your area .. If such is the case why ist it mentioned in the app . Zamato is just here to fool people a d take their money .. foolish app",1
"its terrific. I can check all the restaurents around my area, their menu & prices, which i couldnt have even visited or may not visit in future also but i can order from them.. though offers are also very good compared to the oruginal prices... vthe lication servuce and delivery also great..",5
"Pathetic Delivery. Zomato team not contactable!! The Estimated time of delivery was 30 minutes. It took more than 1.5 Hours after the delivery boy (from the restaurant itself and not from Zomato) to even receive the call. Meanwhile, I contacted the restaurant who were unresponsive. I called them some 15 times before they received my call. The delivery boy who was contacted with utmost difficulty made multiple pretexts and tried to fool us. Happened also with a friend.",1
"The app is good, but please give a cancellation window of 60 seconds or something to avoid duplicate orders. Along with chat service in customer care, phone calls would also be preferred for quick resolution.",3
Nice app and service. Good keep it up,4
"Everything was fine but last week i ordered a food on 7.30 AM and they could confirmed the order and take the money too and till 9.30 they didn't updated any thing regarding my delivery at last i was pinging them countinusly but their AI was responding ""your food is cooking,wait for a while"" after 3 hrs (10.30) their customer responded ""please cancel your order the product can't deliver bcz employee is not available their"" अगर यही चीज पहले बता देते तो कही और से करते order time भी नही जाता|",2
Horible delivery experience happened to us. Paid approx 600 + in advance for pizza delivery from slice of italy but delivered pizza was messed up. May be pizza box was fallen and delivery boy quietly delivered the box and left as it was a prepaid order. Followed up with Zomato team but poor response. Greedy company. Pls be careful and never pay in advance. Always check your order before payment.,1
"worst ever app i encountered in my life.it cheats customer by forcing order on them. They will not give you option to select payment or choose it and it doesn't have cancel option once order is placed. Sometimes, it clicks by mistake then atleast customer should have atleast one minute to cancel it. Even their customer support is worst and unsupportive.they will not reply you fast, they will try to waste your time and will never cancel your order on timevand will scold you with heavy penalty.",1
"Zomato is a pretty nice app for finding good places to eat and the review board is pretty helpful. Zomato gold is a great offer and is definitely a must-have for foodies. However, I feel like there could be more places that Zomato allows delivery from and I wish there were a few more places under gold",5
"Yes it is the worst app ever i have experienced. Waste of money and time. I was using this app earlier but now i switched to other.. What the company is doing, they don't have knowledge...... I suggest others to use other apps like uber swiggy etc.. I have mailed regarding the order issue which i have placed on 18th oct... But no use and no reply",1
Worst app treat their delivery patners worst than slaves... And I have a proof of it... Pls use other ecommerce app like swiggy.. atleast their delivery patner work on their own.,1
"I think the previous release of this app was more convenient and user friendly, now to reach your area restaurants are more inside, alot of segments making it more confusing, over all performance, support is good.",4
"please pay attention and better avoid using them , I never recieved my order and support team keep asking me to wait 10 to 15 mins and order will reach me , they claim the restaurant is not answering their calls but when I called the restaurant they pick up immediately , they are trying to fool customers and when I asked them to cancel the order they tell me according to protocol we can't cancel your order,but their protocol allow them to take ur money without delivering ur meal!!!!!!",1
There is no option to cancel the order. We need to pay cancellation fee for it even when the restaurant is running late for order. Very very late delivery than given time. Need to improve that or give free cancellation for such orders,1
Super and fast delivery thanku,5
"It's very good app, specially for students or job holder who r staying in hostel or accommodation. I m changing my review today because i m really dispointed about it.i order chicken biryani, payment has done but the zomato valet person told he didn't receive any order on my name ,Ganisetti is the person who delivered someone else. its redicolus",4
Terrible experience with dinner orders. Had to leave home many days at 12 am to check for restaurants. Multiple times food never got delivered. Chat bot doesn't work at all. Shows wait time as 15 mins and even after 2 hours no response. Restaurant number provided is always wrong. #heightofcheating,1
It's an amazing app previously I was using some other application to order food online but then I thought to give a try to zomato...it's actually good.we can order anything anytime..and customer support is also very awesome. They actually do care for your taste and money.,5
Was in love with this app but once I had query about my food then I realized how bad this is. No inclination towards the customer despite giving the pics of the item delivered they did nothing. Never seen such a app who doesn't bother about their customer! Would never recommend to anyone in future.,1
"Zomato is pathetic in bangalore. It won't survive until it updates it's core ineffciences and does it fast. It's like a chain contact struggle between the restaurant and the customer and the icing on the cake are the delivery valets Zomato has added the option of tipping these nincompoops who cannot read basic gps locations, have no idea of local addresses, do not have the enthusiasm to deliver to door and by chance if you miss communication they'll cancel your order. I tried reaching out to live chat support , but they are of no help either. Sheet app don't download",3
Horrible services now. I would highly recommend to go for some other options. Had my order's cancelled 3 times after an hour delay. And today they declined the order without refunding my debits. Really hope there was a negative rating on Google Play.,1
Worst experience happened ... i have been using this app for a while but just now when i cancelled the order within seconds because i accidently clicked the button ... i was charged a penalty of whole amount of 109 rs .. there was a delay in your message delivery .. it dint show me anything regarding the penalty to which i confirmed .. this very wrong on your part .. how can you charge whole amount for penalty !!! Atleast some refund or atleast RECONFIRM option must be givenn,1
Great app and service... Best is the live tracking and chat option. And mostly within 1 min or 2 some or other executive with be available.. live tracking is very very useful if there is any delay whatis actually causing the delay and can act accordingly...,5
Very bad customer service.I contacted 3times regarding my refund which was promised by representative after cancellation of my food over chat. three of representatives had given false statements over chat and you people dont have policies to even check who made that mistake and why everyone is giving false commitment instead of telling truth to the customers. more interesting part is if we ask for supervisor or anything else they directly said not possible. this is the way you give services??,1
"Can't place order since last 2 days.. i fill in the address and then when I click on next, to locate on map.. it goes blank and the app stops right there. i don't know why that's happening. Everything else was fine!",3
"Worst support payments, no way to contact Zomato on a failed order placement and chat supporters are taking 10 mins to respond. and their response after 10 mins when I explained the scenario is ""Hey"" this ""I dont care its not my problem"" attitude is just what makes it more worse than it already is.",1
Does not respond worst service,1
Very Nice. Specially I like the feature of adding cooking Instructions.... it's very handy and affordable ❤️,5
"What is with the new app. Doesn't show my saved payment methods and nor am I being able to select. Not a network issue at all, the app has become really slow. And the font is really small which strains my eye! Whyyyyyy. The older one was way better!!!",3
"After uber eats aquisition many of my favourite places are not delivering in Zomato. Swiggy already increased it's price, so customers are pretty much screwed. Now customers are getting crushed in the monopoly of these two. We don't have option but to change our habits of ordering food online i guess. Zomato should bring atleast quality restaurants for food ordering. Can't order just anything because of offers.",2
worst experience...after an hour of accepting the order they said that it cant be delivered and even the amount will not be refunded! Better to use Swiggy which at least tells beforehand which restaurant will deliver or not! The call support person was very rude and not cooperative at all..,1
If a restaurant is not accepting or is closed for orders then there is no need to show it in the list of online ordering. It is frustrating when i am hungry but after opening a menu it won't take an order. Or give a filter to sort only restaurants that are serving as in the Go Out list Thank you.,3
Zomato doesnot manage delivery whereas it is the responsibility of restaurants to do that. this is what i got to know from zomato when my order delayed by 30+ min and Zomato is clueless about tracking my order.. If Zomato doesnt manage delivery then what for we use Zomato for booking order.. I had to eat stone cold pizza which was delivered after 1.5 hrs after placing the order.. thanks Zomato..,1
"I had rated the app as 5 stars and I still do think that it is the best food delivery platform in Dubai. However I revised my rating to 1 star since Zomato tried to sell me Zomato Gold with the 75 aed Zomato credit promotion. However, there was no mention that the promo code Gold should be used. 5 minutes after the purchase customer service could not assist either to cancel my order or to provide me with the advertised promotion. Deceptive advertising and shady money grab tactics. Shame!",1
Your application would crash all the d time while making payment through any gateway or UPI or wallet. It was because of that restaurant that I like a bit for which I did not uninstall the app.Fix this or I will uninstall it. My first ever review on playstore just because of crashing application all the time that got on my nerves..,1
"Zomato is very bad in service. Also they wont refund your money even if you have not received the ordered food. Their customer service is very worst & also their delivery mans are rude and non professional. The items shown in Zomato page most of the time will not available at restaurants. It is always better to use Swiggy instead of Zomato for the safety of your money. Do not encourage Zomato, because this service should be closed very soon for the sake of their fraud activities & services.",1
Very good service,5
"incompetent peole are employed to deal with customers, and that helped me have one of the horrendous customer service experience. Perhaps that's what they have been trained to do, hang up on customers or put the call on hold in middle of conversation and then again hang up. All they can do is just say generic lines that they have been taught. you guys loot people. i advice to never install this app unless you want to be ill treated. nonsense people.",1
"I had a really bad experience ordering food from zomato.Customer service for handling problem is too ignorant. usually, the wait to reach the customer service is atleast 20 minutes. Ironic considering this is a fast food delivery app. I had used other food delivery apps and they have far better app experience and prompt customer service.",1
pathetic app..mistakenly an order has been placed with a single click without adding any discount..i have tried cancelling the order but nobody helped...neither on chat nor on call..i simply ask them to add Zomato credits for the discounted amount but nobody reacted on my suggestion..really a disappointed experience and will mever use this app again...nor sugest anyone to use it...and will also pass on my experience on all social platforms available...worstttttt,1
Waste of an app. Why is this app rated 4.2? Most comments are rating 1* No customer satisfaction. Delivery not on time. Drivers go 5-6 kms away from our location and when we call them they say they r delivering something else. We have to wait for the driver according to his convenience to deliver our cold food and when we want to cancel an option comes whether to wait or cancel it but wont be refunded. Waste customer satisfaction. Take the money . And i will never order again.,1
worst online order app. There is no option to cancel the order. 50% coupon works only for 1st time. Doesn't mention the quantity of food that is to be delivered. There must be quantity given in any relative amount.,1
"Superb app, no doubt, fast delivery and delivery person also good behavior and polite, one small suggestion in chage of manu style 1. Please add real photo of item that place cook and 2. Add feture like coustomer know that they order food that spicy or not and when they order of any food they give suggestions to place at order time for food they get food is spicy or less spicy.",5
Zomato is the worst food delivery service. Uber eats was far far better. The tracking is inaccurate. Discounts are useless. Prices increased then given discounts. Horrible. Sometimes restaurants deliver to my location sometimes they say they dont deliver to the same location. Such a bad customer experience!,1
"Cannot remember the last time I received exactly those things that I ordered! I don't know whose fault that is, the restaurants or Zomato. But across all those orders, Zomato was the only constant. WHAT'S happening.",1
"The user feel of this mobile application is fine, but food delivery as a service should be worked upon and improved. Transactions should happen more seamlessly. The customer support should be more proactive.",3
Your app sucks now. Everytime while doing payment through paytm it shows me zero balance. Although i have balance in my paytm. But even after readding more money in paytm still your app shows zero balance. So atlast i am left with the option of doing payment through my bank account. Uninstalling this app.,1
Its good! It was very difficult to order food and get it delivered in the area where I work. Tried all my apps except Zomato. After trying this one happens to be the only service available! so happy. thanks zomato :),4
"Dont you guys have ""NO Star"" ratings option? 25 minutes after the placement of COD order it showed up ""Uh-oh your order could not be fulfilled."" What a useless delivering option i choose lately!!!! Atleast have some courtesy and try to explain the reason for cancellation while doing it . Good luck for your future endeavors. 👍",1
"The app sometimes does not add the promo code though it shows on the screen that it's been added. During the payment, a full amount is charged and the support says that the promo code was not applied during the payment,hence the discount was not applied. They cheat the customers..",1
Zomato delivery is good. But android app is worst as it is loading good just for the first time. From second time it is not opening. Until Uninstalling and reinstalling is happening it doesnt work. Because of this many people are not interested to place order in this app,5
I have worst experience with zomato. I am uninstalling this app... As on cancellation they are charging full fees and app system is not appropriate. Zomato app can not confirm the order properly on one click they booked the order as i cancelled it in less than one minute.I am asking for refund but app's messaging system is also worst. Be careful while ordering on this app.,1
"There are multiple time it happens when i order i got improper food or not proper cooked food, complaining to zomato, no support just replying this wont happen again, i switched to swiggy atleast they work on your complaint. And give a proper feedback and solution, initially i was impressed by zomato but now our whole group are not ordering anything from zomato. You should come up with some good idea to resolve customer complaint.",1
"Offers are good but Choose swiggy, don't go for it. Worse experience many times and the orders get cancelled with no intimation. Always have to follow up on refunds(your money). The worst chat service and I bet you won't get response in time. Get frustrated easily if you chat.",1
Too good!!!😍😍 AWESOME foood!!!😘😘 Delivery on time!!!⏰⏰ I'm just Loving it!!!😍😍,5
Delivery is good,5
Worst experience with delivery and their customer care response. In app location finder presented wrong results to the delivery due to whatever technical glitch that needed to be resolved by zomato. But instead the delivery person used foul language and customer care response was negative. Quiet dissappointed. Should actually provide customer service rather than just advertising.,1
"This application works in a proper way. if your order does not accept by a restaurant , it automatically makes call and gets your order placed. Everyday getting 40℅ on maximum food, excites me and increases my starvation. well done!",5
They didn't deliver food nor refund my money ...its repeated twice....its very bad experience..,1
amazing taste and quality,5
This app just never refund the money even if there is a mistake from the restaurant's side. Today i ordered 2 items one of which the restaurant was not having so the valet told me about that. i reported this in the chat support and they didnt reply !! it has also happened to me before 2 times !,1
There is no call from delivery boy as per my call log and they cancelled the order indicating that they are unable to reach me. The order was of 310 INR.The address is specified clearly and this is not the first time we are ordering on the same address. Now the order is undelivered and the refund is also not getting processed We generated the mail for the issue but it is unaddressed for the main concern. Ideally fund should be given back or process the order. Zomato should help to save ratings.,1
Really horrible experience. They just confirm your order with even talking to the restaurant and you will end up with the Zomato customer support asking you to cancel the order! They can spoil your whole plan. I just don't recommend it to anyone. I would prefer any other platform over Zomato.,1
This didn't deserve even a single star. I ordered using ZOMATO but my order has been delivered to someone else. I have reached them through email and automated chat but didn't received any refund or assurance about my refund yet. This is how poorly ZOMATO treats it's customers. I will quit using this food delivery app if they don't resolve my problem.,1
Zomato gold member here theyNeed to upgrade open/closed restaurant in real time. I placed my order and after 1 hour delivery boys said restaurant is closed. Placed order again from a different restaurant its also closed. So why do you even show it in the menu as open and that too zomato gold restaurant . I wanted to eat food at 7 pm and its 10 pm now with no food in sight. Learn a thing or two from swiggy in this department. One thing that zomato lacks is picture in picture mode.,3
Pretty damn great. Hard to top. Just let go of the monopoly on menus for mobile browsers. Like some people who have had the app on a previous phone switch over and simply look for a restaurant menu on a browser are not shown the whole menus. So there's no choice but to get the app.,4
Now a days they are assigning multiple deliveries to valet at same time. Valet picks up your food but have other orders too for delivery and keep delivering them. Meanwhile your food gets cold and delayed. After complaining to zomato they only says it will not happen again but it happens again an again. Not customer freindly,1
What we are getting is expensive then the live counter and still you are adding delivery charges In every order If you are giving delivery service then you have only right on delivery charges Stick to your delivery charges And don't add your menu rates Add the live rates as we are getting on the counter Your all coupon are flop They don't even satisfy me a little You people are sucking money on the name of digitalization Money suckers and Blood suckers That's why your logo is red,1
"The app does everything it says. It has lots of categories, options and customizations. But the interface can get really confusing. I find it difficult to order food. Maybe its time to change the UI zomato!",4
Horrible delivery service! Waited for 2 hours for order to be delivered. No response from customer service or the restaurant. They couldn't track the order and no help in canceling the order. First times experience ordering from Zomato and it was horrible!!!,1
"It is the worst delivery app ever I have used. The delivery boy's don't have manner's to speak with the customer. They call and ask doubts always, even for simpler and common addresses even if we have typed the address in my account. I would recommend everyone to not to use this app.👎🏻👎🏼👎🏽👎🏾👎🏿. I have been using Swiggy from past six months and I would recommend that ""Swiggy""is a far more better app than this zomato. ""Swiggy"" gives us so much of discount on our order's.",1
"don't trust zomato, they are very cheap fellows they used to serve damaged food and send less quantity by maintain their discounts..for delivery also they takes min 1 hour time for near by restaurants only and moreover times are missing in cart I don't know why they behave like this and play games with customers health and time. I think it's an end to their business",1
"Zomato hires either zombies or blind people as delivery persons. They don't have simple common sense to check the address, landmarks provided by the users. They just go to location blindly using Google maps. If Google maps show a wrong place or wrong city they go to that place blindly and ask user to come there. Most useless, rude, rediculous behaviour of delivery persons in zomato. Idiots at least change now. Users give landmarks to help to find the correct address and reach correctly.",1
"Provides accurate information, which is always helpful. I enjoy the convenience of online ordering, with payment checkout integration made easy. Plus, online table bookings at restaurants. Gold membership is great too! Just need to figure out the locations and type of order, you can benefit at max from.",5
zomato is excellent in item order and delivered. packaging most importaint and when we r order and we r pay amont any balance amount transfer credit same with a order account to credit card debit card or bank. ur zomato credit and condition apply to tommorrow use this credit.so our anything amount credit in zomato pls do not apply a condition one month after I will use this amount. pls remove this condition... and hotels pls recognise hotel and halal in non veg hotels we want.in all through bang,3
Please don't use prepaid service on Zomato. I paid for my order from paytm but didn't received the order and no refund. Zomato Rider and Zomato executive said rider vehicle had some technical issue so he can't deliver but his live location was changing on a particular route. he consumed the meal and marked it delivered.Zomato doesn't have any customers support for these cheater too.,1
Very good service,4
This app is wow very nice faster delivery I am very happpyyyyyy hurrayyy 😎😎😎😎🥳🥳🥳🥳😋😋😋,5
"Initially the best app for food delivery. After using it so often, I'm so disappointed. Neither the order is being confirmed, nor the zomato customer service people reply to our issues but we have been charged online.",1
"Worst food ordering app. Twice ordered ,food was not delivered amount refunded. Reason they give is customer number was not reachable. Infact restaurant ask us not to order through this app as delivery boys reach late and do not deliver in time due to which Custer give negative reviews to restaurant. I will never recommend anyone for tomato. They have not refunded my money yet and multiple emails conversation going on which reflects clearly they will not accept their mistake. Go for food panda and swiggy. They are better in this case.",1
Delivery boy's are waste,1
"This use to be a good app but it is getting really bad, they believe that only their restaurant is right and customer is a liar, it is the 4th time my issue was left unsolved, it's time to switch to other apps.",1
App costs are ways higher than actual price. For all the delivery fee they charge food is never on time.customer chat experience is something they take to the next level of disappointment as chat executives don't even care about the services options for the chats try to close the chat without helping.,1
Good delivery boy service,5
Zomato is a very useful and reliable app. I use it to search and book restaurants. It is also useful in finding out the rating and standard of the restaurant. I use this app to order food quite often. There are many offers too.,4
"Have had multiple instances now of parts of my order missing from the delivered package. What is worse is the lack of empathy from customer support agents, despite providing proofs. They won't initiate refunds despite missing bits or even try to get them redelivered. Enough of this now. I really don't go around giving 1 stars to apps, I have given enough second chances to you Zomato, but you have pushed me enough now.",1
"I'm happy to have this kind of service support for food lovers, but you have to concentrate on Madurai location more to shine. most of the hostel is not listed and some regular buying hostel is not list after some purchase it's not good, zomato team have to be keen on Madurai location to fulfill customer needs.",4
"Very bad service, it will take more than 1.30hr to deliver the order and when ask customer care they also don't have any update on the order. Finally when you tell them to cancel the order customer care executive says it will cost me a penalty.",1
"If items are missing from your order, you don't get a refund. It just takes you a bot chat which replies that is is unfortunate and the restaurant will be notified. What about the money paid?",1
"Actually there is a new bug in that app ,due to which it automatically places an order before you can apply the coupon, also i canceled the order within a minute even before the chef could actually even start preparing the food but they just do not care, they refused to proceed my refund, they have become thugs trying to loot you. Very very disappointed",1
"Zomato is a superb Food Delivery partner. But i would like to see a Cancel Button. If I order something by mistake then i need to chat with Support team and They take enough time to reply and in that time the restaurant Accepts order and then we cannot cancel as It would penalise us with Cancellation Charge. Developers, please provide a Cancel Button so that I can change my Review. 😠😠",1
overall experience good. trustworthy.. but there should have some validation before placing the order like the mobile number because it is very important.. and there is some transparency issue. as if we update in my profile it doesn't reflect when u r ordering.,5
Food is so much costly,1
first of all no customer service number and they don't seem to have a courtesy to solve the problem we face....long wait for refunds and that to they only have chat bots ...no one real to solve real problems....i waited too long....for the refund and still did not get any....,1
I am not able to order my food.. cause it's not showing my location or even tracking it.. what the heck.!!! if we are not able to order food then why do they hv this app for.. i m really upset..i was expecting so much and that's why I downloaded it and this is what I get... plss fix it as soon as possible.. and let me know as I have not uninstalled it yet as I am expecting for you people to fix this.. so that I ll be able to order my favs and make my tummy happy 😋.,1
I bear witness that zomato is the most worst app ever ... I had ordered food and I was waiting fr a long time on the road to pick up the order. but the delivery boy did not attend the call and he came on the road and behaved cheaply...And then by the next order they said that no cash on delivery...And even I tried talking with customer care they did not respond...😡,1
I have ordered food on 11th April. But it was cancelled by me because wrong order was placed. But the amount is not refunded to me till now. I have sent a mail to the help and support department but they are not even replying.,1
Nice food enjoying....,4
What i observed is that..in this app if we order normally with out coupon the food we get is good....but with coupon oh...god cant explain...the food quality. . is jus disgusting...worst quality...the stored food is delivered....if dis is the case why the hell u give coupons...to clear all the waste food from restaurants???....why the hell u give offers?? Dont you care about people's helath to promote to app..disgusting app.i suggest people to not to tempt to these blody coupons and order food.,1
"I am a Zomato gold user and I thought that this is a good app but their customer query handling is one of the worst I have ever seen, I had mailed them, given them feedback on app and even via social media but not even a single reply was given for my query. You cannot grow like this Zomato, your downfall is inevitable",1
Hello! So my friend have booked for 2days i.e 2nd and 3rd ofMarch.She booked them seperately. somehow there was an error while booking for 2nd march. she bought 2tickets. The amount of ₹400 has been deducted from her bank account but she didn't get confirmation from Zomato nor did I receive the ticket for 2ndmarch. Hoping she is helped out soon. Thanking you already:),1
"The worst food app ever! I ordered food it was so bad had to mail, there was no response and then I took it to chat ,he said refund is initiated and nothing happened after that. No refund And now Agent is telling me to mail again. Same cycle everytime! Bad service",1
The worst app design and the worst chat support ever. Tried ordering a year later and the support is still pathetic. Nobody is able to resolve any issues. Half of the times orders get cancelled after getting accepted and they tell you that 30-40 minute after placing the order. Pathetic company values. I hope Swiggy buys this useless company.,1
They lure you by showing discounts and then at the time of ordering refuse to give that discount. Don't know how such a huge business can be so trivial. A total waste of time. Hope something better comes up to take their place. They don't deserve such a market share.,1
"Very disappointed.. My order shows it's delivered but strangely i haven't received it..i called your delivery boy more than 30 times, he didn't pick.. your customer support is absolutely rubbish..They reply after 10-20 minutes and seems not bothered about our problems.. Manage your support properly.. Frustrated",1
I had reported zomato that I am not able to order even a ice cream...but..the problem is solved♥♥...but....the address asked by dominos pizza needs to be below 50 characters...I tried to reduce it as low as possible..I reduced it to 41...still it says must be below 50 characters. ..annoyed by that¿¿...plz respond to me and fix the problem,3
I loved zomato delivery commitments and i also want to apologise to keep waiting the delivery man for 15 min in rain . One suggestion to zomato that pls add reminder option to app such that we get alert when order is reached at home (in case when call is not reachable or address is in doubt),5
Worst experience. Just needed to talk to customer service guy and didn't get any response for 10 mins. After sometime got the reply and closed the chat without understanding the issue. I am a gold member and this how u guys handle us. Not happy at all.,1
The quality of restaurants and food chains on Zomato is not satisfactory. The food provided by most of the restaurants is not good also the charges are very expensive as compared to the quality of food delivered . Please it will be convenient for us if you check the reviews and ratings of the restaurants and then make it available on Zomato.,3
Pathetic experience Zomanto never care about their customers they are only focusing to earn money and it's totally disappointing very very much frustrated with the food quality. They should upload pic of restaurants and address were some one is ordering foo. Customer have right to know the place where Food order is coming. Zomanto needs to start working on basics,1
"Nice app. Very lucrative offers and promos in delicious menus across all the restaurants nearby. Prompt delivery with courtesy. really enjoyed the foods with this decent and discounted price. keep alive this ""no cooking"" months. thank you.",5
This app is amazing. The best part which I pretty much liked is that you don't have to rate the person who is bringing your order unlike 'Swiggy'. The problem isin't about rating the person but sometimes it really irritates.,5
chat support is worst.....i ordered shammi kebab which is a vegetarian dish.......but i got some non vegetarian dish delivered......i send the photo of the item on chat.......the chat support agent argues that it looks similar to what he can see on google.......i order the dish regularly from the same restaurant.....but still he argued n did not provide me with any resolution......its 4th time i faced a similar situation......i guess zomato doesn't care about customers hard earned money,1
"Keeps you waiting ..... And cancels your order , does contact you with WhatsApp but its not zomato , and when you not receive the whatapp call which is an unknown number , then your order is cancelled , and then there is not cash at delivery , as if it my mistake .... And there is no compensation too nor fast delivery promise or any kind ....... This is worst app for other delivery apps",1
"Nice, tracking order needs to be little more efficient and app takes comparively higher time to open,especially being a food delivery app, you should give your page ready in a click even at a slower Internet connection, like it overall.",4
Very good service 👌,4
0% customer satisfaction fraud application for online food delivery never ever try this application ...worse of all ...uber eats and swiggy are much much better then this I placed an order by mistake and then I request to cancel the order from there side...just within few seconds after placing order...nd then they cancled my order but didn't made any refund for the same...and now they just stopped my chatting option...never use this application for food ordering,1
"Very bad experience from last time. I ordered from zomato and the after 90 minutes the zomato vallet informs that the restaurant has some issue and can't complete the order. After multiple confirmations the vallet suggested me to cancel the order and he will take care of the refund. But after the cancellation, noone from zomato helping to refund the amount explaining their policies. No uniformity of the information different execitves provide. Really bad experience.",1
"Very bad app, there is always technical fault your money will be deducted but your order also be not confirmed.. You will never get refund money.. So always prefer to use cash on delivery while using this. Try to avoid the use of this app..",1
Worst service ever... aleays debits money immediately but shops will not accept order... and then a valet will be assigned and he will cancel it and say I've reassigned it but it will never get reassigned... this happened to me more than twice... since my money was debited i had to wait for 2 hours to receive my order... what the hell guys??,1
"There was Technical Glitch like one Order is Automatically Placed, I've Cancelled the Order with in 1Min, But If i Placed any Order they Saying that i have to pay the full amount of the Previous Cancelled Order.. i Requested Customers Care... But No Proper Solution Came.. They Made me UnInstall this app... Don't Link any Cards or ID with. Do CashOnDelivery on Every Order.. Otherwise you will Lose your Money...",1
Very worst service. I had cancelled the order of food within 5 minutes of order.. I had mail about the issue but they dont care about it..they dont even have customer care number to explain the issue face to face.. I suggest all my contect list my relatives to dont download this app and unistall if thay have.,1
"super fast delivery !! they will vharge u 100% amount even if u cancel the order in just 3 minutes. they say food was ready in 3minutes and if the order had not been cancelled, in the 4th minute order wud have been delivered. super fast delivery !!",1
There is difference between quantity didpatched if order is placed through zomato. While good quantity is being served by the restaurant if order placed directly. No observation of zomato on quality as well as quantity only marketing funda. Friends think what benefit zomato get???? If they dont play any foul game.,1
Absolute pathetic service for food delivery . restaurant accepts the order and they call you after 1 hour to tell you that the restaurant does not have your product and customer service tells me they can't cancel your order becuase of their new policies and wastage of food . I end up waiting for 90 mins for two items,1
my friend and I have ordered the same meal with same quantity from the same restaurant. even the delivery boy is the same. still I was charged a delivery charge while he was not. I am yet to get a reply on what parameter did this happen. moreover I am not getting the option of writing my concern in the zomato chat.,2
"A frustrating experience. i ordered some food and the restaurant took ages to accept it. i requested Zomato on chat to cancel the order as it had already been 1 hour and the restaurant had not accepted the order. i later came to know that the order was delivered (apparently) to someone. i have been asking for refund on chat but it's absolutely futile. Their chat support is agonizing. @Zomato, resolve my issue. i want the refund.",1
The new interface is very bad. 'About the place' is to be searched for long to realise it was in the beginning only. Everything other than the place we are searching is highlighted.. request you to change it back to previous interface..,1
"Application is good but Zomato service quality has declined...Food spillage, missing items, late delivery is now common plus there delivery boys standard has gone down drastically...They even don't take action against delivery boys, if u do complaint... they got virtual artificial intelligence as there customer care...",3
it is far by the best food app i have ever used!!!! but i will suggest to make the delievery a little faster as uaually the food gets little cold by the time it reaches ! still i am rating it 5 as delievery charges are actually very reasonable,5
"Horrible experience. The customer care service is extremely rude. After canceling the order also, i have been charged for the food. The delivery guy doesn't show up if the order is placed during night giving vague excuse and the customer service deduct your money because their delivery guy failed to show up.",1
"Great app, Great service. Though restaurants play tricky with the app orders, as they do not provide the quality as they provide when we personally visit them. But it is not zomato fault, Zomato has eased the life with delivering food anywhere you want. Thanks. Be a little strict with the restaurant owners.",5
This app has become worst day by day they give offers and deliver worst food so indirecty you pay less for nothing and no refund customer service always respond after 30 min and sometimes 1 hr also and if wrong food is delivered your money is gone they are just becoming worst and customer sevice is also the app does not work at all sometimes,1
cancellation policy needs to be improved I request for cancellation immediately after placing the order the representative took 3-5 min to respond them refused cancellation the app nedd an improvement these should be a validation asking customer to be sure before confirming the order . I clicked on confirm expecting it will take me to payment page but the order get confirmed with case on delivery .,1
Its very nice app. Additionally giving 50% off to any order for new users as well as lightening fast delivery. I am very satisfied with the service. You can even chat with the delivery boy online while tracking your order at the same time.,5
Service is very nice and all the offers and discounts they are providing is good too,4
"Pathetic service. I have been charged an unnecessary fine for the order I'd already paid. And when asked, the management had no answer. Really pissed and disappointed. Would highly recommend you all to try Swiggy, UberEats etc but not this for sure. Bad service.",1
This has been the most regretful experience of all the apps ever used. They do not mention the exact location of the ordering place. Riders are extremely rude. They miscommunicate with the customers. The app is a fraud and tends to lure its customer for a satisfying food experience and then do not have a channelised delivery system to provide the food in time. Extremely poor operational efficiency. They don't deserve this star also.,1
"please do not install this app and order your food using this app...they have got the worst customer service...they screw up orders more frequently than delivering proper orders....most of the time the order is either incorrect or incomplete and they don't compensate for the same....they do not have a number for customer care to call, like fools they expect you to remain calm and patient while an incompetent person supports you on a chat... without providing a resolution the person will go away",1
"Hi, please know that zomato gives wrong prompt while cancelling order. they charge penality without even informing the customers in the chat prompt. these zomato people are stealing in the name of wrong cancellation propmt. CAREFUL PEOPLE. They will deliver the food very late and want customer to pay full money. but it doesn't apply same when CUSTOMERS cancel the order in a matter of seconds on app. WORST PART. THE APP REALLY SUCKS AND THERE IS NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT.",1
"I am a zomato pro user.Worst app after taking over other competitors, it has become worst! Its charges are unusual. The original price in the restaurant menu vs on this app differs very much even after applying discounts and zomato pro orders. Ex.if a dish price is 320 in the restaurant menu and you order on zomato its price will be 390 and after discount and zomato pro benifit of 25% extra discount you have to pay 350. Means ever after pro membership we have to pay more then usual amount.",2
"Evolution of this is app is remarkable. One of the best UI out there. Been a user for over 4 years now, other than a few glitchy moments zomato has never disappointed. Forget all other food ordering / dining apps this is the one.",4
"When i applied the promo code before adding my number it shows one amount, and when i see after adding number, the amount has become more. that too the delivery charge went from 45 to 85 for the same place. I think ubereats and swiggy are better options.",1
"Extremely disappointed with zomato. I have ordered number of times, few times they cancel just before arrival time and have lots of issues in application too. App itself pick wrong location and if you try to cancel before order confirmation then they imply wrong charges plus useless complaint team",1
"Worst app.. I'm very disappointed with this app. No proper response from customer service. Late delivery at night time. In app Est delivery time will be 25-30 mints, but in real it will take 1 hr to 1'30 hr. Hell with this app. Please update your services.",1
"The software which zomato using is the worst one..if even though applying the coupon it simply takes order with full amount and getting placed..after chatting with zomato people they are extending the chat ,they are simply saying after order placed, we can't do anything and order is placed food is prepared even though u cancel u have to pay full amount for cancellation as charges... be careful ...",1
"Used to be good app, now it appears the app is getting tailored to favour paying restaurants. You can search a restaurant review based on high stars but if you want to check the negative reviews a restaurant has got there is no filter option.",1
"Zomato has always been my go to app for the best restaurants in the city. I have tried the table booking option and it works fine. With the food delivery option, they have just got better.",5
"My updated review There service has gone from bad to horrible. Just in Last 4 orders. one order delayed by an hour (from a restaurant 2 km from my place) why? driver claimed he was given delivery at other end of city Two orders cancelled after they confirmed"" your order had been accepted by the restaurant"" and i went hungry tonight.. Because by this time all practical restaurant are closed I started supporting them after food religion saga, Despite their driver food stealing video. My bad.",1
I cant even open the app everytime i tried to open it It crashes I tried re downloading the app 4 times and it still didnt work ill try downloading again in a week if its still not fixed ill probably never use this app,1
"every time i order food from zomato it never gets on time and also they cancel the order at last moment , really u can't cancel order because restaurant start preparing but they can cancel after 40 minutes of wait.. and in chat option they won't let you in ... really upsetting it's not first time , it has happen multiple times and now back to back .... Swiggy is far better with customer service",1
Bloody cheats.. never make an online payment..these cheats will never deliver the order..always opt for cash on delivery,3
"Nice UI, easy to order. Rs. 100 off on every order made it even better. Live tracking of food works well and I liked the option to tip the delivery person online. Nice app, recommend it.",5
"App interface is nice, easy to use. one can get preferred food options at top. In terms of delivery, charges are higher sometimes. This makes the user to switch to another app for food search.",5
"I ordered 21 food thali from bikanerwala dated on 11december, 2020 but its was delayed and delivered after 3hours with stale conditions. Zomato guy said that we have requested to our superior executive for full refund of my amount and amount is 7500 approximate but still waiting . I highly not recommended to Zomato for a big order. Zomoto are not capable for big food orders...",1
"I know it's not entirely possible, but keep an updated check on which restaurants offer delivery till a certain period of time. Other than that, the app experience is great. Thanks.",4
Worst policy for refund. Genuine customers do not get refunds. Fake promises made for refunds On time or free is just a myth I got my food 10 mins late. Customer care says that company policy states 20 mins delay is refundable. So u need to satisfy urself with just an apology from the customer care on behalf of zomato. Highly disappointed by the company process. I would suggest always go for Cash payments and if the order is late do not pay the cash itself. Let the customer care come to you.,1
"If you have an hour long or more even when showing 15 mins to wait for delivery you can go with Zomato. If you do complaint about the delay, without any consent they will cancel your order. Such a rude management without a courtesy to the customers. Atleast they should know you are doing business with food supply. When you play around with the stupid sop of company, you are making people starve.",1
Very fast delivery good service very well done work of zomato.,5
"I'm not happy with ZOMATO response, I had completed many times about missing items, quality, quantity but still waiting for there reply....very late reply and they will respond to customers complaints after 48hrs that too 48 business hours....so better don't order and wait for few days to there response......",1
Pathetic team... I cancelled my order and my complete order amount was charged as cancellation fee which I didn't even know while I was cancelling it. I just got a message when I cancelled it. This is cheating with the customer. A pop up should have been there if there was any cancellation charge,1
Cheap third class service. Placed my first order and waited around 30 minutes and the order got cancelled mentioning due to heavy rush unable to deliever. What the hell is this if you are unable to deliever then why are you showing in the app. Could have given zero rating it is possible. Pathetic service.,1
Like this app a lot....but would like to point out one thing about delivery boys...they lack location awareness....if this can be looked it would be great otherwise they are risking their lives for us which must be appreciated...and overall I like the service of Zomato,5
I am ordering food for a long time. And I felt that this is not as our traditional way. The food is good or bad you have to accept this.. no option .we have to chat and wait 2 or 3 or more hours and getting no solution,1
Worst app ever .I had ordered my food at 6.28pm .the amount also got debited from my account. Now its 7.15pm now and i dont even know the status of my order .the app is not working its hanged .not able to find customer support helpline number as well.,1
They are not delevering as per the order given to them and after wrong delivery they are just returning the amount as a promo code for their app. Worst app ever..I will ask all of my friends to give review worst then ever. I m not going to use that ever,1
"Don't order anyone totally discussing app.In my location so many restaurants are showing, but if I order the food delivery boy will tell that food is unable to deliver it, you just cancel it, then why they are taking the order in my location.And one more thing some of the delivery boys are too harsh I recommend that don't order any one 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡",1
"For a small town like where I am, the services are too good. The foods are always delivered on time and the delivery guys are well mannered too. It's a perfect go to of any foodie, new or old alike.",4
"Totally disappointed: 1. The delivery guy was not ready to come to my doorstep for delivery. I did not mind at first. But then when I saw the delivery guy, I realise that the actual delivery guy did not turn up. Rather he sent someone for the delivery. The guy shown in the app was totally different from the one who came up for delivery. 2. I had to throw away the food because the food package was torn. Also the delivery guy was without glove and mask(i don't consider scarf as mask). Thanks",2
It was good indeed... But if the offer and discounts would hv continued for regular customers... It would b great... The service was quite good but the food wasn't warm.. If u can improve in those facilities then it is really going to b a flawless one... 👍,3
"I am not using this app at all, it's better to use any other food app than this. The problem is the delivery fee, it's too too much, where does the delivery fee will be 80 or 90. I don't understand why it's charging that much delivery fee.",2
Nowadays delivery charge is very high... it's too much,1
"I've been ordering food from this app almost everyday and one of the worst things that happened was Yesterday the food delivery person Was Drunk and he came and started yelling at me like ""why did you make me travel this long distance?""Inspite of me trying to make him understand that the app said that that particular restaurant delivers food to our location. What if I am not home and my wife ordered something and this delivery person behaved wrong with her?! Safety: 0 stars! C.Service:0 stars!",1
Very Disappointed...as the food was not even warm....,1
"I placed and order received but it was not good I opted customer support, but it is Worst customer support services. They didn't reply once in an half an hour. They our concerned team get back to you. But they didn't get back any team. I didn't get any justification from their end",1
I am really disappointed with its service. I ordered for half plae chicken tandoori. But the bill came for full plate. At last I thaught ok i will take the full plate but when I opened the package it was half plate inside. I am really pissed off right now. I think zomato has to do some thing so that these kind of situations never repeats. I think this is going to be my last order from zomato. Really disappointed.,2
"App is only good enough to browse through restaurant. NEVER order through this app, I got cheated with my online payment and they neither delivered order nor refunded money. They are fraud app but we can use app only for hotel information. Customer service is myth, they have pathetic customer service... Very disappointed.",1
"The customer care is pathetic.Chat service is useless..they make you wait forever.Restaurant numbers are never working and orders are seldom delivered in time.Also the site charges you more on many items,so make sure you know the original prices before ordering.No number to call to complain and they never address your concerns.",1
"overall the app is good, but it's not having an option for the non-veg people to find there dishes. there should be a filter option for non-veg people as similar as pure-veg option. It takes more time for the non veg customers to scroll through all the veg and non veg dishes to find their favorite one. if there is a pure non veg option, it could help us a lot. Thanks",3
Worse not reachable then you will charged. I have ordered from my another account and due to some technical issue delivery agent could not able to contact me. So after this he just cancelled my order and zomato keep the money Delivery agent just try to call.me once only.he did not try to ask security person to contact he jusg cancelled .ek to bhukh se maro dusra paisa bhi jaye.well done. Will uninstall this account as well. Improve your service. Maine to socha tha kuch aur bhi karu but let it be,1
I ordered the food but the delivery took a lot of time. After an hour i got the msg that my order have been cancelled due to no delivery boy available but when i called the delivery boy he said that he picked up the order but then it was cancelled..! I'm disappointed. I'll prefer swiggy instead of zomato,1
"It's easy to order , the delivery is pretty fast and there are a lot options to choose from too. A total life saver when you want something finger licking but are too lazy to cook anything. Love you Zomato",5
Such a Poor Customer Support Zomato is providing these days. Never expected from Zomato this type of support. Initially wait for 8 minutes to some one to attend the query. After 8 minutes the time extend to 20 minutes and no one is answering. Poor Service support.,1
"Service is nice. Platform can be a bit more convenient and user friendly. For instance, in the zomatoeazy section, there should be a tab to select only veg items.",5
"My experience with this app in minus because I changed my location from India to Dubai but when I downloaded the app after uninstalling the previous one, it's not taking the new one. Here people more depend on Zomato but I am not able to install with my current location. App should have option to change addresses.",1
"Worst experience ever !! The zomato executive doesn't even pick up when called, customer care needs a lot of time to process cancellation and refund, and on top of that if they pick up, they have excuses to why is your order not being delivered on time. Should've just ordered with swiggy, atleast they have a good customer care support !",1
"Zomato provides me list of restaurants as per my diet. I have recently diagnosed with imbalanced sugar level where I have to follow restricted diet. I'm happy to browse different options and experiments with my taste buds and not to follow mundane, boring foods. I wish to browse more and more diet options to keep both myself and pocket healthy.👍👍",5
"it is one of the worst service. they are cheating and looting people. I am uninstalling this app and I will never use this service again. No call center number to solve customer grivence. Provide chat support where bot talk with you. You have wait 10min to get reply from them and that also very pathetic. I have lost my Rs.414, and more than it disappointed with no body there to listen your grevience.",1
The worst food delivering app i found. The road side vendors are joinning the zomato food delivering app which means the road sided food are also been delivered to the customers of zomato for which the health issue of the customers are horrible. I personally suggesting that please before downloading the zomato app please go through this review. Everyone knows health is wealth. Why we should consume rotten foods wrong delivered food left over foods from zomato. This is completely wastage of money.,1
They don't solve customer's problem if delivered food is spoiled etc. They just send this feedback to respective restaurant & do nothing for customer. This is day-to-day business & there's no customer care number. This shows the level of service provided by Zomato. Use at your own risk.,1
inspite of the frequent update the app could be make more liter & friendly. More filter option inside menu list can be more helpful along with sort function. No service center number to help is the most good will damaging act that u r doing. Hope to see loads of improvement as u guys already are seeing the growth of this sector,2
Very poor service.They provide zero support in case of issues you face post delivery. On one hand they say they support no contact delivery and on other hand they deny support when contacted regarding missing items.My order had items missing and the support personnel denied any help stating that I should not have let the delivery agent buzz off without verification of all the items.,1
Zomato Customer Support in a pathetic condition.They don't respnd appropriately.It Charges very high cancellation fees on next Order. They're also not interested to put customer first. Every Application almost provide the facility to cancel the order but they charged a cancelled order amount as cancellation fees whether it may be of Rs 500 or Rs 1000. They also trying to make fool customers by putting Robots on customer support which does not customize the answers according to the issues raised.,1
"Thanks for providing open customers reviews system so that we can filter good quality hotel by checking it's rating/reviews. Now adding a new hotel in every location (including remote rural areas) should be made very easy just like we add new places on google map as a local guide. Most of place where I travel, zomato show ""Both hand raised i.e.we are not here"" So I think you should offer an option to add new hotel/restaurant in app itself, this will bring a pleasant revolution in village areas.",5
"Money deducted from my wallet. But , No order delivered. There is no way to contact / call for coustomer care. Only had the chat option. That didnot resolved my issue. Waited for an 90mins for order to get placed but after 15-16hrs my order gets cancel. No money refunded.",1
The order gets cancelled after 20 mins of waiting and the order updates are useless and pathetic..i called the restaurant and they say the order is dispatched but in the app it shows that the order is still being prepared.they charge the money for food right away but when the order is cancelled by the restaurant or zomato due to any issue..they will refund the money after 2-7 days of waiting.,1
"Zomato is the way to go, I had a grudge against them before, but they are really convenient. i have never had a problem with the delivery (except that it is late sometimes, but that's okay). Menu, reviews and pictures are easily accessible. A tip, even places with ratings 3.5 and so are worth visiting. I use Zomato for delivery, fine dining and gold privileges (with groups of friends). obviously helps when you're new to cities and done with street street foods.",5
it allows to find all sorts of food junction n options.. really nice.. there is scooe to improvise by giving good photographs of to be order food and also very important is to let the customer know the quantity.. a comparsion of bowl / dish size or dimensions of plates etc should be added,4
The best part of Zomato is it's quick service and various offers. Major disadvantage is we can never connect with customer care executive because they are always busy on another call. To cancel any order we have to ask for help but never receive an answer.,4
"I started using this app in 2017. At first it was an amazing app. At the end 2019 I ordered chicken lababdar and it was spoiling. I asked to give me my money back and they give. After a day the money was gone from the wallet. I ignored it. Then on 4th Feb I ordered black forest cake, My food was totally messed up and I complained about; however, NOTHING HAPPENED. I asked about it in Gmail and there as well NOTHING HAPPENED. NO ACTION WAS TAKEN. TOTALLY MESSED UP. I DELETED THE APP INSTANTLY.",1
This zomato people have charged me cancelation fees. Why on earth you buy are doing this. I have called your valet and spoke with him atleast 3 time. I have put proper address and you have canceled my order from your and. Your valet went to the wrong. Your app doesn't work proper. Where am I wrong. Your valet explained me the difference between coming on bicycle and motobikes. Why on earth he does that. Do I told him to come on bicycle or have you guys charged me less because he is on cycle.,1
Good service and huge cost savings also. Thanks to Zomato,5
"Everything is good except their policy towards people who feel sick after eating food. I request zomato to consider my appeal to make a policy on this issue. When someone ordered food and fell sick immediately after consuming food, then zomato should reach out to the customer by calling or sending nearby delivery executive. They may charge for additional costs they incurred but they will be able to save lives by reaching out to customers on difficult times.",5
"I hate to write bad reviews for any app. I didn't get what I order, they even don't reply, and either the delivery guy stole my food or the restaurant didn't give my food. Neither got refund. Another time got dead insect in my food, I am vegetarian by birth. Don't know whom to blame. Another time, ordered extra bread, didn't get. Use swiggy or uber eats. Zomato you are a sucker.",1
"Off late this app has been throwing far too many errors. Eg takes forever to load a change of address then errors out,l. Keep getting unexpected errors when ordering, trying to find location etc even when there is excellent WiFi or strong data signal",3
"Very poor service, no proper customer support , the food i orderd from fishland restaurant in Ameerpet was rotten , instead of apologising and refunding, they are much concerned about their support changes to email chat support. non of the fellows ever replied me nor gave a refund. N even they r not giving any complaint number. This is not only the issue I faced, they are Many, other food delivery apps are superb in there services and customer support.",1
Order hasn't reached after 1.5 hours. Wrong delivery person shown on the app. No support executive assigned for half an hour. Ridiculously poor service. Not the first time this has happened either. Definitely not going to use this app for ordering again,1
Usefull app only till you don't have to deal with customer support. Terrible customer support on chat. They will try to drag out issues as long as they can with no resolution in the end.,1
"First of all, Uber eats was so much better that zomato. It says that login with OTP and when I enter the otp, It says invalid OTP. When I say to resend it, The app hangs. Third class app. I bet the the quality of food would also be Third class.",1
It was good at start but once i ordered and did not received it. When i asked for refund they said they cant cancel the order and when i asked for order they didnt repkied anuthing on that. It was already 90minutes since i ordered but there was no sign of my order.,1
1. Some instances of how zomato cheats/is a wastage of money. • Prices shown are higher than the actual restaurant price list. • Zomato might charge you >delivery (whearas restaurant could deliver free for that certain sum) >packing charges (”) >taxes (over the mrp of restaurant) 2. App has a bug. Most of the time the list pf restaurants will be empty or shows not accepting orders. Have to try restarting app and randomly it works. This can happen in b/w order completion also.,1
"One of the issues is that if you place an order and try canceling it within a minute, there's still no refund. I wonder how in one minute my order is completely prepared so as to cost all that amount.",3
Very bad customer support. No response when we raise any query. I ordered the food and it was not delivered to me but the app showed that the food was delivered. I tried to call the customer support but no response.,2
"I have very bad experience from this app. I ordered food from the app . i entered my complete home address , including my home number and i locate near to my home in map. But after that they cancelled my food of the reason of my mobile number is unreachable but my home address which i provided for the delivery of the food that is fixed in the city.The food delivery boy didn't come to my house, and they cancelled my order. I chat to support regard this issue , i am very disappointed.😨😨",1
"Worst experience ! They don't mention that your discount is available only on prepaid order .i order my food on cod and apply a promocode they giving me discount but after some time they remove their promocode and i paid double money instead of discount. Swiggy is much better than this,easy to use and easy to understand.",5
Most of the times order accuracy is screwed up and what do they is give that money back as zomato credits which is paying again to get food because you can't use zomato credits within 24 hours because it won't be credited because if technical issue. Ridiculous !!!,1
Waste of time.... Very bad...,1
"Bad service, never the issues are resolved . Some of the restaurant listed looks posh but are way below average (hygiene) . When complained about an order they ask us to put review on restaurant page but they won't take any action.",1
Zomato - Restaurant Finder and Food Delivery App is a very good and great app for a foodie person who wants his food to be delivered on time. This App's delivery and quality is very good and the food gets delivered on time. The delivery boys are very good and the food delivered comes in a great packaging. This app gives me many great offers and discounts to order food and it has more than 90 Restaurants available on the App. You can use this app whenever you want to order food from a restaurant.,5
Worst customer service. For an online app they have very very poor support system.. I wasted 4 hours trying to get in touch with their support team They have no customer service number. Basically the app has all your card details and no face to it.,1
"re-review on 1st April 19 zomato is really unfunctional . I believe, besides being useless they are liars as well. I had such a bad experience yet again when I recently placed my order and the food was bad. the cc was pathetic and lied that they contacted restraunt but no one's answering whereas when I called the restraunt , it was nice enough to change my order. more so, the costumer care executive was so damn rude. this is the worst app guys and not at all trustworthy. So for Swiggy ! anyday",1
"Chor sale. Looting us by their unathical services. if you'll place the order with online payment.you can loose your money.. i ordered the same and due to some unknown reason my call was on unreachable. so they didnt reach at delivery point and give my meal free to their delivery boy. when i call him, he told me because you were unreachable so i finished it. After some time when i order with cash on delievry and just truned my cell switched off, the delivery guy reach at destination without call",1
Zomato's online delivery is just horrible. Once after ordering food if somehow your order is not delegated to the restaurant there's no way you could contact zomato customer service or even cancel the order. You should just sit tight and wait for hours cursing your fate. Zomato's online chat is as pathetic as its online food delivery. If you are lucky on that day your food might get delivered else only God knows how to contact either of the zomato customer service or restaurant.,1
Very good service,4
"Worst customer service assistant. If you ordered anything in this platform is utterwaste of time and money.. Most of the restaurants listing high price in app and providing discount while ordering. Suppose If you think to buy a burger, from one restaurant, the original selling price may be ₹50, but in the app it shows 80₹ and then provide 10% discount. Restaurant charges and delivery charges extra. If you try to complaining about any thing you don't get proper solution",1
Very bad experience with zomato both in delivery and customer service. I regularly order late at night and the service is honestly disappointing. Giving credits means nothing to a hungry customer who found out that the delivery got cancelled after waiting for half an hour.,1
"App is just Ok. Have used it for food order few times in emergencies. But, had bad experiences for 2-3 times. Worst service and customer support. Customers have to pay for the mistakes of all others. They don't address any sort of issue from their end.",1
Terrible service! The delivery boys apparently drank my beverage on the way and the chat support doesn't believe what you have to say. After waiting for 2.5 hours we received half the order and the half of it was also wrong. Too disappointed and tired right now. But will write a bigger and detailed review soon!,1
"The app keeps on crashing whenever I clicked on delivery support, as my last delivery was incompletely delivered and there no other way to contact the customer support. The mails sent to customer support also goes unanswered . Worst experience.",1
Most irresponsible app. They dont have a customer care no. to call. My food was already dispatched from the restaurant but on the app it shows food is being prepared. Their rider is not available on the call for more than an hour. The zomato app keeps chatting but doesn't call for taking our complaint. This is very frustrating.,1
No cancellation options...once order gets placed. if cancelled then customer need to pay full amount of the item. this is redicules i have called to Rider as well as Hotel Staff but they simply said you need to cancel by Zomato App. And the point is that there is no cancellation. Great..,1
zero star is not available or else I would have given them zero star.. I ordered from a restaurant wer zomato people have not updated the restaurant menu and after paying for the order in online the delivery guy is saying we forgot to update the menu the item u asked is not here its been 3 weeks I have still not received my refund ..worst app if u rely on zomato u vl end up starving,1
"Not satisfied 😡😑 I saw the ad on tv that it delivers on time or free but is it really??? Don't think sooo.... I ordered food and it's arrival was very late 😣😬 i talked to delivery boy about the ad but nothing was said by him.. except "" maam its an ad not reality"" Was disappointed ☹️",1
very poor service. poorly managed. dissapointed. and faced losses. My suggestion is never make payment before taking delivery as you may loose money. Always take cash on delivery option is you have no other option than to order food from zomato,1
Provides wayy better service than any other food delivery platform The gold feature is amazing Professional and personalised working system Instant curation of problems,5
"pathetic experience....order placed at 11:13 which was accepted by restaurant....but no valet assigned and its already 00:23...no reply from zomato customer care since 29 mins though the average wait time is showing 1 minute...i have contacted to restaurant they are saying that other orders placed through zomato has been picking up by zomato valets....my order is kept prapared at restaurant but not picked by zomato valets though,valets are operating actively its my order only which is being delay",1
One of the horrible bookings done by these guys. My delivery was partial incomplete. Spoilt lunch plans. even the refund I had to download the app.the system shows either the phone number is not updated or my email is not updated always have any issue better keep away from this guys,1
"Worst Experience with this app. It is not showing information of restaurants properly. Sometimes it shows Closed for ordering , few moments later it doesnt. And It shows 'Cant deliver to this address' , when delivery is 50feet away!",1
Had high hopes.... But then it just crashed any hope that we had.... Not reliable at all...... Not gonna used ever.... Also the customer service is so rude,1
worst experience with this app. I am a gold member still I ordered from this restaurant food lover and waited for 3 long hours with order not delivered. then the restaurant just marked it delivered with delivery guy switching off his phone. no one from zomato helpline came to assist. even worst i won 29 credits while predicting IPL match which were also not credited. other food apps are much much better.,1
"the services provided by the app are okay. however, the app blatantly disregards user preferences. despite having turned off notifications in the app, i receive promotional notifications on a daily basis. i do not appreciate overly forceful advertising, and therefore do not recommend this app. have uninstalled.",1
The experience of ordering food is great. But Zomato should have a comment section for the food what we order. Sometimes the food is great. But sometimes one can't even have a bite. So you must provide a comment section for the food.,4
I cancelled my order as soon as I placed since the delivery location is wrong. The payment is not refunded and I have cancelled before the restaurant confirmation. Really worst and please go for swiggy and uber eats. Thery are best in this market with less delivery charge and hassle free experince.,1
Very good app and all employ and staff very good nature and fast delivery app,5
You need to find a way to avoid delays. And then stop charging the customer for such late cancelation. Someone needs to be more customer centric at Zomato. Innovation can help you find a win win solution for all. Problem is in your mindset.,1
Too bad that Zomato doesn't have an option to add on items to the menu. The customer care is absolutely useless in this respect. Swiggy has way better options to incorporate such issues. The offers and coupons are just not enough.,2
"Trust me this app can hit you hard at any hour of the clock.I have the WORST experience using this app,not once but twice. A person order food when he is hungry,and what these people do is they will accept your order amd will not deliver you for an hour or two,and after they will cancel it.For the first time i let that go,but not this time.One of my friend has even a worst experience,as he ordered the food ,he payed it online and later he found that the food was deliverd to someone else,not him.",1
"Have some issues with my delivery locations, the home address does not get picked up. Otherwise app is well-developed and features are pretty complete. Perhaps, given that online food delivery is common in almost every household these days, only GPS tagged locations, other than address for delivery would be better in future.",4
"Gourmet passport is better than Zomato gold as there are no fake exclusion days like pre diwali and diwali (6th and 7th).Funny thing is whereas Zomato reflects exclusion day,outlets gladly accept gourmet passport.Also ,no way to convey same to Zomato as getting through KBC helpline is easier than getting your call answered by zomato's customer care",1
Best app to order a food. Whenever I ordered from zomato they always provide offers also payment offers taken into account sometimes. The order may be cheaper than the indoor food you make. Still need some improvements but now compared with other food app zomato is the bigg boss.,4
"Good service my delivery person,",5
"This app is losing its credibility due to idiotic promotion of 45 minutes or free scheme as remaining orders are deliberately being delivered after maximum possible delay. Management should think again that if new customers base will not be dealt appropriately, they have always other options, Good luck",1
I m really frustrated of this app features. I cancelled an order for 2 times for the reason of taking my old address automatically even I changed to new address. This happened for the first time and asked to cancel my order. After repeating the same order vth new address but again took the old address automatically and cancelled the order for same reason. I won't suggest this app for the reason of this worst feature,5
"Since you've acquired uber eats, here is an advice. Live up to their standards. Stop selling food on higher price than the actual restaurant. Uber eats always gave us good discounts and was overall a very good food delivery app. You started out good but you went downhill pretty fast. You were selling food for 40-50 rupees higher than the actual price i mean what were you thinking. Please leave up to the standard that uber eats set",2
"Terrible, so when items are missing and you report it. The reply is thanks for the feedback we will make sure it won't happen again. The only thing that isn't happening again is me ordering food from zomato.",1
"Worst experience... Got delivered food at 11 mid night.. Already was so 😡 angry as the order happened by mistake... Any order before placing will ask- these are the items u r ordering this much will be the amount and this will be the mode of payment, can we confirm the order? But this super app without any kind of confirmation will place the order even if we press by mistake.. I wanted to go back and mistakenly chose the option. Please update your app to confirm before ordering...",1
A bad experience and disappointing customer service. Missed my lunch break several times because of their delayed deliveries and the support service attitude was unacceptable. And you dont even get to rate the conversation to give her/him a 1 star ( the one star for saying sorry not for being of any help ),1
"Really Pathetic Service....never order from Zamato....they charge more than double of the real price....some orders really dont get delivered to you and according to app it get delivered....there is no customer care number and no way for consumer support....this company is making fool of us.....they are totally money maker....this is not service delivering app this is money making app for this fraud company......please do not waste your money, be aware from these fraud companies",1
Its to good app and vry honestly speaking its vry hlp to conversion and at all,5
"So much frustrated with the application, If the order cannot be accepted, then why do you go to payment gateway and make payment. Now I have to wait and watch till your refund is made. Highly Disappointed.",1
"really bad experience, i was charged even when it said payment failed. The delivery went throught and i didnt get any cashback. i left the office knowing that the order was cancelled but it came and they refused to give it at the office without me there.",1
While it serves u goodfood..i gave it 2 stars because i feel that they should not cancel one's COD option for ordering food just because they cancelled their order..i know the wastage of food is much bigger problem but they should be given 2 warnings instead ..since one may place an order mistakenly. Hope zomato will look forward to bring some changes to this ..🙂,2
Please make an option where the customer can leave his or her feedback about particular restaurant and cuisine or food. Which will be helpful for other customer to check those comments or feedback and visit that place. I think this option with zomato is available in Gulf countries. I would be happy and appreciate for the same if we have the same option here in India. One star less for this reason. Otherwise u guys are doing fantastic job.,4
"Application is good. But deliver valet are even worst. Zomato is an interface where in it delivers the food at doorstep, so it should take premium on its core job. People will order food from where they like and will rate the food quality under food review. But if Zomato fails to deliver its core job to customer satisfaction, I am sorry but we have other application with better promises running in business",1
Seriously its a pathetic service!! Only the delivery service is good!! Chat cust ser is quite good... But the partner restaurants they have poor!! And sometimes they have major system gliches!! Huge inconvenience and few rude cust ser agents as well... There are very few instances and restaurants am happy with.. rest is pathetic!!! Don't use,1
Very good service,5
Great app. easy to excess with great deals displayed above. Its my suggestion to work on app in such a manner that the food ordering must be more easy for all customers think about uber eats & some how work closly on that parameters...so that more customer will get it,5
Smoothie came without seal and driver drank it and gave me only half the bottle... I'd called the restaurant and confirmed if they will normally give half the bottle and they have confirmed that they will give it full. This is happening again and again all over the place... No proper action. Final good bye to zomato. Next time I will getup walk and go eat. It's my mistake that I ordered.,1
I have placed an order through the mobile app. After completing the payment the app shows the order is not completed. But the amount got deducted from my bank account. Tried to chat with the chat support option but its not working.,1
Great for people who don't wish 2 step outside house. Great service also saves lot of time,1
I like your fastest delivery,4
"The worst application, I would not recommend it. A lot of delay and issues due to this application and the argument is always ""The restaurant"". In addition to the rudeness of customer service.",1
Ordered food at 8pm and still at 09:25 pm it shows food is preparing. Worst things is that person who is assigned to pick order don't know anything about this order and the worst support don't have any number to call just chat with useless bots. Bad experience because of no customer support.,1
"I want the invoice, but I am unable to get it to my mail, no information regarding this.",1
Poor location tracker. Every time i have to Go and collect order far away from my home. Delivery boys are not cooperative. They stick on location address even if you provide them your full address at time of order.,1
"This app is very good and made my life very easy, whenever I feel tired I just order the food. And also I save lot of money. But i have one issue that you stop my cash on delivery payment.",5
This app sucks. Right after I bought gold they stopped delivering to my location after 8pm. I contacted the customer support and they were useless all they did was asked me to write them a mail and when I did they didn't bother to revert back. Worst customer support and the app is useless,1
Was never fond of online services but this time its different. Tried for the first time. When you are all alone far from home Zomato can save you from starving. And food provided by the vendor was appreciable. Thanks,5
zomato is always my first preference whether it's about ordering online food or going out for dine in. if food is not up to the mark they always give instant refund. such an useful app. easy to use. you can check menu of any restaurant before going der. love zomato. xoxo :),5
"Zomato has changed some rules, their delivery boys will stand at a spot for minutes, but won't look around for the delivery location, then go away and I am punished for not collecting food, icing on the cake? they send an email confirming delivery, ask for rating and when I called back the valet, he has travelled 25 mins of distance in less than 5 mins!!! I end up paying a punitive charge for his lack of intent of delivering the package.",1
"there is no customer support either via app or via call....they didn't deliver food stating that phone was not reachable which was not true,nd address was already given.....after that no assistance thru chat or call....worst service ever.....swiggy and other apps are much better....wish i cud give them zero star.",1
"Zomato doesn't care about the customer satisfaction at all while delivery option. In need of food, order thru another apps as zomato won't deliver on time and on top of that they will never resolve the problem but they start giving u free food or refund of money after delivering worst or un-eatable food. Then u hv to repeat the process of ordering the eatable food from same restaurant but with apps like swiggy or uber. Will recommend folks around me to not to go with zomato ever.. .",1
"A very good app ... In Patna , maximum restaurant deliver on this app and the timings are also good....food is trustworthy and there is no leakage as in other apps. If u are seeing the ratings for downloading ....download this app ... don't do attention on hate ratings ...they r completely fake",5
Now a days delivery charge is too much. But not for all....i can't understand why this happen to me.... Literary delivery charge is too much. Its like 60/70 rupees delivery charge. Thats why i uninstalled it. And this problem happen to me after new update.,1
"Worst experience ever. I placed the order when the app showd d hotel Suvai Aruvi was about to close in 15 long mins @ 0945PM. But hotel dint accept my order. Immediately after few mins i called them to chk y dey dint accept it, dey hang up on me twice. Zomoto valet cudnt locate d hotel as dey were nt responding him too. Finally he found that it was already closd. I was damn hungry n dey made me wait for 40 long mins and told hotel closed. They spoiled my dinner n its d 4th time it happened to me.",1
No response to queries. I had been charged for a meal that I didn't receive and Zomato reports it as delivered. The app conveniently does not have the option for the customer to confirm the receipt of the meal. Zomato has neither returned my money nor have they given any reason for not doing so. There is no customer care call number too.,1
"Have ordered at around 12:45 Am and at last i came to know that the ordered has been delivered, tried calling the delivery guy several times but his phone was switched off, thn I tried to contact the customer care they said they cant do anything, u can place a new order and have added rs 50 as an apology ....seriously zomato u think after waiting for 1 hr u want us to order again and again wait for 1 more hr then again the same mistake would happen from ur side..... Great support from the team",1
Very good service,3
"The delivery is most of times way too late. Also, the response of the delivery man was misguiding about the order. Inefficient and incorrect order taking system. Might not ever use zomato again. Very disappointing experience since past three months.",1
IT is a worst application i have ever used. the food quality delivered is very disappointing and the agents also do not accept order easily. they make you fool by sending wrong locations and service is very bad. They use to give you wrong information too. The quantity is very less as usual .,1
Very good service,5
"If you click ""order now"" by mistake they will rush to bring the order and there is no proper option to cancel immediately. chat is pathetic. They will punish you by deducting cancelled order amount from future orders. Horrible experience!",1
"zomato is charging 100% as a cancellation charges which is very rude , even if there is cancellation within 5 min after order. please reduce the cancellation charges, i uninstalled the zomato app because of this higher cancellation charges. Except the cancellation charges every service is good, their offers are good, sometimes delivery takes too long need to improve in this, sometime we are confused with what we ordered please also provide pictures of items.",1
Not good biryani bagaledhu asalu konchame vachindhi adhi kuda,1
"Poor customer support. Majority of the listed restaurants are not good. Delivery service area coverage is very restricted. Present offers of sun50 & new50 are just fake to trick customers. Today this app was showing ""presently we are not accepting orders"" message continuously.",1
very good experience with this app. it take some time to get used to this app compared to ubereats. pricing is as much as original restaurant offeres but you get discount offers(zomato promo codes) throughout the year. delivery is quite fast. more restaurant availability compared to ubereats.,4
"Swiggy is more better than the zomato. Mainly the issue is, I ordered food in zomato from my work location. Immediately in a sec i got to know that i ordered from different location and restaurant in a minute of time i contact help line. There was simply saying sorry unable cancel and refund.",1
"Recieved wrong orders twice! Tried calling the delivery valet after recieving , number dialed shows to be either out of coverage or no one seems to be available after a while .This is more hurt ful when valet says he'll call back on reaching the restaurant.but never turns up. Wasting money twice is really disheartening.",1
"This app is great, user friendly and very helpful in finding the best restaurant at a given place. And for budding food bloggers like me this is a platform to connect with others and showcase talent.",5
"Once you hire the Kaamraj back, obviously ur Customers and the ratings will get increase, or else there are other services too, who are fulfill the delivery needs to us, please don't make us take that dicission, or u gonna regret that...",1
"keep it up, delivery charges is more",5
Please do not be fooled by the ads. Pleas do not download the app. It is a fraud app.let me share my experiences with you. I had once ordered food for 420rs. It was cancelled after an hour saying the restaurant has closed. Then i received a refund of just 90rs. Once i ordered for 620rs and i received my order. It was prepaid but the order later showed not paid and i was left with a deficit payment of 620rs in Zomato after. Please please please don't be fooled by the ads. It is a fraud app.,1
Number of things 1. Delivery Service has became pathetic since the time they have acquired uber eats. Delivery boys have to deliver multiple orders at the same time which has increased the delivery time. 2. No use of giving discounts coz you end up adding rs 30/40 tax and plus delivery charges which makes ur discounts null n void 3. Customer services doesnt seems customer eccentric.,2
"poor customer care support, they ask you to wait 10 mins and dont show up for half an hour, and if they reply and you dnt reply back within a minute they close the ticket, really ridiculous and the restaurants on their panel in Lucknow are all fraudsters, you order something they'd send something cheaper and absolutely tasteless.",1
Worst app this don't have a pay on delivery option and if anything goes wrong with the order their executives are making the customer wait on live chat for 1 minute for each reply and by the end they are just giving excuses but not solving any issues. Just go with swiggy or Uber eats they have at least good customer service,1
Deducts the money 1st and then gives confirmation of order and if the order is cancelled then you have to wait for 7 business days to get the refund. I placed 2 consecutive orders and both were cancelled after deduction of amounts. So basically you have to wait for 7 days to get the money back and rendering you unable to use that money for any better use (other that Zomato ofcourse).,1
"1 star for for forcing people to download the app to check a menu when it was available all the time previously on their website. Forcing people to download an app is a no brainier 1 star, i would post a negative 5 stars if it is a thing. Forcing a 1 time use only app is not cool, that's called bloatware. I'd like to see a change then I'll be changing my review, till next change. :)",1
Too many screw ups on the app. My food got 3 valets assigned and ultimately tge order got cancelled after 1.5 hours if waiting. The situation was made worse by the fact that i had relatives over and everyone was starving. Been a loyal customer for years now this kind of service is not at all appreciated.,1
Its a nice app...but it will be great if we can order not from single restaurant but from different restaurant also,3
"From last two orders, cooking and packing is taking time from the selected counters side... Also, I faced issues with payment while my last order, money got deducted twice for the same order, whereas as per the zomato app- first payment attempt shows as payment failed.",3
"Orders are not delivered, yet the status shown on the app is delivered, useless customer service, been in contact with them for the last 10 days, still haven't got a refund for an order that was never delivered.",1
this app is utterly shittyy. i ll tell you why. 1. Delivers faulty orders 2. Rude customer service 3. Don't change or pay back for the faulty orders recieved. 4. most of the times customer service doesn't respond saying they are busy. 5. ask the customer to contact the restaurant directly when actually thats the only job they do. 6 . switching to swiggy will help you eat in peace. edit. : 7. customer services refuses to accept the fault even after seeing photos of food.,5
"When u can't deliver food in time, or can't deliver at all, don't run the app anymore, waste of time...hunger is not easy to control bro...taste and quality ofcourse sucks, but the basic is, if you can't even make satisfy the hunger, there is no use of running this app.",1
I choose the do not ring bell option . But i live in an apartment so the bell on my phone rang when delivery guy reached the gate itself. And the delivery guy came up and rang my callimg bell. The whole purpose was lost. Also i dint get any response in the call option. Other than this the app is fine 👍,4
Worst app... I had few missing items in my deliveried orders and when I rasied a request to zomato support.. They gave me an option to cteit the money to my bank or as a zomato points.. I choose zomayo points and it turns out that I can apply them as a promo and not as zomato credits.. This inturn is alwoing me to choose either zomato offer or the zomato credits I received which is uselss now,1
Half the time it shows that the restaurant is not taking any orders even when they are. I just refresh the app a couple of times in a span of one minute and everything gets back to normal. Kindly look into this.,3
"The app is okey does the job, but the payment gateway have serious problems, till now i have faced 3 payment gateway failure out of 10 transaction but the money gets deducted from account, also refund process is very sloe, please fix your payment gateway.",2
"Attractive offers, and usually reliable delivery. They do mess up once in a while, like miss parts of the order, but you're reimbursed promptly. Overall really good service.",4
you people are simply expensive.. swiggy and ubereats are competitively cheaper and better offer.. your delivery 20 plus the size of this muffin what I order it is unexpected. just that I didn't had cash wanted to use phone pe I used your app. and this is the second time I was fooled. even after complaining last. I didn't get any reimbursement from you all. neither any better service.. simply expensive. I would really share my number incidence on social media..,1
Very good service,5
"Received wrong order...it can happen but, as a resolution refund is promised and in actual it is not done. Happened 2nd time that refund is promised against wrong order delivery and still 1st refund promise is pending since more than a month... It seems Zomato is neither working to improve their vendor nor their own process of customer complaint handling. Amount doesn't matter but it reflects how healthy system zomato is managing...",1
I ordered a diwali gift for a friend from Anand Sweets through Zomato. Three expensive items were replaced with a single cheaper item. The only way to complain is through chat and they stop responding after saying the restaurant is not taking calls. Shameful cheaters.,1
"I used zomato to place the order for dominos pizzas, it was my first order on zomato. Somehow Dominos declined to deliever my order and said that they will cancel the order but still in zomato app it was telling me your order is in process. When i spoke about refund policy to zomato like how the money will be refunded. Will i get the money credited to my zomato account or to my bank account but customer care representative was reluctant to answer any query. They saying we are the mediator but dude I am using zomato as platform so you must take initiative to protect your customer. Worst experience with ZOMATO. Your attitude will sink you ZOMATO",1
"They'll delay your orders, then cancel them and then give you credits as a goodwill gesture. But before you become happy my friend you'll be blocked from ordering for ""Suspicious activity"". The help desk will tell you they are ""helpless"". Meanwhile you figure how can ordering food raise suspicion. Con-artistry at its best.",1
"Very nice app for ordering food anytime. Also support team is good. in case of any issues, you get the amount refunded directly to your account. overall good experience.",5
Absolutely disappointing.. still waiting for my order for 1 hr 40 minutes.. the customer service has absolutely no control.. totally disappointing.. Facing similarnissuea for the last few orders and Zomato has no intention of sorting it out.. Total.disappointment .. Talabat and Uber eats is much much better.. Such a Shame..,1
very bad experience recently. twice my order was not accepted and money is not refunded for both the orders. it was showing as confirmation is pending with restaurant bt when i called restaurant they told that they have not received the order..not even showing in their orders to accept.. support service is pathetic n useless,1
Zomato has always helped me in locating new joints and even getting reviews on the established ones prior to ordering or visiting. The best part is anywhere you go zomato assists you with your food cravings. It's an app that I personally like and recommend. Kudos to Zomato for its great work👍👍,5
Had a good experience on the first delivery but right to the second i can't use the ZOMATONEW promo code which was applicable for first five orders. Didn't like this. Fix this please or I won't give this app any more space in my phone.,2
I had placed an order at 11:45 PM. The hotel had accepted the order then I received a call after 15 minutes rhat they could not deliver the order and I was told to reach Zomato customer care to get my money. Zomato customer care took 30 minutes and disconnected the chat 2 times when they called to restaurants but the restaurant did not attend their call. Zomato is creating problems while returning customer money. Order No. 12***39691,1
"worst service. I ordered food from the Zomato and 1 hr passed I didn't receive my order while on the app it showing food is delivered. and on app they didn't provide any customer care number where I can call abd raise the issue, they just provide chat support, which is useless support.",1
"Worst service!!! There customer representatives are only feeded with ""Appologies for inconvenience we'll surly provide best service in future"" rather than solution to customers issues. Its better to choose COD than paying advance because if they get money in advance they won't care about the delivery (feedback is on the basis of my own experience not once, but multiple times with Zomato) Customer satisfaction should be the top priority for any business to grow but I don't see that postulate in Zomato's policy. Edit:: Even after so many bad reviews. I don't think so that Zomato is still taking pain to understand their customers issue. The auto reply to negative feedback will not get you your customers back you actually have to reach them to solve their issues. HOPE YOU GUYS UNDERSTOOD!!!",1
This is the worst app. I always face problem in my orders. They want us to pay for the mistakes done by their executives and deleivery person. Not worth of ordering. I am not gonna order againwith zomato. Their is no person to contacat with if you have problem. Even they want us to pay for their mistakes and dont even reply for the mails. Worst services.,1
Superb App! The entire zomato team need to be appreciated for constant developments and improvements. I have been using Zomato since quite a while now and finding application has been made more user friendly and customised. All the best and keep up the good work!,5
Zomato used to provide fast confirmation and delivery of orders. It doesn't show realistic time for expected delivery or preparation anymore. I preferred Zomato earlier because food arrived on time. Now 22 minutes turn to 1 hour and over. Really disappointing.,2
Late delivery everytime,1
This Is The Worst App For Online Order....Bhaii Last Order Mai Money Paid Krne Ke Baad Bhi Order Received Nhi Huaa Aur Restaurant Call Tk Rcve Nhi Kr Rhi H Restaurant Was Pocket Meal@99 Naa To Delivery Boy Rcve Kr Rha Naahi Restaurant Waale If Any Proof Require I Have Every Period Of My Payments Nd All Plsss Before Ordering Think What I Had Gone Through,1
"Very bad... Items are not delivered often at doorsteps, delivered at different locations/wrong addresses, post payment many items are not available and you need to follow up for refund, many times refund also is not processed. In short, use it only when there is no option",1
very poor service. I forgot to apply promocode at the time of booking. Within minutes I had requested to add but they denied. Poor customer service. Bigbasket gives excellent customer service.,1
"It is a very good delivery system, sometimes i face issue, sometime they won't get resolved, make sure to assist the customer to the fullest and take control of all the food outlets mentioned on your app (eg Domino's)",5
"Shame on You ZOMATO!! Ordered from here and the seal on my order was off. The food was stale and looked like a week old. When asked for help, their executives clearly denied to help and said contact the restaurant directly. They just disconnect your chat when they don't have any answer. This has happened to me on multiple occasions. No assistance have been provided to me yet. Still have the screenshots of the chats.",1
"My experience is really bad ,firstly address is correct but delivery boy refused to deliver the order ,then order is rejected by zomato and then they refuse to refund the money even if i have said that 'plz cut ur delivery charges and refund my money' plus there is no facility of call and user is not not able to write his own message without there option. I will never use this app again",1
Very good service 👍,5
"cant even describe, the location marker never works, even when my house location marker is correctly placed.. the delivery is done on the wrong location , while at the customer care, the message is not sent even when its been typed and sent it isnt shown and dont care",1
"I use the app for last few days and order my meals through it. I love the app because its very easy to use. Not only this, the customer service they provide is really appreciable.",5
Very poor experience They first accepted the order .then after sometime a message sent to me is that your order is delivered without delivering my order and when i try to contact zomato they responded like they are doing charity to me by refunding my amount after 4-5 days. Worst app for small town.so i suggested to avoid zomato in small town specially,1
good app for food. discount also good. but sometime it is failed in real time update. i got message from pizza hut that order dispatched and zomato also confirmed that it is picked via message. but in software still preparing. this happened a lot,3
"Worst service ever. Didnot receive food even after advance payment. Delivery boy cancelled the order showing cause of non response. Surprising I didnot receive any call from zomto. Word of advice, If you are planning to use Zomato, be careful as they dont even refund your money even if the delivery not happened. Worthless customer service with inefficient personnel. Totally disappointed.",1
"Order was supposed to be delivered in 30 mins, even after 1 hour, no update and can't even cancel the order. Cancelling takes you to chat section which is absolutely useless, waiting time to chat always remains 1 minute, even after waiting for 10 mins :(. How can i get refund of order which never got delivered???",1
It is high time to uninstall this app as it is just a gimmick to fool customers. Not only the food is sub standard and ill prepared and packed poorly but also they do not pay any attention to issues with food and service. Swiggy is a way better app to satiate your hunger.,1
"I initially placed an order from the app and payed through Google pay, the 1st order didn't get confirmed but the amount got deducted and i was redirected to the zomato app from Google pay saying that the transaction had failed and that any amount deducted would be refunded in 5-7 days and there was a retry payment option.So I retried the payment again  This time the order got confirmed but even the first order which had failed got confirmed with it. The customer help just blamed it on me",1
Be aware of this app I booked two orders in gap of 12 minutes at same address one order got delivered other was rejected neither the food got delivered nor I got back my refund I waited for 2 hours When I contacted they gave me reply that they have disposed of my food and did charity by donating it Seen first time who did charity not with their money but with money of their customers In CAPITAL I ADVISE TO AVOID IT,1
Need lot of improvements in app. Many times you get debit in your account and then restaurants deny accepting orders. No where on the front page contact number is given to call restaurant. The refunds are not instant. Takes 7 days. Its cheating,2
I still haven't received an order of mine since more than 1.5 hours even though the restaurant is down the road. The restaurant hasn't been responsive and zomato customer service has been unresponsive since more than an hour too. Terrible.,1
"Most cunning app.. They are saying like order will be free if it extends the time.. But from past 5 minutes I am tracking my order, its still showing 12 minutes. Estimated delivery it showed is 34 minutes, its been 45 minutes now. Don't know the norms at all",1
This app was my favourite food delivery app from past 2 years but it's disgusting and terrible app. Zomato people you have degrade your services. You claim to order food on time but guess what you didn't get your food neither. Cash on delivery is never available. I paid through upi my order was confirmed but i didn't get my food. Your executive from north west delhi Neeraj never answered my call. Fake company you'll never be on top. I have mailed you so many times but no response from your side.,1
"Don't even think about downloading this application.. I used to be their regular customer but when I faced an issue with my order they straight away denied to help me saying that the order is delivered to you now we are not able to do anything about it... Guys, don't expect any kind of assistance or help if you face any issue with your order... Your money will be wasted.. Zomato is a fraud application.. They don't think about the customers at all once they get the money..",1
"I have been using zomato since last almost 1 year. since i live alone so buy food almost everyday from zomato. As far as restaurant is concern some are very good and some are just fine. Delivery is the key to success. However, customer handling is pathetic if you got any trouble then you are not going get any substantial or solution from customer service of zomato. many times i have ordered food and got something else which is way less the price i have paid. Customer orientation is missing.",1
the service is pathetic. I just ordered something and I had an issue with the same. But upon complaining about the same I didn't receive any response and I couldn't send the text through chat option. Not gonna recommend it to anyone.,1
very good app... I loved it...!! I would also recommend others to use it...for it has lot of discounts. zomato eazy has breakfast lunch and dinner for reasonable price without delivery fee and also zomato membership has a lot of offers....,4
very fast delivery service,5
"Absolute pathetic Customer service. I would give a zero star rating if I could. Valets don't know how to talk to people. A little deviation from the address and they won't deliver, not even give a refund. Shittiest app.",1
"the app consumer journey needs an update. as a first time user issues in finding the cart after changing screens. placement of payment types and storage of card info are some no go areas. happy to discuss over call, email the specifics with screenshots.",4
"Poor service. Delivery takes the order away with him and eat once u miss a call and don't even try to delver at doorstep. Also, they have listed many restraunts for which you cannot track the order. You won't even get the order after waiting for 2-3 hrs and chat service is too slow to help you out. God bless zomato. Never gonna use it again.",1
"the app is okay but it does not detect correct locations. the helpline is so so useless. its horrible. going to uninstall after this order because if i cancel it, there is a penalty fee equal to the bill cost. zomato sucks.",1
"Worst experience with zomato support team, they have made false promises on refund amount for the spoiled food. But it's been 6 days no refund received. Replying to the email created new ticket and did not get any reply from 2 days. I had never faced such a bad experience with swiggy.",1
It was taking too much time to reach the door,1
"Actually, it's great but sometimes I am frequently unable to open the app.its a great thing indeed that there is only very few times when the delivery boys are allowed to take leave .They work very hard in fierce time . Great job indeed ! Keep it up... you guys are doing well and great for us and our tummy",4
The most worst app ever... It just provides low quality food and there is no options to contact properly....just money waisting.... I ordered food from a shop which was of gud rating but they have provided me with low quality and cheap food....i didnt even get my money back.....Uber eats and swiggy is far far better than this ugly app.... Shame on your service....Customer cheating app....Bloody idiots...how could you do this to ur trusties..? I' not ready to give even 1star..yakk But to post.,1
Very very bad experience... No one is helpful... Shame on the customer support who are just looting the clients..and their assistance in matter is a big zero.. they provide me wrong transaction ID which was a successful in order and asked to demand the money from paytm... WARNING TO CLIENTS* If your money got stuck... No one will help you in any manner.. they just keep you roam around here and there.. But no proper solution to the problem.. At last you end up with dissapointment..,1
"The delivery of the food is most of the time late than the time specified, and the delivery person always asks the address 4 or 5 times even though it is clearly stated in the map it is annoying!!",3
I've order an item using a promo code to get 50% dicount as they are offering 50% off on first 5 orders. The promo code got applied and I went to add card details to pay the amount. When I check the bank account I got charged full amount and there is no support where I can talk or chat with them. Even if I initiate a chat no agent will be available to assist till hours.,1
"Worst App , after sending messages it isn't showing and worst customer service , Last night I order a veg pulao , and they send a bowl , and what I ate in restaurant is totally different and I received is totally different, for same food and price , in one day they started maintaining such differences, no reply and so service from them , wait till 2 hours you won't recieve any single reply",1
"You guys are freaking liars and cheaters. I didn't received what I ordered instead of that I received something else. When I contacted your customer support via chat, first 30 mins was transferred to 3 different persons and that too they were responding soo late, then I was chatting with a bot, then again when the agent is connected with me, he is also giving me same statements as bot, then what is the use of customer care. I would never ever order anything from here, didn't received compensatio",1
"today i placed one order with wrong address. i dont know how address was changed as i was present at my exact location. After that i chated with Zomato regarding change of address. I asked whether i should change address or should i cancel the order. They said that they will change the address. They gave this assurity three times but nobody came. Delivery boy was not picking up my call. Somehow when he picked my call, he said he will not come. Swiggy has simple rules than this.",1
The app is really usee friendly. The user interface and tracking system are top notch. The only problem is that some of the restaurants which are open are shown as closed sometimes which is a headache in itself. Otherwise it is one of the best foodie app available..,5
"Zomato Chat Support is dumb as ever. Chatbot is not at all intelligent to answer simple queries on order status and payment issues. Even after order showing order accepted it was not delivered. No option to select ""Not Delivered"" Worst Ever Experience with Zomato. Name should be changed to Lutoo....",1
good app it's much better than uber eats any complaints regarding food quality anything which you did not lit it... zomato customer care services are awesome.. fast response to complaints.. easy to use.. professional delivery man... I found it is good as compared to uber eats... it's was not cheaper than uber eats... but service are best and quality of food was awesome,5
Please not use zomato as they are not professional to handle customer queries.. Unnecessarily you would be charged and they would not hear you. Restaurant gets offline often and your chargeable amount would not be refunded if deduct. Worst customer service as there are no humans operate only auto chat transcription available. Uber Eats and Swiggy is far better than this. No value of time and money.,1
"Most disastrous app, no proper customer support and the app interface sucks and the counter parts swiggy and uber eats doing far far better! Don't waste your time ordering stuff on this app if you are hungry. Worst part is no customer support which gives you prompt response!",1
Disgusting. Absolutely mo way to escalate if your order is not delivered. no call center to call. online chat no one responds even after 10 minutes. Delivery not done. Delivery boy doea not deliver and order not cancelled. payment made in advance. no process to get refund.,1
This app has started to cheat people now. Making people wait for hour and than bringing stale food. Like Zomato dont have enough problem they are striving for more. Another technical issue they dont have voice support so if you are having a bad day then your finger will be aching while the representative will disconnect continuously.,1
"This is worst app to oder food, I mean seriously i am so pissed off because of this app, i ordered a pizza from ovenstory and i got a different pizza from the one which i ordered, it was so dry and it was a very old pizza made very earlier that day i presume. I took pictures and video of the pizza and tried to go for supoort, Zomato did nothing but to say sorry and assure me that it wont happen next time after a 35min conversation with a stupid chatbot and not even a customer care to call.",1
But cash on delivery is not available otherwise good app Please allow the cash on delivery because sometimes bank server was allow to pay the money so cash on delivery is best option 👍,5
Very good service,5
its good but not always. sometimes issue occur like not accepting order and suddenly accepting . a moment there is no outlet for delivery and suddenly all are avilable and sometimes not a single coupon is available but suddenly available .. managing the app is poor.otherwise good,4
Never buy Zomato Gold membership if u tend to order most of the time food for single person to eat as zomato doesn't offer any special discounts in that case. U won't feel as if u opted for best deal and saved some money. It is really waste of money. I have made one stupid decision of buying zomato gold membership and wasted money.,2
"this app is very helpful. I ordered a dish through cash on delivery which price is ₹94 and I have a ₹2000 note.so, i decided to connect with zomato chat and it was very helpful to use zomato chat they contact the rider who is delivering the food and said to bring the change for me.",5
"Your Service is terrible.not delivered as promised, food as been opened and if i try to text ur support the app crashed and now have to uninstall it from my phone. Made my phone extremely hot and un usable. Over all very disappointing. A year ago u r service was good but its now too terrible I won't recommend this app or this service to others",1
just irritating....i have ordered more than 40 mins ago but till now niether my food was prepared nor any zomato vallet was assigned and one more thing is my zpl prediction is also missing. And the best part is the chat service where you will be served after half an hour if you are very lucky...just irritating...i will suggest everyone not to use this bloody zomato....,1
Very good service,5
"Very bad experience when it comes to giving good customer service.....I had placed an order which supported 1+1 free and had ordered 3 pasteries but due to miscommunication between the delivery guy and the place wherein I had ordered, I didn't receive one of my pasteries......when I asked for refund, only part payment was done due to technical issues in the system.....The customer has to suffer losses due to mistakes committed from your end.",1
First I used only Zomato to order food online but their price is higher than Swiggy. So I just moved to Swiggy and now using it to order food. They do not have any plan like Swiggy Super so that we can save our money on delivery charges. Delivery charge is the main reason to switch over to Swiggy.,1
The app is not able to connect to the Internet even when all other apps are working. It only works if I uninstall and reinstall it. It works for the first time and again has similar problems if I reoopen the app again,1
"I ordered my food from this APP today..First they changed the valet member,then they cancelled the order due to technical reason after wasting my precious more than 1 hour.After that we prepared the food at our home.How easily the customer care said that your order was cancelled.I was left with no alternative.Is the app not answerable to me or its consumer?Who will help consumer from this?should I go to consumer for this?",1
"Very very worst app. I order my food Worth 200 . Due to the Corona viruses delivery person not available. My amount failed. They said Within 3 to 5 days amount refunded. Now more than 1 month still not get any amount. No customer care number, no way to reach zomato person by mail also. Cheating , fraud, person.",1
"Horrible experience, I waited for my order for 1 and half hour and they didn't even let me know that the restaurant cancel the order. It wasn't showing anything on the app is well. Horrible just horrible.",1
"Today I had placed order @ 8.40 p.m after getting late with acceptance from restaurant,I had asked for cancellations, but he said you will have to give penalty after cancellation. I have make a call to delivery agent @ 9.35 pm,he said still your food not started to prepare, I want to know that penalty option is for only customer?? and the aggressively way of assistance from Zomato was very painful. specially very disappointed from Zomato assistance service.",1
Very good service,5
Its very well organised app n easy to find restaurants. However many times some listings dont deliver n its not clear till we click on it. Please fix this. Also try n send change in case of cash delivery...it inconveiences the good natured delivery boys n i hate to see them Labour away unnecessarily. Cheers!,4
"My order wasn't delivered but app started showing it has been delivered. When contact on customer support, they said they can't get my order details because of technical errors. I didn't even get my refund.",1
"Am item was missing in my order. When reported, i was told that I'll get 170 rs coupon which won't be enough to order the same food item. Worst service provider ever. This isn't the first time I'm having trouble with them.",1
"Food recieved is incomplete order The restaurant is not sending the items mentioned in the menu and the bill ,it happened with me 2 times . I've ordered a thali and not recieved all the items mentioned in the description of the item . Zomato should look for it and ask this from the restaurant. We are paying fo the items and not recieving them . We are very dissapointed with this. Being such a reputed site zomato should look after this,but it is not happening. You should check the food sent us",1
"Chat support tech asked to raise a ticket with order@zomato for a particular issue. I never ever received reply(7days at this time) from order@zomato. Everytime I asked about this with chat support tech, they fool me by asking me wait 24 hrs and you will surely get a reply. Such a poor support experience.",1
Facing pathetic experience of late night orders. I placed an order at 11:50 pm which is having estimated delivery time of 38 minute but still at 12:33 am app showing food being prepared and balance estimated time for delivery as 32 minute. Avoid ordering food late night and prepay your food bill.,1
initially my experience with zomato was not good.. once the order was not delivered as my number was not contactable... and returned without my intimation... and i was not even refunded for the amount i paid.. second time half quantity was served and even after complint raised by me costomer care replied they can not help me on this... but now i am glad zomato has worked on their customer care and delivery.. zomato is prompt in the part of customer satisfaction...,4
"I have been using Zomato for 3 months now. The service that has been delivered till now as compared to Uber Eats and Swiggy, is way better. There is a wide variety of restaurants available. The delivery is preety quick.",5
The worst app ever. The unresponsiveness of the zomato with its customers is the worst thing. They donot delivery the food after taking the money neither they have a good customer grievance mechanism. Their support system is useless because they donot respond to their customers complaint.,1
Plz back the option cash on delivery,5
"I am giving Negative rating for this service. I had place the order on 13-07-19 unkniwingly extra iitem was added in thatorder. But I was request to modify the order. At that time food was not prepared. Executive was told me No option in zomato for modify you can raise request for cancel order but no money refund you will get. order was cancelled, food neither prepared by the restaurent nor deliver me. This is worst experience with executives no one resolve the issue.",1
"Nothing is Guarantee what you order from this site. They take no responsibility. And they speak for suppliers only. Even if they send you stale items they will ask you to take picture and send if you contact online chat, and once you send pic, they will say ""we have contacted the seller and they wont repeat it again"" if you ask for replacement for the stale item they will reply the pictures dont show it is stale"" the believe pictures talk to them. To put it simple order at your own risk.",1
"very bad customer support, post order delivery if we have problem with the order, there is no quick revert back, we have to wait for customer support email after 2 days, are you expecting us to store the food till u respond back?..many times the food gets tampered during transit, and that bill has to be bared by customers..",1
Bad service through zomato. Had no option to cancel order even if its emergency without cancelation fee. I had contacted support before the restaurant had accepted the order and support reverted back to me after the food preparation had started and claimed that now i have to bare the cancelation fee. Does it even make sense? I had to wait fo like 2 to 4 min even after an agent was assigned to my chat. Worst service. Swiggy.. Foodpanda... Provide us with better customer service.,1
"The tracking Can be improved. Sometimes the delivery boy will be waiting at the door but still the app shows he is still away. And Develop a easy eay to order, Its difficult for a not so knowing person to order on Zomato. its very complicated.",4
"Very chep customer support, I ordered food they mark the order as delivered without delivering it and when I try to escalate this with customer support they took almost an hour to get it resolved and what I got in the end is refunds, that mens my time, my hunger doesn't matter to them, over all very rude behavior I am uninstalling this app",1
"i ordered the food and made the onlinepayment, when the delivery boy reached he did'nt even bothered to call me.zomato showed the incorrect location,when i was tracking the location of my order it showed that it's on the way and after few seconds my order got rejected. Neither there was any call from them nor the zomato refunded my money, so please don't make online payment on zomato coz it might get rejected and they don't refund any money.useless application😑",1
Fast but taste not good,3
worst customer support.. i have suffer from their delivery service.. all time i get scattered food and packing and they didn't considered it.. when i was sent the images of food they said there is network issue sent again images.. what the hell they doing.. and the biggest problem is they don't have any customer helpline number... WORST WORST WORST APP...,1
"No respect for the timelines committed. Typically food gets delivered 20-30 minutes beyond the committed timelines. Additionally, if there's any concern to be raised you end up coming across a freaking chatbot who's algorithm got no clue what concern is being raised for",2
Very good service,5
"Sometimes the orders get cancelled without any notice and we don't find out untol we contact the support, if the riders are made to be in contact more with the customer, that'll make this app perfect. Otherwise everything is pretty good",4
"Day by day fallowing down due to poor Customer satisfaction. toomuch delay in responding time. they doesnt Need Customer satisfaction and issue resolutions. in recent times I think Zomato have lesser orders than Swiggy. Bug Swiggy performing well., Well short time to respond and taking care of customers by calling. And they give preference to customer satisfaction.",1
As discovery app i give 5 star.as delivery and customer service i gave 0/100 they make orders with resturant even they are not dealing with them they take the amount from my credit card they ask the resturant if they will accept the order or not its a big joooooke then they cancel the order andmake u wait a mercy to refund your amount..and no use of the fu***n chat helpless,1
I always order from Zomato as I had very bad experience of swiggy.today I had ordered from Zomato again and this was pizza hut order of farmers pick.it was showing that it will get delivered within 11 mins for 1 and half hour and the Zomato person cell was switched off. Zomato was not supporting on chat as well I was trying on that as well.i get pop up that after 2 hours food has been delivered which was not.i tried Zomato chat support calling pizza hut as well but none was answerable.,1
"They don't have a customer care support, They give surprises last moment to say that they can't deliver to your area, They have chat support but there is no option to type, You have to select from their given options, Even the taxes are more there's no point in giving promo codes ....",1
"worst service, don't order anything from Zomato, because Zomato is not verifying the restaurant and menu of the restaurant, to day i received Broken food packing, wrong drink and food quality is worst. this is not a first time for every two orders one order i will face same issue, i think its 5 times I faced issue. they will refund ur money but not into ur bank account, to Zomato credits with limited time to use. Again i am facing frm last 4 days on words",1
"Useless Waste of time and money. Zomato support does not work. Have to wait more than 30 min to get response from them. They don't even resolve your query. It's funny like they don't reply to your queries but use 1 abusive word, they reply instantly.",1
I am ordering food from Zomato since 2-3 years and there have been alot of time where i had to loose my money because Zomato doesn't take responsibility for the quality and the quantity of food the restaurant provides. And this is soo frustrating because they will replace the order only if the order is wrong or there is any package issue. Or else there is no hope for you to get your money back of the quantity is too low or the quality is not what you paid the money for. Customer satisfaction 0,1
"Before selecting any resturent please verify. Today we got very bad food with half of the quantity. Fried rice is half of the busket and in one it was quarter also. Chilly chicken should be 4 pieces, but it was 3 in each packet. It is really unfortunate. Next time I will give second thought before selecting Zomato. I am requesting you proper action and accordingly inform me. I am waiting for your response.",3
Very Very Very Very Very Very Very Very Very tasty,5
"Horrible , it said delivery time would be 20 mins and now i was kept waiting for more than an hour. And the first thing that the delivery guy said was ""please give a 5 star rating"". By that time i could have went and fetched the food myself,my first and last delivery thanks",1
"Very pathetic experience I order food..it take more than hour ..i call the restaurant ,they say the food has been delivered.But on the app it shows its still preparing .Then call the rider .he is not answering calls initially..and after some time ,the message on the call is that the phone is switched off.Tried conveying same to zomato people they were also unable to reach the rider Note:The payment was already done online As it was not accepting COD..plz be careful before paying online",1
Worst app I have ever used..I have booked an order at 8.07pm and it shows 28 minutes to deliver.after 28 minutes every time it is showing increasing delivery time...deliver boy contact number is switched off.after 7hrs of booking it is showing delivered and I m still waiting for food...500rs deducted from account.i will go to consumer court with all tha screenshots,1
I was ordered today on 17th october arround 8:50pm and my estimated delivery time was 9:41pm order till 11 PM not delivered there is no option to contact zomato customere care and on chat services there is computer based program if you are not satisfied chat will end also there was no callback program for the same . i want my money back by zomato,1
"Never order from zomato... Request to all... I ordered from domino's through zomato app the bill was like 530..which I already paid through card.. After waiting for 2 hour's. I got a msg that your food has been delivered. I was like is this some kind of joke, me and my family waited for the order which was never delivered.. Such a pathetic service for zamato and domino's..",1
Best App for food,5
This is worst app i ever tried. My payment done at 8:45 and Zomato showing order at 9:30. On support chat without solving query support member stop chat. Not able to upload screen shot in support chat which is very basic need. Not going to use anymore. Worst customer care and worst service,1
very useless service... no refund initated. help desk person responds after 5 days. what do u expect a person to wait for 3 hours before???? highly unacceptable again same issue has occurred with Zomato. no response from team 3 hours for ordering food from high speed delivery,1
"I had ordere ""mojo pizza"" on zomato. after 40 mins of wait, when i called the number that was provided (it got directed directly to mojo), i came to know that my order was cancelled. Zomato is still saying that my order is in kitchen. customer support chat is of no use as i did not get any replies to my many messages. it was a prepaid order. apart from keeping us hungry, THEY ALSO HAVE MY MONEY and it has NOT BEEN REFUNDED. Cheaters...",1
"It is a very good app and quiet helpful for searching alot of good restaurants, bars and pubs out there... And specially Gold feature is the best feature I came across specially for fine dining... In short it's a great app !!",5
this is the worst app customer service is very much poor they dont even respond to any concern they almost take an hour to listen they reply after evry 10min interval for every message my food didmt get deliver but refund is not credited still they are saying you will get it in 1to 2 days... by saying this they postponed a one and half month still no refund,1
Best app for fooding order,5
"nic app.... but ironically the customer support is worse ...their's no way u can contact the customer care...rather their is some sort of AI chat which god knows what it talks about.. i canceled an order...they cancelled it for sure...but my money...they fooled me for 4 5 day... after which i logged out of my accounts... if they are not short of customers, i too am not short of delivery apps",2
"Totally disgusting. I have ordered a cake and made online payment after some time I tried to reach them but the call got connected to the shop directly, then I have a sms that ur order got cancelled as we r unable to reach u. So I took chat support and there the executive was telling me that ur money won't get refund so I told him that I wanted to wid ur senior so he told our seniors doesn't take chats.I said r u serious u guys took payment of 536rs and seniors doesn't hv time to talk. Need help",1
"It's very good... If you know what to choose properly...depending upon ratings... GPS tracking can be better but that's not a problem...the only disappointing fact, sometimes though, is that the delivery boys are sometimes very rude in nature.",5
"Horrible to say the least. I placed an order, waited 30 mins, restaurant called and said cant deliver because of distance. My redressal was to go back to Zomato app and chat and tell them. I did, they were not willing to believe me. They called their partner who had a fake number registered so it did not go through. The guy or gal on Zomato chatted with 40 mins, debating about refund without one word of sorry. DO NOT FALL INTO THIS ONE, ITS NOT WORTH IT.",1
Swiggy is much better choice. Experienced trouble of time. Zomato doesn't follow a format and their executives are not punctual as like swiggy which leads to delay and wrong handling of orders. Hope you guys take things a bit seriously. I usually order from Swiggy and use Zomato only in worst cases.,2
"Everytime order given , one of the item misses , then same is refunded back , after several pictures of food are sent , this is not professional attitude, Zomato I am intrested in food not my money back , but I faced it several times , either whole order restaurent dosen't give or one of the items is not given, then comes lengthy process of pictures of food etc to get money back.",1
Hidden bugs in the app. Corner cases of app not verified before release. Get the source code tested/revisited again. How can placing an order online take you back to the order page back n forth? Isn't an error suppose to be thrown/shown if order cant be placed? Wasted my time trying on the app. Swiggy is far better!,1
"Excellent!!!This app did a great job,bring all the resturants and food centres in my house.Just order,wait and enjoy.And not to mention that the delivery time is less than I expected during my first order.Just simply awesome.",5
"Amount has been deducted on March 11th 2020 and still didn't refunded even after raising the ticket with proofs, it's been 10days. I didn't see such kind of worst response, other apps are better than this. I wil uninstall and will inform friends and family to uninstall. Will you refund it or need some more days or months??",1
The order I got was wrong. It was missing an item and i got no help at all from customer support. I even sent pictures of the wrong item and receipt. The chat agent was rude and i did not even get an apology. I was just told to make an email and they will get back to me in 48 hours. Wow. Just wow. I did not get what i paid for and got this service.,1
"Previous version of ZOMATO app was good. In the latest version, I am not able to see my past orders. This is really frustrating. I can't track what items I previously ordered. Please fix these issues.",2
nice dinner at the product is most likely misspelt the video in the product of two or three of us are me marriage pic for PIC microcontroller based upon the product is the product is most you can see the attachment of resume for your help and support my application for this domain is subject to change my mind and videos from and sold by Amazon digital and social development manager at your house or yours is send the email I will have the opportunity and videos from and videos from and videos,5
The app works good. It is very user friendly and the customer care service is also very efficient. But the tax and extra charges laid on every delivery sucks. But that isn't the problem of the app actually. They provide offers every now and then. I'll recommend Zomato as a good alternative to Swiggy because Zomato offers delivery to a wide area were no other food delivery app delivers. Good service. Keep up the standards in future too❤️,5
i have picked up the call and explained the full address. and the delivery boy was hardly 50m away.. then he again called me but of some reason i was unable to pick the phone. my order was rejected and also they are charging full amount penelty.. why you have the gps.. if the customer have to explain the address again and again.. i was regular user of zomato.. but now i will not use it further..,1
Pathetic customer service. Slow deliveries. I would recommend Swiggy over zomato anyday. The app did not pick up correct location & was off by 2 kms. They refused to deliver the order & did not even refund. It would have hardly taken 5 mins to deliver the order but they wasted time.,1
"Today I got to see very poor service from zomato, which was the reason that my order was delayed first, after that I got a call from zomato support and told that your driver's tire was punctured due to which your order was not given to you Will be able to get it. And you cancell your order. After that I canceled my order and gave me 7 days time for refund payment...",3
The worst food delivery app. I was missing some items and I called immediately but it took me multiple emails and couple of weeks to get proper reply. Ultimately they provided me some promo with an expiry date and not refund which they should have processed in the first place,1
Good App and options has been increased,5
"Worst service ever, couldn't cancel an order which is instantly available ... doesn't even take 30 min for delivery ,but 30 min after ordering the delivery guy telling it will take 45 min. I said cancel cant wait with hungry, they cant even do that worst experience ever..Swiggy or Uber eats for better",1
"Wonderful app, always shows you the right options to order your food. Very helpful customer service. They make sure the food reaches you on time once the order is placed",5
App is very nice . but we always have lot of problem with the food to reach at our place. The delivery boys call us 10 times but won't understand where they have to come.,4
Very bad experience. Recently I ordered two dishes from same restaurant. But I received only one dish with bill of two dishes.I asked from delivery boy then he replied I don't about kindly contact to restaurant or Zomato chat. I tried to restaurant but not able to connect then I have tried many times on Zomato chat but no response from Zomato chat also. I request to everyone that do not order on zomato.,1
I think of some feature I want and they have already implemented it. Providing everything that a person will require or want in a food app! The technical team behind the app should always remain progressive and add better things with time!,5
"I am unable to use Zomato App to buy food. After adding to cart payment not happening. I informed Zomato via email. Waiting I ordered Baskin Robins Ice Cream 450ml via Zomato. I got just 255ml including box weight. I weighed over my electrical weighing scale because it was light weight. I complained to Zomato Team, but the Support Executive did not help. I decided to file consumer case informed the same to Zomato Team. The executive disconnected the Chat. I again did chat with another Executive.",2
"Super easy to order, discount on your meal. Lightening sharp customer support and wonderful food delivery persons! I guess that sums up Zomato. Aah, lest I forget, Zomato gold offers: dine out and get 2+2 on drinks. Does one need anything more. Try Zomato friends. You will love it. It is better than all the swag and swigs :-) All I want is more pics for my food to drool over before I order!!",5
"The order was placed by mistake in me in the application, yet people took full charge on canceling from me, it is wrong.",1
"Needs lot of improvement! The way you promote with some of exciting offers, have concern to prompt the same while payments.. for instance, i have a promo code for one of your exciting offer and till the payment was made it did not prompt to apply my code... this is worst, the app really needs improvement.",1
"This app is telling me to choose your address with current location and when I clicked it, it first gave me a location which is far away from the home. The second time it gave a location I never heard of near to my house. Useless because can't even contact you",1
Very bad method of promo codes. I didn't get the expected cash back and hence cancelled the order within seconds and now they are deducting the whole order amount. I am a regular zomato user but cancelled an order for the first time and they treated it very poorly. Really disappointed,1
Pathetic customer service. Absolutely refuse to help if the restaurant has any issue in delivery. They are also notoriously slow in responding to their online chat and do kot give any option to get on a call or request a call back. Deleting.,1
"It'a very worst app.There's no customer care support.No such facility to text a message if u have any issue.I applied the promo code as per it given;but it's shown in my phone by applied price,when the bill came,it's the original price...I'm feeling so disappoint by using this app.👎",1
"@rajkot very bad delivery delay ,think so u are delivery boy is delivering to many of them at a time and coming",1
Suddenly don't know why this is happening app is crashing too badly. Installed- reinstalled n number of times still it is crashing. Sometimes it crashes when we open otherwise it starts to crash when we try and surf the restaurants.,1
"Worst customer support even after multiple reminders to them, they never care about the customers and their query resolution. Better to go with other food delivery apps. Update: I did sent the order details as per your response but didn't see any resolution until now confirming my comment above.",1
"Always loved Zomato's UI. It's the best food delivery app. Their ratings are the most reliable. Can use the app for both food delivery and dining out, which makes it pretty convenient. Zomato's customer service is also the best",4
Poor experience . The service disappoints me the most. My refund has not been cleared even in spacified time . Customer support does not reply you to half an hour. You will be stupid enough to wait for the reply so long. Whereas swiggy does it right on time .,1
"UI sucks! Wanted to place an order so I searched a restaurant but whole page is filled with review sections, gallery and all and order online button is nowhere to be found. Zomato only focuses on creative content but not the user experience.",1
Responsible and healthy tasty food.love it,3
Not a good customer care support... People working in Customer care support call center are very Unsupportive.... I literally want to kick them on their asses.... You order one food you will receive other food if you call or chat with the customer support they will say sorry for the inconvenience caused to you will make sure it won't happen again that's it... Bloody you take the amount for the selected food and you deliver the cheap and different food to the customer Then what abt the money...,1
"Worst customer service. You are ok as long as your order goes well, but the day you get into some problems, don't expect any help from Zomato. They don't provide direct talk facilities to the customer service. They won't even reply to your support request. In fact they don't provide any help at all.",1
"Don't use this.. The worst app ever, they don't intiate your refunds on time, even when my order was cancelled from the restraunts side the app did not update me I was waiting for my order, my order was not delivered and even my money wasn't refunded.",1
"After update the piggi bank coins are not directly added to ones account, but needs to added by self within 24 hours of order which is nonsense as it is to be added automatically like before, also the piggi bank points have also reduced dramatically than before, zomato needs to change this.",1
"So many times I've had wrong orders delivered or the food is messed up and Customer Service doesn't care!The ratings on this app are fake. Pathetic restaurants have amazing ratings and the best restaurants have bad ratings because this app believes in extortion from the food industry. If you are not paying Zomato as per their ask, they'll make sure your ratings are low. Pathetic & very money minded app with no sense of fairness. Would request everyone to not go on their ratings and visibility.",1
"This doesn't have live customer support hence in case of delay in service no one responds to the customer, which is highly irritating and offensive. Leave the delivery on time, my order has got proper response for more than an hour.",1
Zomato is one of the best app for odering food online. I enjoy my delivery with zomato as it given so many offers everyday to that i can try new food everyday. No scams like other apps. There are s0me things which need to be improved. 1. Easier and fast access to customer support via call. 2. Handelling complaints and following up with the guest. This are not big reasons to stay away with this app. I love zomato and the service its one of the must have app in your phone.,4
poor cancellation policy.. I order food that was suppose to apply promo code and it did not give me option to apply my code and it immediately ordered my food.. I tried to cancel the order but there was nk cancelation option. i tried speaking to the representative.. he denied cancelation and said i will be charged with cancelation panelty as per the policy.. what kind of policy is this.. that if i oder somthing i am not given option to cancel and change my order.. frauds,1
Nice and very attractive order boys good behaviour,4
"I have just used the zomato chat help, and it is utterly horrible. My order is 45 minutes late and still awaited. To add to that, their chat app is yet to allocate me an agent since 30 mins, and there is no number to call directly. Amazingly useless customer care!!!!",1
Overall experience is good but some delivery guys are spoiling the name of Zomato. I have personally faced an issue where delivery boy cancelled my order by his own and mentioned that customer not picked phone. While he has not called me at all. Reason for all this mischief was he had to deliver on third floor. He reached my apartment gate and returned from there with out delivering. He returned the order to shop and in place he ate one item from the same shop as my order was prepaid. Ridiculous.,4
castomer support not help..,1
This pathetic service has taken over Uber Eats and for what? Most of the restaurants that I love are now not available to deliver to my place. I can't order from them cz apparently they're not delivering to my location anymore. The interface is so monotonous and confusing one doesn't even realize what to do. HUGE THUMBS DOWN.,1
"Very, Very Candidly, the ""SWIGGY"" Food App is Much, Much Better than your 'Zomato' App! 👎 Your 'Customer Service' is a Joke as You Don't Support Customer Calls, Just Chats!! 🤬 Your 'So-called Discounts' are Only Applicable On Credit/Debit or Online Payments, Not Cash?!? 😡 Your 'Disputes/Refund Policy' is Questionable & Very Confusing, I Still Haven't Been Able To Process My Refund Until Now Since The Last Couple Of Months!!! 😠 ""SWIGGY"" Scores Over You On All The Above Points!!!! 👆",1
The food i ordered was not cooked properly and i requested a refund. The refund was in the form of a coupon and i get more discount from using existing coupons thereby making the refund invalid. This app is such a scam. And the delivery charges are waay high. I do not recommend this,1
The fastest and fresh food dilevery,5
"poor service. scam. lost a few bucks couple times as the order was delivered to someone else. fml zomato strikes again. they do not update their app regularly and as a result, i ended up placing and paying for an order which the restaurant could not make and the restaurant made me cancel the order. on top of it they are now levying a cancellation fee. the chat support system never works. Everytime they are ""flooded"" with enquiries.",1
"What is wrong with you guys. Policy changed for people who are already using it. How come it justifies the existing customers? People who are using it from a long time. Total number sitting on table(even number)/2. This many gold can be used that to if there are 3 people only 1 gold can be used. Of 5 people only 2 gold can be used. If you're doing this then include all food items( beverages,Thali) everything unless it's cheating. You're definitely going to lose costumer base because of this type of MANAGEMENT.",1
"A terrible application and zero customer service!!! Not even once I got my food on time, at least 20-30 min late every time... note: I live on delivery so that's three meals a day for more than 6-7 months. Talabat are way better I wish I could rate them to zero",1
"Several restaurants not available at all times, even those that were available at the same location on UberEats. If you couldn't manage them all, then why bother buying the app?? This is really annoying. Moreover, the UI is really messy.",2
"Earlier i had given good feedback to your services but nowadays i think these zomato people are just cheating us by giving too late deliveries and also with incomplete/wrong delivery, this is just not acceptable. It has been 3 times the case with also very poor customer care support unlike Swiggy. Hope you'll improve this. Thanks.",1
"worst food site ever ..the first time i tried zomoto ,added food to my cart and thought will finalise order in last before payment mode ..but i dont know how it was connected to my paytm wallet and it got paid ..so, within 30 sec i canceled the order but i was panalties for 360 rs .. they told me that food preperation was started in 30 sec just next to my order and infact in the process of this 30 sec. i got notified that becos of rush in restro order food will be delivered bit late ..awfull",1
"Had a complaint but the zomato chat was showing that it cannot connect to service. This keeps happening to me. Whenever I have a problem, I cannot even complain since their zomato help chat doesn't work. All other feature are working except the zomato chat. 😟😟😟😟🙁",1
"Guys I would definitely suggest you ""NEVER EVER go this pathetic service"" 😠😠all you will face would be worst experience. If you just told to them to just wait till 5 minutes they automatically cancel your order as well as charge all your money without delivering it to you.They would definitely ask you to write an mail but nothing will be happend.Again request all of you don't get manipulated with the offers they just are ""FAKE"" what you will face simply putting your usefull money into a well.",1
very disappointed with the online payment option given. there is no support from ur zomato chat team on it. they only send computerised genrated message for any reply. I paid twice for my order but transaction got cancelled and my payment got deductes from my account. not at all secure and trustworthy mode of payment.,1
Worst app and worst customer care support tgat they cancelled the order just because the delivery boy went to the different location and not able to come back to exact location such a worst experience with this.... One time it takes to correct location but second time it takes to different location which is so bad...,1
"I wish I can give negative rating but I couldn't bcz only one left, I ordered food after completely 24 hrs fasting, these people simply canceled my order and they are saying we refund your money, is this rt thing to do , if u having issues u need not accept orders , u confirm our orders then you rejected without our knowledge, seriously I want..................guys , the worst service, don't use this worthless service who doesn't care about customers need .",1
"When its required, you won't find Zomato contact number. When I want reach over chat, they won't respond. if Zomato is having overhelming customers not having time for me, its time to check for a different provider. I strongly believe Customer is King, if not Zomato I will get service from XYZ.",2
It's all going towards bad experiences...late deliveries... everytime i mention some cooking instruction...but wht i receive is always exactly opposite...we cannot cancel the order but the restaurant can cancel it even after half an hour... pathetic experience for past few orders...no customer support service....,1
"I placed the order, after sometime I got a notification as your order has been delivered but I didn't get my order. I contacted to support dept and they chatted with me almost half an hour and then they left without any conclusion. This is zomato customer support system... Actually I want to upload conversation screenshot but am not getting any upload file option",1
Worst App. Payment often gets stuck and takes so many days to get refund. I paid aroound 450 bucks for multiple orders and did not get any food. Dont choose online payment option if you dont want your money to be stuck.,1
It has simplified interface does take time to Find listings of restaurants even shows available restaurants at nights compared to other apps as I am from Nagpur not that famous for night life but it seriously need to find night open restaurants because I mostly order at night and it doesn't lag and until now I had smooth experience.,5
"Worst ever app, no proper support, only way to complaint is to have chat with bots, all the time robotic automated answers, my 3 redunds are still pending, they are cheaters, looting us by giving any faltu technical excuses. I uninstalled the app, there are many othet apps there, with real human customer care supports who TALKS TO US. NOT RUNNING AWAY OF TALKING TO US. Zomato is BULLSHYTS. I am planning to sue them, not for the loses i beared of rs. 600-700 and so, but because they are cheaters.",1
The worst app ever. No time to coustomer srevice. Never pretend to help a coustomer. I recently placed a order by mistake .but after it im trying to contact the coustomer service for my inconvenience. but they didnt reply me for 2 hours .. and after canceling the order i get the whole order value to be pay as a penalty of cancelation.....and my cod facelities are also banned . 🤕 this is really a very 3rd class application.😡.and im not going to install this later 🤢,1
I ordered a pizza through zomato and i got it with all the toppings stuck to the upper side of the box and all i could eat was bread. I did chat with the customer support however they offered me no solutions. Adviser said neither the refund was possible nor the replacement. I didn't expect this at all. Very bad service.,1
Worst app... I'm really disappointed with the customer care.. I have complained that food have stones in every bite and thrown food in dustbin... They have asked to take food from dustbin and send picture.. I really feel very bad to use this app. Such feedback I never faced from any of the food vendors... Worst app ever,1
Service of Zomato os getting worse day by day.. from sending awful food to not providing an agent to talk to.. Zomato is getting a money tease.. literally ! Awful !!,1
"dont ever use this app, the customer support stop replying if they missed the order they dont even tell you if the order is not available , ull keep waiting then after n hour he will ask you to replace the order , after n hour ok. can u keep patience for an hour and later wait more for the replacement. better use swiggy. ( i have screenshots)",1
"Offers and discounts are good. But price for same dish from same restaurant is often more compared to Swiggy. Recently, it says 'Currently not accepting orders' while it is available in Swiggy. May be Zomato's way of promoting other restaurants.",2
Most of the times missing ordered. Rude behavior from customer care while checking of my not delivered. No response for missing order. Frustrated with the provider. Few stores are only available in this otherwise I would have deleted this app.,1
"Had ordered food today, and it was randomly cancelled by them because my number was not reachable which was not the case. They have a non refundable policy. And when you lodge a complaint, all they can say is ""sorry for your inconvenience"". Terrible service. You are goinf downhill.",1
worthless app..they accepted order 10 km above and cancelled after 1 hour and say m not dilvered order above 10 km..but not tell what's mistake of customer who waiting his food with empty stomach..and when talk with support team for above issue ..they give me 77 rs..its my value of one hour...for zomato owners.. m said in my wallet have 150rs take it...just like a tip..m uninstall that app,1
"I made an immediate complain against subway order in the month of October, but the issue has not been addressed since then.I requested again and again but all in vain. Its the end of the year and still no resolution.",1
"Zomato support is not opening from the time i have updated last two updates... And it's irritating... I ordered food at a wrong address, didn't wanted the food to get wasted. Tried to reach Zomato support but nothing happened. Kindly rectify it ASAP.",2
Why cant i pay cash on order above 350 but others can!!! I checked!!! Its frustrating!!!!! It showed i can pay cash on orders above 350 tooo but just once!!! But others can pay cash no matter how many times or how much they order!!!! Its soooo buggy!!!!! The app is buggy!!!! Worst!!!!!,1
Very bad experience..it was good at first then I started receiving wrong orders ..missing items ....some of my orders used to get rejected ...Refund was very late ...chat support is the worst thing ..they will not guide us properly ....I would give minus rating for this app,1
"I loved this app, but now I don't know what happened to it, I can't find same restaurants which I could find before easily. New changes are not user friendly at all. I am out...... .",2
"reducing one star, as the delivery boy keeps getting the wrong location even if the same is seen from my app. im able to see the delivery persons location but then the delivery person keeps getting a new address each and every second . one time is shows a different location and in the next seconf the location just changes",4
Extra charge is too high,1
The customer service and experience is torturous. I am a long time user and a gold user too. I had a very bad experience on Zomato and they failed to take accountability for the same. I have learnt my lesson and vow to discourage people from signing up on Zomato. They have ripped me off my money. And also I'll be taking up my issue with the consumer forum.,1
"At first, the packaging is good but not always. And I haven't had recieved cashback once for a order which was wrongly delivered. apart from this, it's a good experience.",3
I ordered food and they are saying that you have given wrong address and address was correct and they cancelled the order and they have alsi not refunded the money. . and their chat support is also not replying ..😡😡 Its better that directly go to the hotel . this app is useless.,1
"products are missing in the order.They dont understand,people order food bcoz they are hungry and you forget to deliver half order to them and very conveniently refund the money for the item missing.You have to understand the person bear loss of delivery charges as well.You dont refund it and he has to order again,ending up paying double delivery charges",1
The customer service and delivery service is awful. i dont even have words to describe it. the delivery guys shout and yell infront of customer care and they are not even bothered. including rejecting my order and asking me pay the fine. these delivery guy was asking me to share my WhatsApp location as it was SO difficult for him hear me on phone. this app sucks going to order from swiggy now. because after 1 hour of yelling they cant deliver food,1
The app is glitching location and showing the wrong location to the delivery guy. Please fix your bug or glitch whatever it is,2
The only app which i trust for food in the world as i have gone through almost 70% of the world,5
Online rates are very high compare to the actual restorant rate. Many times i obsreved this. Only the reason switch to swiggy,1
"Still waiting for Refund from last 4 days, while ordering food you Required money at the same time, but for Refund 5 to 7 working days. Come on Rating 0. Bad experience, hope the refund Amt will be full without any charges if you guy's refund.",1
"It was great using this app. I am even a gold member but suddenly app stopped working. Always giving error ""something is wrong try again"". I have good net connectivity but not sure why I am not able to use currently. So the bad rating is only coz of this error",1
"am really love this app. I never order food on online but now am first time order zomato it's very useful and quick response, delivery boys also friendly and kindness am see. still am didn't move to other online food delivery, am only order food from ZOMATO only. Superb ZOMATO always rock. thank u all the team 😍😍😍 kind heart support from Tamil nadu",5
Good app for food,5
"Best app.They just not deliver food, they deliver satisfaction to the customers.If you have any problem regarding your food or delivery, they make sure to solve the problem asap and even compensate if you have genuine issues.The system is so quick, smooth and organised.I recommend everyone to use this as it gives best service.Just loved ZOMATO.",5
"Absolute CHEAT! I got wrong food delivered, but I didn't get full refund!! I'll never use Zomato ever! Bloody Cheats😠",1
Zomato offers are good. But their customer support and after sale support is the most pathetic I've experienced. Placed an order that showed accepted by restaurant. Waited over 120mins for a 30min wait time. Zomato Valet was told order not accepted by restaurant but no info to me. Cust support unreachable on phone and no response on chat. Rather disappointing.,1
"good experience, all types of food available with multiple options, 1 star to 5 star restaurant is available. they changed bit higher from restaurant , and deliver charge extra. extra cost should not be charged.",4
The new feature does not allow you to chat with customer care. You are on your own to call the restaurant and manage. Why even have a app if you are not going to support your customers during trouble. You make money from restaurants stating tht customers book from here but you do not give any service to customer. This is highly disappointing. Likewise in other countries ppl will refuse to use your app in near future. Good luck.,1
"Waste app.. Even though I didn't receive the order.. In the application it is shown that order has been delivered.... Very bad support... Very late response... And moreover queries will not be solved... No chat support and only u need to mail them, response is very late",1
"Used to be awesome,, but since 3 months service in all areas have gone down,, restaurants cancel order, have to wait for refunds for days,, customer service team has no empowerment,, app is very slow ,, only customer suffers at the end",1
"Service is quite good, but I am little bit worried that how Zomato is verifying their delivery persons background (may be Police Verification), heard news that few persons with criminal background were working in zomato, this could lead to some more dangerous situations... hope this must have fixed",3
"When I think of the app I get a crowded feel.. UI is overwhelming not in a good way. Everything just pops up adds food facts etc. Nice offers only you ppl know how to claim the offers bcos nothing is clear atleast I'm not. And IVR responses for chat, does not give an option to write the only way I can write is to your mail and I want an immediate response like chat not like next day.",3
"Now the restautant called up me and said they cant prepare the order due to some issue with the logistics, either I will prepare something else of the same price or will do a refund. I didnt want to take alternative and suggested for a refund. The delivery agent called back and said ""Sir, your order is cancelled by the restaurant"", please call customer care for refund. Now when i called customer care they refuse to refund saying that, we cannot repay for the food thats wasted!!!!!",1
"Iam a gold customer. 30 minutes or free. Got 200 coupon only. Why you indicated 30 minutes or free then, you should have simply state, you'll get coupons.. Why so ambiguity. Why some restaurants having high prices like 40% higher compared to original price there..",1
"best service. i ordered with wrong address ( my office address rather than my home address ). so i talked to the representative. delivery boy delivered to my home without charging me anything extra even tough my home was 6 km awayr from my office and out of delivery range. in short, best service.",5
"I regularly order food online... Most of the time i got good service... But my last order and your customers support services made me to give you 1 star and write this review... I received expired food and when i asked zomato to do something about this... They just gave me advice that dont order from those restaurants.... Cheap service, bad experience, uninstalling this app... All of you who is reading this please dont install this app.. They won't solve your problem after they got paid...",1
"It has a good Ambience, the service was ok, taste of the food was awesome, the quantity was also gud, the costs were reasonable according to the taste with quantity and quality, overall rating to this restaurant would be 4.5 out of 5. Do visit this restaurant",5
Those shops r just stone through my house u charge 40 rs for as delivery charges .... It is just a trap items are more costly then they are on those same restaurant s where they delivered from .... Delivery service is wrost ...,1
Most disgusting and pathetic food delivery app. I wasted one and half hours and tried 2 restaurants still didn't get any food. The reason they provided is that they have a technical glitch. Such a disappointment.,1
"not at all satisfied with the kind of delivery they offer. No efforts to meet the deadline. Lame reasons like ""you didnt pick up the call so we went back"". What is the need to call again when you already have confirmed the order and you have address to deliver? I dont understand. Bad service and worst service recovery.",1
"I feel Zomato online food ordering sucks. You cannot track food delivery, cannot search good restaurants. There is no time constraint on which a user can rely on. No guarantees at all. Bad care management and bots need to be upgraded , should keep more chat agents",1
This app is very usefull for me and this app survices is excellent.,5
"Very difficult to use and not at all intuitive. All pages, menus are very complicated. It should be made simpler, cleaner and easier by a huge margin. Every page looks very cramped. It's really pathetic right now even though the offers are really good.",2
"Combining multiple deliveries from same hotel has delayed my order by 1 hour. Although the concept is good for cost saving, it is done at the expense of higher waiting time and that being done when you had charged extra for peak hour.",2
"i have been ordering in zomato for 6 months... Best offers, nice service, COD, 5stars🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟.... everybody was happy happy until....(horror bgm) LAST UPDATE.. no body is delivering to the very same address ive been using for the last 6 months... if i die starving, zomato is the sole reason for it...so, pls fix this... u guys can still make everyone happy...",4
"I like this app and the offers are very nice and also the management ,and the delivery boys are of nice nature and also listen to the customer's issues and problems. I am requesting from my side that if you want food to be delivered safely and punctualy then order from this app and first download it. Thank youuu sooo much Zomato team.",5
its very quick nd easy delivery nd too quickly order is made nd come to us... i just loved this app as they also do home delivery's in any kind of area if it is far also thn also they don't do objection or cancel our order they just make sure we will be satisfied...lovely app nyc nature of delievry boys.. never miss behave wid me...nd its very fast service if something happens for our food also they just apologize for it also...happy satisfied also .😊😋quality of foods nd restaurants is awesome,5
"One of the worst food app, which was created for cheating people. At first it was good, but recent times it started looting money from people. First it shows transaction failure and then ask to pay again, if we do so, it will take two orders. Just coz of this junk app I have been charged twice the amount which is of 3200 and the customer service is hopeless in serving us. Guys this app is not genuine anymore.",1
The best food ordering app. Throughout the year they are giving discounts. That's something new. And believe me prices including delivery are really cheap when I order through zomato than what they are when I personally visit.,5
"This is not done. You can not change conditions with which we have subscribed post subscription. You could have made it applicable to new users but not old users. If this is going to happen I don't won't my zomato gold ID. While i respect your right to alter the T&C for Zomato Gold, at least honour the validity of our respective memberships before changing a policy MAJORLY. Trusted you and paid up front for a year. Don't betray the trust!!!!!",1
"One of the buggy, extremly slow and frustating application I have ever seen. They definitely need to improve their user experience. Uninstalling in a day. They should analys swiggy and its user experience. In short zomato is just a garbej.",1
"Don't like new additional charge i.e distance fee. Can you justify how you charge 30₹ distance fee for the restaurant just 0.7 km? There is no relaxation of delivery + distance fee for gold customer. What is the benefits of investing 1800 in taking gold membership, if I'm not getting extra benefits?",1
Nice.since we r staying in a outer area from the city so it is impossible to go to the restaurant frequently specially nowdays.We r very thankful to Zomato that delivers food so fast.Thanx Zomato,5
Bad service sometimes. They should not deduct any amount before order confirmation. We understand payment refund may take 6-7days but what if people do not have amount left and wants to order the same.kindly request you to not deduct any amount before order confirmation..,3
"Leaving in hostel so I've ordered like n number of times from zomato but their customer service is reducing to zero day by day..even if you get wrong items or missing items in your food ,all you will get is a sorry from there side. Utterly disappointing because zomato's customer service was such an amazing initially",2
Ordered food and been waiting hungry for more than an hour and half still no delivery. Zomato does not offer tracking for the restaurant instead wants us to call the place which does not pick up phone. Went on Zomato chat to report but no one responded ! Poor service overall. Quick only to take money from credit card without even an OTP. Beware.,1
"this is a good app for the delivery of food. but due to some reckless restaurant they are getting blammed. And i suggest zomato to cross check with the restaurants and hotels ,so that there will be the good supplication of food to the customers. thank you.",5
It's such a good food delivery app.... I like the first delevery by Zomato....to make it so useful try to give some exciting offer..... please try toh give coupon...for those people who use the cash on delivery.... methods....but at last it's such a nice...and interesting app😍😍,5
"worst service. for the first order itself the service was delayed more than 30 minutes and in the chat with customer care was also worst like ""it's an app only for co ordination with the restaurant and nothing they can do "" I don't recoment for any of my friends or colleagues... never",1
"I have tried ordering a few times. The app shows reataurant even though they are closed. After an hour I found out that the reataurant was closed, that too after me following up witj zomato. I had guests at my house and it was an embarrasing experience!!!",1
Honest review:- Don't fall for it....they gonna entertain you only if you order daily from them....if you are ordering fewer times...the partner restaurant will send you damage or left over food and Zomato CC will just say sorry and if you insist them upon refund then they will generate a coupon of the refund amount and no credits.... meanwhile they gonna remove all offers from your account....so ultimately you don't get anything... better uninstall and save money and temperament.....,1
"delivery time was ok,within 30 minutes.I ordered chocolate roffles cake,taste was also good.Firstly I found issue while ordering 2 different items from different stores.whenever i clicked add more item,the previously selected item was automatically removed.you guys should work on this.Second thing it does not describe the items available like if u hv to order any dessert they will ask you store on first place how am i supposed to any store if i am ordering something for the 1st time.otherwise ok",3
it was my worst experience downloading zomato. worst mistake of my life. i regret downloading zomato. very poor service during rain.. one night 5-6 of my orders got cancelled.. yes i did get Zomato credit in return but it cannot hide the poor service. i lost all my hopes today . when i bimstakenly ordered food.. and within no time i asked for cancellation. but Zomato refused to cancel my order.i am deleteing zomato. and i will suggest people not to download it.,1
"They had cancelled the order(with penaulty of full paid amount) saying that my number is not reachable. when i called them back, they weren't replying. They havenot initiated any refund processes still. I slept without having anything. very bad experience to pay the food bill without eating it.",1
"Inspite of issue with the your application latest updates, how can you make customer feel bad? Even after adding and selecting new address for delivery l, food went to old address. Customer support team response is slow and cant help customer query! After multiple messages in chat support, they have just cancelled my order. Please do refund my zomato gold membership amout. Im not gonna use zomato from now onwards!",1
"Amazing services. Even though heavy rains, you guys manage to reach & deliver the parcels in time & safely. It is a treat for the working women when it comes to serve the family & relatives in urgencies. Hope, it will keep serving the same & improving the quality with time.",5
Worst Binyamin really water grave and kachembari very low sta6,1
"Though a lot of features are given, the User Interface is very confusing. I could not order food at all. Hence giving 2 stars. I prefer Swiggy. It is much better.",2
"Pathetic customer service team. Had placed am order by mistake and immediately in 5-10 second asked to cancel the order. The customer service team says we cant cancel the order as cancellation is not in our policies and nothing can be done. Also, if we raise the request for cancellation, it will cost you the full amount. Is this really any sort of customer service? Are these guys simply not playing around with customers?",1
"It has the worst customer care, extremely slow. Weird thing is sudden random ""Penalty"" has appeared. These problems have emerged recently. Earlier it was far better and well known for service.",1
Have been using this almost invariably over swiggy (which I use only for Starbucks coffee). Zomato is definitely putting in efforts to improve the customer experience. I guess in the price war with swiggy the scale must've been a lot to handle and the problems I faced then now seem to have been worked upon.,5
"pathetic experience today.. restaurant is just 200 mtr away and after 1.5 hr also order not received.. had a chat with support guy, they cnt cancel the order, if they cancel i have to pay money.. asking me to wait for 5-10 mins, waited for another 20 mins, still order not received.. i am still waiting for my order, uber eat is far better.. thx zomato for very good experience.",1
I had got worst experience as I ordered for almost 1700rs but the food was totally soggy and tasteless as well as messed up.I called the customer care but no response was there even the restaurant people were not answering as well as the order took almost took 1.5hrs to come which is highly pathtic I think that it was a total waste of my money.It think it was my last order from this application as facing such horrible issues on such amount of food will make you lead to take this kind of step only,1
very very poor application because it dosent have the change option in after odering the food if food is not available at restaurant. many items dosent present in the hotel but zomato show to u because u order the food and call restaurat for ur food status and if not available than cancel ur order with selecting without any valid option. i odered chicken fries feom restaurant and he dont have so i had to cancel my order. zomato chardeg me this and not refund a single penny f***k ZOMATO APP.,1
how can you charge unnecessary penal charges when i haven't received any food...and same was cancelled within 10 seconds of order why would I wait for 50 mins...that's the reason for this cancellation and you guys want whole.amount...very Unjustified and very Pathetic slow customer service on Chat...Bye...,1
"Excellent app, better than Uber eat, decent discount, good offers, variety of outlests, smart delivery boys, perfect navigation, need not hv to guide them even ones to reach my address, they upfrontly request u to bring ur own carry bag n gv option to come at door step only on request due to Covit 19 situation, or else they peacefully wait at the main gate to handover the parcel... I love it , Excellent....",5
Food not of quality,3
There is no customer service number and no refund of money if you have paid online and the restaurant calls to tell the item is not available. Swiggy is a far better option. They have very good customer service support.,1
new app is very bad. there was no need to change the old one. just for applying promocode is fine now. but everything other was best for old time ...and live tracking is also a failure now.notification is very slow now,1
"please dont order anything from zomato, they dont have any responsibility other than taking order. if the delivery partner make any mistake, they dont have call facility to resolve your problem even if you have not received your order also they will not refund your money if the order is prepaid. dont fall on 50% off because they have such a partner who will not deliver the order and keep.the amount with them.",1
I placed an order on 2nd Oct 2019 and expected delivery was 12:45 but we got the food at 1:15am.on top of that delivery guy misplaced our order and same day we raised an issue with photo in app and as well as thru email also and til now we didn't get any response from zomato team and that makes us more frustrated also please let us know ur office address to come and speak directly.guys swiggy is far better than zomato atleast they have a good customer support team.it was negligence of their team,1
"Recently happened to me 2 times in 7 days.. when I order something, the rest charges for it and later cancels saying we can't deliver. when I try to contact zomato as they are zomato partner restaurants all they tell me is sorry we can't help. money will be credited back. firstly the Money never comes and secondly is i need the money back why will I order in the first place. It is Pathetic of them to be fooling their customers. Improve !!",1
Good app but customer charges for delivery are high while they charge upto 30% commission from the food supplier.,3
"Worst delivery app ever and the worst customer care, they cancelled the order from their end and not refunding my amount back. I chatted with the customer care, they lied to me by saying that refund has been issued, and they don't have a facility to connect with supervisor one said, the other was like they are all in a meeting, another one was like she can't connect to supervisor because she is new. And the worst worst thing about the customers care is they are all rude......",1
Good food and fast delivery😋😋😋,5
"The app gives wrong informations. Like they advertise that they are giving 50% discounts on ordering from restaurants like KFC, Dominos, Subway, Chennai Express and many more.... But when you actually go to place an order from the restaurant you see that there isn't any offer actually.....",1
The user interface is superb. I'm looking forward for some more offers being floated to me. Please increase the response time on chat support! Happy with the service :)),5
"I had worst experience with zomato, I should say not only thrice but more than that.. everytime you apply coupon it says coupon applied but when u move to payment option coupon automatically removed.. and it doesn't ask to review the order before confirming.. which was the hell experience I should definitely specify. And their new UI is of no use to find anything. and most imp the way of dealing with customer of customer care executives is so rude.. so negative rating.",1
This season really pissed me off. The app closes again and again while using today also I wanted to pay through online option but as always the app got closed and yes of course oder got excepted and I chatted with their customer service about the oder but these guys did not reply at right time plus these guys did unit have any option to either cancel the first oder and oder it again neither these guys gave me an option to pay it online or through card. Pathetic experience,1
"worst application for ordering food. you guys should learn from other competitors how to make Ur app user friendly. from appying discount code to cancellation, its pathetic application.... i cancelled my order within a min a the given discount code didn't reflect but my entire money is deducted as penalty and food also cancelled. U guys r pathetic.",1
"The service sucks... Instead go for Swiggy... the delivery agent packs the food in one instance, in the other instance the delivery agent marks the order delivered... the customer service is of no help either... To your question above, check the chat in app...",1
Have ordered food many a times but recently have been getting my orders very late. Which is becoming very frustrating. When called the delivery guy blames it on the restaurant and vice versa. This need to be checked and rectified.,1
"this app sucks, zomato service gone down considerably. the mazor issue is with false advertising. I'm mean why the hell you dont show actually delivery time. a person needs to plan 2 hours ahead before ordering ?the order is never on time and it makes it so worthless. I'm writing this review while waiting for my order which is already 40 min. late and still in preparation stage. I was shown 30-45minutes delivery time which looks like will be 1:30 hours now. hell with you Zomato",1
"No customer care support. I have ordered from kfc , after payment app says payment couldn't be processed, but amount is debited from my account. When i try to contact support, i realised that there is no number to contact rather you have to chat through app. Most disgusting part is, no one is there to respond to your charm therr guys just need money from customers, there dont really bother about concern.",1
Wrost and rubbish service. I am complaining since 4 June 2019 still no response. zomato and their delivery boys are making fool to customers. Delivery boy will eat your food and after eating he will force you to cancel order and when you will cancel order you will not get refund as per the POLICY OF ZOMATO. when you will complain to zomato then delivery boy will report that he didn't said to cancel order. please don't use zomato. I will recommend you to use swiggy for best service and offers.,1
"The app design is flawed. Auto location is not there. No option to cancel orders, my order from Domino's was cancelled but the amount was still deducted. However the customers service was good, they were helpful and responded quickly.",1
"Got booked suddenly by mistake while I was checking restaurant, and couldn't cancel it even if I called in the next minute! Pricing was high, had to eat the food I didn't want to! Keep it up guys, all the best to you!",1
Food ordering is ok but the zomato vallets are worst now.what they do is after receiving food from the restaurant they call us and complain about the wrong address .1st I thought it was my mistake and paid extra to receive my food. next time I checked my address clearly before ordering but still the valet said the address is wrong.. I checked on my address which was absolutely correct and I said to valet the address is correct give me yr own no I will send u the screenshot he denied,1
"When I tried to apply the promo code 'ZOMATO', it is saying that the promo code is applicable only for online orders. How else do you think I am ordering if not online? It might be showing the wrong Error message or might be having some other problem. But please fix it. I'll give u a higher rating then.",2
"Your latest update has really messed it up. Poor UI. Not at all user friendly. Lost the ""Eazy"" feature(even after multiple re-installs and re log-ins). PS: Your updates are supposed to make it easier for your customers, not difficult. FIX IT ASAP!!",1
"Placed my first order and really disappointed. The option says if we don't want cutlery. I didn't check it means i need cutlery. I didn't cutlery set, i called delivery guy he asked me to speak with restaurant, i called restaurant and he asks me to speak with Zomata as they don't provide it. If so, why Zomata have that option. We are work place, we order food through Zomata because we don't have time to go restaurant to eat. Now you tell me why should i use Zomato.",1
Having very bad experience with this app. Everytime I go to order in 2 mins the restaurant goes in offline mode. Customer service is also not respondinf to this. The level of this app has gone down a lot.,1
"i placed my order at 9:30 pm, which failed 3 times due to technical issues as confirmed through chat. Now at 11 PM when i already had my dinner, the order got accepted, the rider and restuarant said they cannot cancel the order, and chat says contact delivery boy/restuarant, so i take one of the order...still i haven't got refund for the other 2 failed transactions. This is awefull and ridiculous.",1
Its awesome but i think you should make delivery charges some like cheap.. Or give discount coupons..,5
Zomato and other food apps must stop giving the free food option. You guys finally make the delivery guys pay for their delay which at most times is out of their control. And its not that they get paid a handsome pay-cheque that they can afford to do it. Its unfair business on your part. Sorry but not ordering from you guys any more until a conclusive ending is found to kamaraj episode.,1
Pathetic app. Do not use it for food delivery. Order is not delivered even after 2.5 hours and the status is auto updated to delivered. Customer service says they cannot update the status of the order.,1
"They have started the option that if the food is not delivered om time, it will b free...but not if the valet assigned is within 50 mtrs of ur location...and it automatically shows the valet within 50 mtrs at the specific time provided..and shows the refund is not valid",1
Best app I have used so far. it makes my life easy searching for restaurants of my kind off requirement. customer grievances are addressed quickly. Never faced a hassel in placing order vai this app. food delivery is super fast. It serves your hunger on priority. Gesture of the delivery boys is always pleasant.,5
"My favourite used to be swiggy. But it has changed because of the great service , quality and fast delivery that zomato has to offer. Almost all the restaurants and cafe near me are here in it. I love it ! 😁",5
Not getting much benefit using Zomato pro.,2
"good app...but juz need to update options more...for ex: currently running hotels only must be included in the app...i saw so many hotels not accepting any offrs for the time being,that can be avoided..and also include pic to pic option for checking the status of the order...",4
i give a 1 star because i am terrably disappointed with zomato. the main issue for me is when we try to place am order it should atleast ask for my confirmation. this is kind of process design is very pover and this will give room for wrong order as it happened to me. And i had to buy a food which i don't want to eat.,1
There's no space to apply the discount coupons. I have to use zomato on browser whenever I need to apply a coupon code.,1
This app is good but customer service is pathetic. Its only email or chat if you come across any issue. and you have to wait for more than 20-25 min to chat with live agent. So order on your own risks,2
"I hate being taken advantage of and if possible avoid such services. Zomato consumer services is a joke, ordered a BOGO ie buy one get one item and got only one. The issue was left unresolved with an apology. I think i paid the price and wanted my order and not some apology. Also when my Zomato Gold was deactivated, I got only half of my money back. Never ever buy Zomato gold if you don't want disappointment. Hope to God, I never have to use Zomato services again.",1
very good food..and owners are also very polite..nice place..,5
Much better than foodpanda in my location. Delivers food on time and i like the live tracking feature. Also good customer service. Timely notifications for every status change in your order. Exciting discounts as well.,5
"Service is OK , but you are not uploading actual prices of food on your site as I have inquired about the prices directly on the shop than I came to know that you are actually charging 25 rupees more on a order of 500 gm .(remember this additional amount is not delivery charge you are charging this in addition to delivery charge) EX : I Have to pay RS 150 for 500gm sweet when i directly buy from shop. But when i order through Zomato than I have to pay RS 195.( 20 delivery charge and 25 more)",4
such a worst app they dont even deserve one star.I had ordered for food post accepting my order they cancelled it after an hour now when I tried to reach customer support they were not at all helpful & asked me to mail them for a refund.When I mailed them they say they tried to reach me on my number which they dint do & cancelled my order sayin it's considered as cancellation from customer & as per their new policies they cancellation fee is amounted to the ordered food. pathetic service Zomato,1
"** Most of the times the order delivered is either wrong or incomplete. ** food discription (quantity) is required with most of the restaurants as they serve different portions. ** If you dont tip, then you have to face tantrums from the delivery guy, this ""tip system"" is a scam to maximize profits by exploiting customers and delivery boys. Zomato pays bare minimum for a delivery putting the onus of ""fare payment on the customer in the from of tip"" who is already paying excessive for the food.",1
"Service is just non responsive in my area Valet just cancle order by multiple reason like,bike puncher, tabiyat kharab, accident. and there is no control of Zomato on it. after that they also not response on Zomato Massenger cause of they said my account has multiple dispute, but who is responsible of disputes??? only me cause of again and again I place order?",1
"This app is garbage, they accept your order, they take your money, then you wait for 2 hours and you don't receive your food then they tell you sorry your order was canceled and we forgot to tell you.. And then you have to deal with the fact that you waited for 2 hours without getting anything and then wait for 7 days to get back you money.. What a ridiculous app.. What a disrespectful way to treat your customers.. Rude staffs..",1
"My favourite app to order, has nearly all restaurants, delivery boys are good, before time deliveries. And whenever something bad happens they took the responsibility. 1 star deducted for not covering all but still u r better than others",4
third rate customer service. I had ordered food 4 days ago never got it and it showed as having been delivered. now I have been trying to get a refund but no response from customer service. Hope you go out of business. companies like yours need to go bankrupt. have had similar experiences in the past.,1
"would cut straight to the chase here. two reasons : 1. the food from your network restaurants is pretty good. 2. most importantly, the delivery guys are very accommodating and understanding. and not to mention, extremely well mannered.",5
The support service cant be any worse. Got old stake food and cashback provided as promo code. Next time got wrong item and didnt even get refund becasue i used the promo code they provided. The support people simply refused to provide any help. Worse experience ever.,1
Zomato at always its best .offers promotions and discounts. however one cannot stop order of dry items. namkeen cookies. etc. which is why 4 stars . as they do not get waste. so one should be able to stop order for non perishable items after ordering. if one accidentally place order.,4
"Paid full amount of my order but get few items missing in delivery & when complaint them, they ask to wait for days.....",1
"Nice offers and really helpful, but need to improve your location search. When try to search nearest locations should appear first. Like when in locations where serbice is not availble, search shows results from other countries first.",3
Quick. Boys know their locations.,5
"good food delivery experience, but facing some issues with the delivery address, I entered my home address but it sometimes get delivered to some other address, this issue needs to be rectified according to me..",5
"Wonderful experience till date. Awesome service, sometimes it happens that if restaurant is too far from your home then it will take 5 to 10 mins more than expected delivery time. Promo codes always available and what else you need than discounts!!! Recommended to everyone. Thanks",5
I want to rate this app zero star worst app I can't cancel the order which is pleased accidently I want to order more items from different restaurant accidentally my order placed and I have to use other app for other items. when instantly I complaint in zomato customer care there they are just passing time for the restaurant to accept order then they say sorry sir there is no chance to cancel fraud company. then for 2km one hour delivery time at night. if the app is not user friendly close it.,1
"App is worst as I refresh, list of restaurants change. When I want to give order to a specific restaurant, they saw not accepting orders. When I refresh it appears after another refresh it disappears. I wonder why the app can't be realistic.... What the problem have you guys...!!",1
"Zomato is better than Swiggy, Swiggy has change the price buy the time we make payment. Also Swiggy give useless offers on some bank cards. Not most of the customers can use it. It's totally useless. Also Swiggy doesn't take food card to make payments like zomato. The prices difference is there for same resturant and for the same food items from Swiggy and zomato. I feel there is huge difference . Zomato is better than Swiggy service.",5
Accurate location finder,5
"One of the most reliable Food Ordering apps around. The Customer Care is very responsive and helpful if you have any issues with your order. The delivery guys don't usually bug you with directions, unlike Foodpanda and Uber Eats, because you can set an accurate address on the map. Thumbs Up!",4
A great app for food lovers and busy people around there . It covers almost every good restaurant in and around the locality. Hope it covers the same way in other regions too.,4
No proper support available.If you are picking order yourself then well and good.Because order placement depends on technology which you can rely upon.Whenever we need human intervention like from zomato support or restaurant you will be in fix as you can only pray.Worst is you have already paid for your food and now they will be king.This is what I can share after using this app for slmost more than 1 year.,1
It was wonderful and I have just been felt bad only one time out of more than 28 orders I have placed so it's like it can happen and it was easily handled by zomato but overall it's the best and it outclassed uber eats because I used uber also. I think it's the best food service provider in gurgaon.,5
app not works properly. if we select the gps location took wrongly. worst app. swigy is better than comparing to zomato. refund details not updated on cancel orders(by custmer support). another custmer support number not working. prices also high comparing original cost of restartant.,1
"Please consider your customers based on the value of orders they place. I have been in a chat with your representative on missing order and response was utterly poor. Please ensure call center representative to be friendly and take good care of customers and atleast give them positive replay. Hope Zomato will consider this and please open your eyes, we do have other options in the market",1
worst chat support service they never gives resolution and asked me to mail and i did th same but still I didn't get any response and also I tweeted to their official customer care account they replied to that tweet we will get back to you its been 1 month but I didn't get any update.They are cheaters. they gave me roadside food even though I ordered from a good restaurant and more importantly the plastic cover doesn't have restaurant trademark on it.,1
"Recently the customer service is so bad,i hav ordered the food 2 times and both times order is cancelled and payment is taken from me .another incident occured where address given in the order was correct but the app malfunctioned and gave deilvery boy wrong location on map..who then said delivery location is out side 2km and could not make the delivery.u know what zomato did even if its their app fault(Thier support in chat himself claimed it did)cancelled my order,on thier own without asking",1
"Worst app. Sometimes they will show you promocodes with specific cards, but they wont let you apply same. After taking over Uber eats, they are more disgusting now. Also they take much time in delivery than they show. Takes too long while order through Payzap & finally rejects the card.",1
Worst ever!!! Swiggy looks much better.. This is my first order worth 130/- but it's been one hour n the deliver is not turned up! Your app is just showing 10mins -11mins -13mins since last one hour!! If team Zomato is not interested in such small orders then pls clearly mention! Zomato Goa you are not as per mark!!!,1
"It's request to all please never use zomate, very wrost app, today I ordered kaaju barfi and when it came, it was of very useless quality, it seems prepared 8 10 days ago & whenever I contacted to customer care executive they told me sometimes they do not satisfied their customer, I have also asked for my money refund & take your sweets back but they refused.",1
Very good service thankyou Zomato,5
Very bad service. can't deliver the missing item which is your mistake. you should deliver missing item instead f credit amount to zomato wallet. So that customer use your service again and fall into your trap.and why credit to respective account from which I paid????? this is called cheating playing with people money. Will Never use zomato.and please don't say it's ur policy. Policy is not made for your benefit it's should be customer benefit. People order food to eat not to get refund in stupid zomato wallet.,1
Worst app..beware they will show discounts by in the app..the prices are higher than the restaurants.they show discount on the higher prices and you feel you get a great deal.i am deleting this app coz before ordering it shows a discounted amount and after placing the order I was charged full..the support is pathetic..,1
"Dear team, Absolutely disappointed by the website version. It has numerous bugs. One of them being, when I apply a promo code while ordering, it subsequently gets removed automatically on the payment screen due to which I did not get the promo code discount. Absolutely unhappy with the website version.",2
"Worst among all food delivery apps. I placed an order and somehow i forgot to apply coupon code. I pinged the support person immediately and asked him to cancel the order , so that i can replace the order. But he directly and rudely said 'NO'. He didn't help me at all. Same issue i had once with Foodpanda, they were very supportive and fixed my issue immediately. Anyway this was my last order with Zomato.Uninstalling this app!! Very very very bad service.",1
"Most things are good except the fact that minimum 30rs is charged for tax and delivery and all other than the tax itself on the food, also the delivery boys pick-up multiple orders which leads to late deliveries compared to swiggy. Also the app layout and ui is far more confusing and cluttered compared to swiggy and uber eats",3
"Order not delivered. Took extra money for on time guarantee, and when the delivery did not happen, they said the location that was marked was different. Zomato has been delivering to this address multiple times and hence it is illogical. When you cannot deliver on promise even after taking extra money and find illogical loopholes, you prove yourself a liar. I highly recommend swiggy over zomato.",1
"Worst app, not taking responsibility if we are losing money. Delivery boys are not call and they simply saying that they call us and we are not responding to there call and automatically canceling the order. That cancelled order was taken by the delivery boys, this was done by delivery boys wantedly. Zomato people not understanding this and making people suffer inspite there is not COB option..i lost 141 rupees..",2
very good app...Its easy to place order...Moreover its consumer-friendly..the best thing is that its providing its services at mid-size towns like Nagaon in Assam...kudos to the Zomato team...you are doing really great..the discounts are amazing..Cheers,5
Most of the time it shows the restaurants are unavailable. Sometimes the delivery boy's call doesn't connect to me and order gets cancelled without my fault. It needs to be improved. Otherwise great experience,4
"I really like this app, but please add option to add accurate location for delivery. Its very irritating, everytime we have to explain our address to the delivery boy and they are often not very smart.",3
Super app to order the food,5
The delivery services are worst. first of all they can't decide who is going to deliver your food .then you'll have to wait 2-2 hours. they keep changing their delivery persons many times so that you cant even contact a single one easily. even after wating for 2 hours they say that sorry your order cannot be fullfilled and then you have to sleep hungry. it was my worst experience ever.,1
i am very disappointed with the zomato reacted to my order. i have order food from a restaurant and executive of zomato picked the order. then after picking it i have tracked live location of him for 20 min and i found no movement of him in the tracking. after this in a few minutes i got a message that there is no one at the delivery address to pick the order so it is cancelled and as restaurant prepared u food there will be no refund. this is how they cheated me and zomato didn't respond,1
"I have tried to order food three times now using zomato and it has always been disgusting. If the food delivered to you is bad, then also you have to eat it. Under no circumstances you will get a refund or a replacement of the food. I have followed up with them on one occasion for almost a month and after that they gave me a gift coupon but after a few days they removed that as well. i also found that the prices on zomato are way high then the actual restaurant prices in many cases. BAD ZOMATO",1
Quality is quite good,5
"The restaurants should be checked for the quality of food they provide and they must not deliver something else other than what the customers order,this is the reason Zomato should really look out for..and solve this issue otherwise it's completely waste of money to order on this app .",1
ordered food.. money got debited.. I was continuously tracking the food and all of a sudden the order disappeared. and I got a message that the order is rejected because I was not available. when I called the valet he told me that the address is incorrect. this was the worst experience ever. my mom dad had to wait hungry and this is just not acceptable. after all when I chatted with zomato they said the sorry and that even the money will not be refunded..,1
"Pathetic customer service. I had promo code related issues and also I had to complain about the Zomato valet since he was extremely rude. I told them about this but there was no reply . I complained about it at 10:34 and got reply at 2:10. three and half hour late. and also they didn't solve my issue. their response was - sorry we couldn't reach on time . I hope your issue is resolved by now. Like really , your late reply will solve my issue on it's own, wow.",1
I don't get any coupon codes available and other people are getting it.... I'm a gold member but no need to say as it is useless these days....no worthwhile restaurant are availing it any way....and you guys keep changing your terms of Gold Membership to loop us out of it more... anyway no use....as all this is falling on deaf ears anyways...,1
"Zomato gold is totally wastage of money. Zomato gold is not applicable for full bottle, its applicable only on point. There must be two members on the table. And For 1+1 Dish is also a scam. They show 1 dish at 50%off and when you and second dish the 50% off goes off. Its a scam. Please don't buy zomato gold. Total wastage of money.",1
No proper app maintenance. Closed restaurants are listing in app and placed orders are getting cancelled by mentioning as restaurant is closed. Why closed restaurants are being listed? Zomato valets not arriving on time. Most of the they are roaming in different areas without delivering my food.,1
Not good at all compared to the old app..... M not able to place order anymore... It says can't be delivered to my address ...in the past they have delivered food on the same address many times.... Will you guys fix it or what happens now?,1
"poor facility. each time I search for a restaurant and try to order something , it shows restaurant not accepting order. If it doesn't want to accept the order then the app management should remove the restaurant from its app . Please see into this problem. And do learn something from Swiggy.",1
Just provide customers a option that they can even talk to you rather than providing restaurants numbers because we are ordering from your app not from the restaurants.. This was the worst experience I have today.since I received my order after 2.30 hrs. This doesn't make any sense.,1
I don't like the new update. Limiting the search in my current location is tiresome. I can opt to input the location where i want to search but that would mean i have to input or search twice: 1 location and 1 restaurant,1
"A good app for food delivery, does not provide as many offers as its competitors, but takes care to expand its service everywhere, even in remote areas, have to appreciate that",5
Its great experience i had with these kind of food services provide......like Zomato...i think we have to raise our voice against these kind of service provide......many times i had raise complaint to zomato via chat communication but result was in this kind of words.....sorry we can not return the money..if u order was incomplete......is this my mistake...that order was incomplete...?? Another issue was chat rply time.....its taking 15 to 20 mnts....our time is also precious for ur.....finqlly..,1
I have had both a wonderful as well as satisfactory experience with this app as well as the delivery service and the support team was also quick enough to respond to my inconvenience once. So overall I find this app very convincing as well as helpful to satisfy my hunger strokes!,5
"Zomato never care about there customer, only focus on shopkeepers. I complained about my previous experience but did not get any solution. I was told to escalate my issue by writing email, I did after few days I got just a apologies email from an agent call Nandani, I have not got any solution. She was not having time to read the email, just simply sent an email with apologies just a formality. Still awaiting for response after sending couple of reminder.",1
I ordered a pizza and when I got it delivered it was crushed because the delivery guy was carrying it wrongly. But when I contacted customer support and asked for refund they said the pizza seems to be can be consumed so they cannot give the refund. If this is the way you treat the customers. Really appreciate ur concern about ur customers and this was not the frst time this is happening.,1
"Worst experience ..why you guys showing dominos in your app if you are not delivering the food ..your supporters told me that we are not handling dominos deliveries than you guys should remove dominos from your app . I can also directly order throught dominos online order site but i preffered to order from zomato that your services might be better but i was wrong. Your support is just sending auto replies to customer not having any solution. Worst service worst support,remove dominos from Z-app.",1
"i had ordered a cake there is an ant on the cake the quality is vry poor and tha quantity is nott like to be appear in the shop. Delivey is also not on time and tracking is not at oll working,need to be improved and test such shops or remove such shops from the list.",1
"The app takes time to confirm the food order. One of my orders was delayed by a half hour just for confirmation, and though I had requested for cancellation of order before confirmation after 25 min of waiting, the order STILL got confirmed!!",3
I didn't expect bad customer service from Zomato. I ordered from Pizza Hut on June 28th and got incorrect order. Delivery boy didn't check the order id and delivered swiggy order. I tried multiple times from zomato app customer service and no response. I dropped mail and followed up multiple time and worst is no one is responding on my mail too. Expexted better service from you.,1
"Quite dissapointed because all other people got 50% off on first 5 orders,I never got it.Even when i was a new customer I could'nt see that offer for me whereas the friend of mine got it.(both of us installed it nearly the same time).I have been ordering without that offer ever given to me.Surely you people cheated me. :( yeap,unhappy!! Also sometimes those delivery boys are a headache asking for our phone just to give themselves 5 stars Irritating!!!",3
The delivery experience in Dubai is terrible. Since it has lots of restaurant so I was opting for that but the delivery.. Everytime I am getting late delivery. The food goes cold . The delivery guys are very careless. They don't even compensate for bad experience. Extremely bad experience. I think I happy to pay more to restaurants to deliver than to pay zomato.,1
Pls don't use this app to book the order because this guys are not responsible if they missed any item in the order and they will not resend missed items. But they will give promo coupon for missed item and you should use it with in 30 days.. I don't like this one..so I'm giving very bad rating..,1
"Very bad app to order food and they don't even provide the customer care number to call...I faced bad experience with zomato I ordered biryani through zomato I gave full address in address line and forgot to navigate my place , the order was placed and I did the payment also..the delivery person went to the place where navigation shows and telling me your order will be cancel and amount is non refundable as you not set the navigation properly and I tried the customer. Care the no is not availabl",1
"Pathetic service , Tell me whats the use of adding special instructions if no one bothers to read them . Issues are never resolved , talked to the customer support multiple times they only apologise or say they wil esacalate the issue but no response after that . Super disappointed . Signing off from zomato . A mere waste if money.",1
"Prices on Zomato are different than actual prices at the restaurant and customers are being fooled big time!! Ordered food from Rawat Food Point in Ludhiana and prices on Zomato were far higher than at the restaurant. Gravy Champ Combo - Price on Zomato is 170 while price at restaurant is 120, Cheese corn pizza price on zomato is 160 while at restaurant is 140, price of rumali roti on zomato is 15 vs 10 at restaurant. Ended up paying more despite all claims of discount!!",1
"I wish I could give zero or minus star, pathetic service. I received incomplete order, didn't receive any refund even after following up on email 2nd time my money got deducted and order did not get placed. Worst thing is chat support does not work. Absolutely pathetic service.",1
Zomato dosnt show it on the app when their valets has multiple deliveries. The delivery time is not changed accordingly and end up delivering the order very late. I had raised the issue on the zomato feed back mail too. But it's been useless.,1
"I was thinking to order something but my mind changed so i wished to remove the things from cart but by mistake order got placed and even no cancellation procedure was available on it.I faced problem in it and i was forced to accept the order. However the order(burger) was so bad in taste it was cold.So, i suggest everybody not to install this app. Very Disappointing",1
"Fantastic now...fast refunds , immediate actions...good to see... But they have send me a cupon code by mail but it is not working there is no validity mentioned,when I click it redirects to zomato app but not able to apply.this has to be corrected by zomato.",5
"Worst app and services ever! I used to order from zomato often. But most of the time my special instructions will not be followed. One of my commonest special instruction is ""Do not want any onions please"". I'll get allergies if i consume onions. And wasting more than rs300 but not eating it is a heartbreak.. I used to report about it to customer care but they still repeated the same thing again and again.. At last they blocked my account n phone. Mistakes were clearly from ur side! Good luck!!",1
The app is useless..i paid the money through debit card..it got failed they kept the amount and the order wasn't placed either. The app keep the money and you are automatically logged out..then it shows something went wrong.,1
The order I have placed has been messed up. I had to wait for 1.5 hours and end up cancelling the order for no mistake of mine. Even after that I did not get the complete refund money back. Horrible experience.,1
Only reason for this low rating is that there is no option to cancel the order placed. Shopkeepers accept the order and then give a call saying that they dont have the thing you asked for and they offer to replace that with something else.,1
"The real price in restaurants are way less than what they offer , and then they give 30%-50% off .what u r actually paying is the real amount. Go and check the restaurants if u dont belive me. For example Think i ordered food ""A"" for restaurant ""P"" The restaurant price is rs100 The same food is available in zomato for rs150 Then they give 50%off so it is now rs75 Then they add restaurant charges and delivery charges and make it cost rs100.",1
"I have been chasing for my refund for almost a month and there is no response on chat and email and I have faced many issues related to bad qualityof food, order paid but not deliveredand they didn'teven bother about delivering and refunding the same, delivery executive's behaviour issues etc. etc.",1
Delivery boy not in uniform. No mask.. no handglows location awareness.. food thanda tha,3
"An order that was cancelled by Box8 in December 2019 still hasn't been refunded. I have no issues with the app, but with the service is pathetic! To top it off I bought Gold membership too! My money is stuck regardless.",1
Bad or Worst experience I would say. no customer support no way to reach them. Selected an order showed me different amount however once I placed an order i got amount higher than showed me earlier. By the way it was not taxes but some other amount... Very Bad way to cheat customers suggest others to try Swiggy or Uber...,1
Food is not delivered and support is also very poor. For 1st 1hr there is no response after that some response coming and chat window not working. Finally food is not delivered and money also not get returned. On top of that they marked order as delivered.,1
"Zomoto is froud they never give refunds on their own mistakes also it's a froud you are wasting your time and money if you are using this . Various times i applied for change in valet and food our complaint against food but they never responded and every time they just say thank you for your feedback , so if you don't wanna waste your hard earn money then uninstall it , and rate them 1* because they are not going to refund your hard earn money , use some other apps",1
i order food on 17th apr through zamoto R R RESTAURENT ...i paid the bill through credit card ..at the time of processing of payment some error appear on screen 2nd also same problem..i lost money i didn't receive food..it is worst app..we can directly orderd food from restaurent..offers also fake..cost also very high...worst worst worst app.. ans iam trying to customer service..it is also connecting..,1
zomato did not pass my accurate details (including an exact Pin location of my building) on to the restaurant fulfilling my order. Received multiple phone calls from the delivery person asking for directions. The order took 1.5 hours to process and deliver.,1
"Worst app ever. I have faced a lot of technical issues. This app needs upgrades. Firstly , i faced an issue where my money got stuck online and i recieved no food. Now I was just cheking a restaurant and the order placed automatically. SHAME...",1
Hatered app for a cause all the coupons and offers are expired at once the food is added to the cart to check the eligible price of the product without making it place,1
Ridiculous app and customer service... My first order and delivery guy is saying he is going to pick another order coz he got a message then who will deliver my order. No customer care number to call ans chat is the option available...really shity approach of doing business.,1
Good app for food 🥝,4
"The worst service by the delivery team, had almost 8 issues with food orders out of 10. This shows nearly 80% of their costumer service is worthless. And if you reach them, their replies are very vague, pointless and disappointing.",1
"Delivered the wrong order. And extremely poor customer service when I tried to contact them. And this is not happening for the first time. never had any such issue with swiggy. to top it off, such a waste of time and an absolute idiot manning the customer service who cant even pay attention. Do not use this app.",1
"my order is delayed,order not confirmed from30 mins,there is no option of delivery boy,app is hanging, customer service is unavailable,so we cant complain anywhere, literally this is the stupid app and stupid service. u can go for by ordering yourself by calling at restaurant. dont depend on this app",1
"very bad experence with zomato,i got my order very late approx 45min even tracking status was showing that your order is on the way while resturant is only far awy from me jst 1km only,than second issue rider was miss guiding me with his location and miss behaving with and the main issue the rider was not the save person whose detail they had provide to me..it was my lst order now i will never prefer zomato.",1
There is no way to talk to Customer support. Only chat. Wanted to change the delivery address soon after booking. Waited for more than 15 minutes for the rep to chat continuously pinging but nobody responded. By then the food was already delivered. Pathetic customer support.,4
Worst app not even 1 star... They just know how to play games... They will deduct money in first place... And make ppl wait for last 2 hrs and 3 4 delivery person will change and dnt have proper customer service facility. And then there manger will apologize and will say nicely ur money will be back in 7 working days... They dnt think about the customer hunger.... Worst pathetic service,1
"I suggest you to not make payment before your order is received, they will not refund your money. My order was late so i cancelled my order but i have made payment and they are not refunding the money back. I am very disappointed by the services.",1
"Very bad service by zomato and the restaurant also the delivery boy ,first the delivery boy was asking me to come to the location he was on when I denied he came to my location after receiving the order I found there are no plates and spoons, after that I found that quantity is not enough , I have ordered 3 plates of chole bhatoore 6 pieces and have got 1 packet of chole only , around half bowl , when I complained to the restaurant they changed up the call and said krdo complaint zomato ko ...",1
"Great choice of restaurants, some attractive offers on dine out food & drink as well as delivery and easy to use. Could have some more mix and match filter combinations. For regular restaurant goers and those that enjoy ordering in, a great money saver.",4
Awesome service awesome offers Awesome packaging and Handling... just one recommendation that atleast if there is an inconvenience reguarding order atleast provide a small offer as compensation... bcuz everytime when there is mistake the agent says we will make sure this mistake doesnt repeat and still its repeated and so what do you expect?? Only thing that zomato needs to improve,4
No more stars!Simply it's horrible n irritating app bcoz no delivery available at my chosen location Villupuram! After all Villupuram is a city!,1
"Worst experience of the food delivery service, ordered the food, it got accepted, partner was assigned and after that everything fell apart, restaurant phone was off, delivery partner's phone was off, I reached out to support but they were unresponsive, it all lasted for 2 hours after which they cancelled the order. It was really a very bad experience.",1
"Zomato Pro just not worth, lot of issues in payments and pro help. People assigned to help us just leave without resolving the issue, they don't even bother to read what we type. If payment fails, coupons disappear. They even took away uber eats which was wayy better! Go for swiggy guys!",1
This app was great but over the last couple years it's getting worse and worse. It doesnt keep up to date with new restaurants opening in the city. The restaurant categories are terrible and seem like they are based on advertising. Uninstalling.,1
Its getting worst..as I ordered my food right now but I got to know that 50prcnt coupon is not applicable on pay on cash..so I contacted customer support that cancel my order.. within a 3 minutes of order they are saying that it can't be cancelled as the food is prepared .,1
Needed to add to order after placing but makes you do a new order no option to change. Poor efficiency and now 2 drivers delivering to the same location. Very poor app when you consider we are all supposed to be reducing carbon footprint to save the earth.,2
Poor customer care. Can't handle the issues instead of resolving issues timely they will try to cheat/manage with wrong updates. Useless chat support. Waste of time by using this useless app. Hey Zomato: don't be in this business if you can't improve the customer support function. You should feel ashamed for the poor customer support.,1
""" 1250 Rs wasted"" I had ordered some food from this app. And that was worst in quality and have insects in it. So i simply complained about that incident with attached photos. And i threw that food. I got a message that they will do something. And after a month passed i didn't get any refund or any other kind of message till now. Very bad customer support. I will prefer to order from other apps like swiggy , food panda.",1
"Till now everything was perfect, however a mistake happened recently where zomato took payment on my online order yet the order status was ""incomplete"" and I couldn't contact them because simply there's no even a phone number, just a useless support chat!",1
"Make an option in settings to turn off the annoying pop up every time I start the app, asking for my GPS location. . Its not about pricacy or anything, . I just find it extremely annoying that the app asks for my location every time I open the app, it should use the last location I used for ordering.",3
This is first and last time i made a mistake to place order in zomato. money deducted from credit card and due to some error order is not placed. chat option in mobile is kind of a joke i am waiting from 30 minutes and it says to wait 1 more minute. no body is even answering the call.,1
"ordering from zomato is like getting mentally harassed, even after 1.45 hrs of time I didn't got my order and none of the person were traceable (restaurant partner, customer support, delivery boy), we requested for cancellation by sending several message to support team but got no response so we visited our nearby restaurant and had our dinner their and after few minutes received reply from zomato and that too with negative attitude of charging full order amount as penalty. highly disappointe!!!",1
never order from zomato its the worst app they never take the responsibility..they always have one answer talk to the concern restaurant...nd the restaurant people give you great offers but deliver something else which we havnt ordered...sometimes they just cancel the order saying the outlet is closed better paying a bit more nd ordering from swiggy,1
"Order delivery time shows as 30 mins but it takes like one and half hour always for the food to arrive, instead of that I can just go to the restaurant and have, it's almost the same, should really work on there delivery time.....",3
"it's very useless app, if u order food they don't make the deliver to u properly if u gone for delivery sprt they don't really help they always want to escape from the prblm they don't really help us at the restaurant what ever the restaurant has given they will bring that without checking I'm seriously not happy with zomato I'm thinking 1 star also enough for them that's why I'm not giving a single star also but in manual we've to give at least one star to post my feedback that's why I'm giving",1
On time and safe delivery,5
"Stupid delivery service even don't know the landmarks , giving job for all the useless people wasting our time , stupid service ever really frustrating ,😡😡😡",1
There is no proper customer support. I have an issue with my order while try to chat there have there own auto reply we can't chat with them I contact restaurant they are replying in irresponsible way.i order food 6:15 pm and till 7:50 I didn't get my order where we will trace it and how to track waste customer chat,1
"Customer Service team is totally unprofessional. I would say never order from this app just for getting discounts. They never deliver you on time, No Food quality and quantity solution. No solution even when your food is not delivered or cancelled.",1
"Very helpful APP, with live tracking and amazing chat support. One thing to suggest is the Riders must be groomed briefed well before they are given with the ground work. Also for rainy season they have to be provided with the Rain coats. Really great service by Zomato.",5
"this is a very great app, very convenient for lazy people like me and the facility to get food at your doorstep from nearby restaurants at a discount is just amazing. A clear 5 star rating application.",5
"very poorly designed app. no help available on chat. zomato doesn't care about feedback. order section is poorly designed. popup opens up for every new order. no order time tracking. no expected delivery time, unhelpful map shown for name sake",1
"No one to contact for any issue. Sent wrong orders, stale food items. Helpless in such cases. Not happy. Mg 4 year old daughter's birthday is spoiled because of very stale product ( not at all eatable ) delivered from la pastiries but no one to raise issue. Veined pastry spoiled celebration. Must be sued or banned. May i give negative ratings.",1
"The app is crashing every time. I repeat every time when 8 open the grocery sections. I could not review my food as well because the app would crash . I had missing items in my order. Now you guys will ask for a photo ,I can't sent that since it was 2 days ago.",1
"It was a pathetic experience. I ordered the food worth of 600 and it all came poorly packed and spilled and when i reached out to customer support chat , it was least helpful . They offered absolutely no help and all my money went waste. It was really frustrating.",1
Bad experience with my past order.Partial money refunded for my order cancellation.And was only reason why I cancelled because the restaurant kept on asking more time again and again for food preparation.And ya don't forget to add the delivery time after that.which is again approximately 30 mins as confirmed by Zomato delivery guy.Zomato chat told me it is not in his hands to refund money and the help is not possible as I have cancelled.Please improve you system.,1
"i ordered from Behruz in Bangalore and paid the amount online through credit card. the food did not delivered till 2 hours 30 minutes. i tried multiple times to call restaurant and ping in zomato chat. no one responded. after 2 hours 30 minutes, the order shown as delivered but i didn't get any delivery. zomato is a big cheat.",1
"Cheaters in the market. Irrespinsible supoort desk...with no decision making....no common sense...behaves like govt banks. Also, compare the item prices with uber eats and you will see a huge difference. zonato charges box fee over mrp from customers where the packaging is done by restaurants itself. taxes and fees are higher than food",1
"there would be no one to listen to customer issues,they have just an automatic chat response which will never solve problems. It has been 12 days since they canceled my order(from their end) but have not refunded money. Very bad experience.",1
If the image was there to upload i can give the clarity of the zomato menus there are simply keeping the menus high price and give the discounts on those item it will be the same the actual price of the item.This is what the zomato is providing for the people.Please kindly see the prices of the hotels while you are keeping.Dont be simply keep the order from zomato..,1
Every time you order a meal some item would be missing. Which involves a hectic round of calling zomato proving them that we got missing item and then call restaurant to confirm the same. It's a hectic and unfortunate circumstances which we go through.,2
"Pathetic App i hv ever used bfor,u try to type the add manually it doesn't save it,u try to locate it through GPS, it picks up the wrong location n over n above the delivery guy has the density to say that u hv wrote a wrong add,i mean wat do u actually do i fail to understand....jst hv a feedback,wrk on ur app before u tend to loose on to ur customers, cos this frustration will not take u all anywhr as the customer is paying for the delivery also n yet gets irritated at the same time...",1
Zomato service is good,5
"very erroneous. plus customer care needs to give proper resolution to issues. Got an incomplete order and instead of getting me the item, they refunded me the item's worth. I had to order again but had to pay double delivery charges!!",1
"When I search for food, it showing restaurants which were closed. What should I do with the closed one's",1
"useless app, don't use at all, the delivery boys are all fake, they take your order money, give you your food and cancel your order afterwards and you Have to pay for it afterwards. just yesterday this incident happened with me. going to report it to the police now the zomato is also not responding my report. thanks, but this is literally the 5th time I've told my case to zomato customer service, i'm sick off you customer carers, sorry but I'm very much disappointedand don't even want toargue",1
This is very irresponsible service and worst customer service bad quality restaurants don't trusted any people outside is fully makeup inside is very bad quality don't trust.,1
Worst service... absolutely fraudulent....i got the wrong order and went to Zomato's chat service....the first executive chatted with me for 30 min and stated that she is trying to arrange a conference call with the restaurant and then stated that she is unable to connect...i then called restaurant myself and was able to reach in one attempt so i started the chat again and the second chat executive told me that they are not allowed to arrange a conference call and that my issue isn't big enough!,1
"I always have issues with this application,late orders no refunds back ,taking money from my bank for food that it's not going to be delivered. A lot problems,I don't recommend this app",1
Its working nicely,5
"I ordered for first time, it showed payment is declined and amount will be credited to your bank account in 7 days, so i ordered again and then app showed both order are confirmed, after reaching support they said order cannot be cancelled, and payment for both got deducted, worst experience",1
Bring back the delivery boy.,1
Unfortunately the app is NOT friendly user. It's looks like browser page . It should be more pro. The good news is well known app and has so many options. Just over look issues. It must be easy access for users like their compatriots.,1
"The item listed on zomato has price tag more than what it is in the restraunt, and the content of food is also only 75% of what we get in the same restraunt at less price. Overall If we leave delivery charges our food is 50% costlier of what we get in restraunt, and the quality you know better !",1
"Very poor customer service. App places two orders automatically instead of one and wen u contact the customer service, its waste of time. they take time to respond and by that time, the food is being prepared and they say they cant cancel the order and they charge u for the cancellation even wen its not ur fault",1
"The worst experience. Ive used uber eats and swiggy app, comparing to them these guys(zomato) are so irresponsible. No timely delivery, delivery boy hardly gets to my door, every time i am forced to go down three stairs in to the main road to ""recieve"" my order as if i am going to pick up my relative or something(and the response be like me vaha nahi aa paunga).Wonder how this app survives with this kinda service.",1
they are good at delivering but if any issue arises ...ljke the food quality is poor and if u have given some instruction but the restaurants did not follow..the zomato customer care become unresponsive and irresponsibile and i must say they add the restaurants without checking their food quality and standard both.,2
"Going good, the app is nicely set nw dn b4 & more offers are been given which makes d order placing more satisfactory. Please reduce d delivery charges, as sometimes it's very high as 30-40/-. Rest please keep breakfast offers more open around 50% off with promocodes.",4
"Pros- Many restaurant options. Some have great offers. GOLD gets you 1+1 on food &2+2 on drinks. Cons Customer service is fu***d up. Delivery guys and restaurants are messing up all the time. Food spillage, less quantity, not following cooking instructions etc have become an everyday part of my life.",1
"Fraud app, generally. The support is never helpful, regardless of the unreasonableness of the problem faced by you. For instance, I once opted to gave a tip of Rs 50 to the driver because I was in a good mood. Now, I get charged Rs 50 in every order. Without knowing I'm being charged Rs 50 for tip or having any option whatsoever to remove it. The support lies and says I have that option when I don't. When I point it out they give their email ID and end the chat. Scam app..",1
worst food app ever. customer service is horrendous and they are literally bots with no empathy. dont reply on time and dont even address the issue with the order. only bluntly cancel the order and refund. and the user interface is crappy with multiple delivery execitives getting assigned for orders placed. Order tracking showing wrong gps or delayed. The only saving grace being recommendations and zomato gold for restaurants and good places to eat.,2
"Recently I ordered food from Zomato and payment was done online, it was never delivered to me but the status was showing it is delivered. when i called the delivery guy, his phone was switched off. then i complaint to the online agent, but i didn't get any response.",1
Most of the time it's good. One every 15 odd order something or the other happens. Either money is debited from the account and order is not processed or the restaurant gets the order wrong.,4
i work at cargo terminal. i tried to get food from other apps too but they were showing non delivery zone. it was my first time today that i ordered through zomato from my office. i am happy that i received my order within time and the food was yum.,5
Nice app for ordering food but they should remove the bugs and glitches because it interrupts me while ordering,4
Zomato is becoming worst day by day. While ordering they show 35 mins but after order the expected delivery time is showing as 60 to 65 mins. Basically they are assigning multiple orders to the same delivery boy there by delaying the overall delivery. Don't relay on Zomato anymore.,1
Excellent service by Zomato I Love it,5
Best food delivery service,5
"Earlier it was all good, but then whenever i launched the app on my mi A2 smartphone, i have to login again and again whenever i lunched the app. If this problem is not solved then i will have to look for other options like swiggy and uber eats...",1
"Well, a bit good and bit worse i faced so many problems with delivery, whatever it is, they solve the issue nicely. my suggestion add a option to cancel the order in a period of time to avail cash back.",3
"As far as services are concerned, I thoroughly enjoy them but I dunno y the ferry price has gone up from 10 bucks to 25 bucks.... Thats really a pinch and I now am forced to think twice before ordering food.... Revise the rates at the earliest plz",3
We have noticed the prices have hiked drastically compared to actual restaurants prices plus adding delivery charges. It's better to pay cash and order directly from the restaurants. Even the restaurants are requesting the same....,1
"App was nice before some recent updates, now it's not easy to find menu option, location, and it even doesn't show anything once the restaurant is closed.. Please look into these issues, rather changes.",2
"Guys the new pro membership is a scam. It ask you pay more and then shows fake discount. To avail pro discount min order value should be ₹300. Its wierd, I order food twice to thrice a day. Generally it costs 150 -200. But now after getting Pro its asks to add more to get pro discnt. I dont think its for everyone now, not everyone can afford 700-800 rupees for meal in a day. Delivery is absolutely the same, the same rude drivers.",2
Experiences that made me not think twice before deleting this app 1) My order got delivered and there was another phone call telling me to receive my order. I told them i had already received my order why would i pay again for the same thing. now i have an outstanding amount cuz of glitch in their app 2) My order did not get delivered yet the status shows delivered and i payed online. The told me my amount will be refunded. but they didn't refund it and now refusing to accept the situation!,1
"Worst app. Everytime either the food gets spilled or the food is completely cold. Even after Complaining, it's not taken into account. I would suggest u not to install the app. Wastage of time, money, mood n hunger proper actions are not taken. Really ridiculous. I m Uninstalling this app",1
ZOMATO IS BEST ONLINE FOOD DELIVERY APP. ZOMATO ALWAYS CARES CUSTOMER. EVERY ASPECT I REALLY LOVE OF ZOMATO SERVICES. I REALLY APPRECIATE QUICK CUSTOMER CARE.QUICK SOLUTIONS FOR CUSTOMER COMPLAINT.,5
it was confusing that order placed on either address provided by u Or location.. while u provide location then also it provides different option and does not provide exact map to give our location.. it also fails when you want to pay online... also doesn't display exact value to pay after placing cod.,2
"I was about to order food worth 290 and I did not like the way ""tax and charges"" is being presented to the user. it is misleading tat Gov is charging 60 rs as tax. Tax is just 15 rs in my case but it gives impression that 60 rs is tax unless I click tat link which shows splitwise details. In a way u r hiding delivery,distance,parcel charges and put blame on gov. Many ppl assume that is tax and gets negative impression on gov. I will not order on ur platform unless billing is more transparent.",1
The app is great but the only problem is that they dont give the discount theý actually do and the prices for every dish are hiked up hence the discount you receive is actually the real price of the dish that you pay The only positive is that the food is delivered to your doorstep,5
I have ordered many times from this app. contributed with reviews and all. but sorry to say this app is a waste of time. I made an order with card. the restaurant Paavos pizza called and said they can't deliver. contacted customer service. they said they initiated refund and will get it after 7 days wow,1
The app has literally become a chaos. The whole screen is so messy to look at. There's no live order tracking like the one in Swiggy/UE. Downloaded just to give a try for all that swanky adds Zomato spends on. Please spend on making your app more user friendly than just on adds. Uninstalling right away,1
Worst app. The customer care service is Terrible . 500 was debited from my acc however the order was declined. It has been more than a month but I haven't received anything and they are not replying to grievance . Worst app ever,1
"They deny there service last order which they supply midnight and all food cold ...and i chat customer services they telling sorry ...i said through food in dustbin, which is not eat condition .. Simply giving advertising every channel news paper is not important, to give proper service also , sorry to say lot changes is require.",1
The worst app you ever find. These people have deducted my amount and they haven't gave me the confirmation about the order. When I complained them they just dropped the mail that they will try to resolve it and they haven't resolved that problem. And Zomato customary care gives you the bad service. I have called them upto 30 times they haven't pick once also. Guys don't install this app. If not they will deduct your amount and you will starve whole day .. I regret myself why did I choose Zomato.,1
"They show many restaurants as options for food delivery...when we order, they cancel saying it is far...also when they cancel they don't keep a note of tip provided, they don't refund that or they don't have any info of that...We need to request, send mail for that small amount...not happy",2
"***MUST READ 1. Worst service 2. My order was cancelled, I have not received my refund amount until now. 3. The prices mentioned on zomato menu are higher than the prices mentioned on the restaurant personal menu. On top of that they take delivery charges with late delivery. 4. All the people who are reading this please please please always compare the prices mentioned on zomato and restaurant's personal menu. People are being fooled in the name of discount. Discount is actually not discount.",1
The app is great.Delivery and offers are also amazing. But the main thing is that they charge extra 10 or more money as they want to.For example: If the menu shows 170 then in the app menu it will show 190.We order by thinking we're getting discount but they cheat us doing this.,2
I tried to order the food and while doning transaction the payment was failed but they deducted my money from the account. And they are sending message will refund aftr 8 days.. For nothing they deducted my money from the account and saying will return after one week . This i s kind of cheating. I am going to uninstall and ask my frnds to do the same Worst cheating app,1
Every time it hangs in the last page of ordering.i don't know may be beacuse i am a gold member they don't want to give the 1+1 on delivery. One of the stupid app. It went like something went wrong try later every stupid time.. i won't recommend.,1
"Earlier there were so many promo codes but now there are very less promo codes giving very less discount . For new users they give so many promo codes to attract new customers but after some time they decrease promo codes as I mentioned above .. So they should not do these type of ugly things . If there are no promo codes so instead of ordering food (delivery charges also) we can go to that shop and buy food , so they should give promo codes otherwise we think that they are cheating so improve.",3
"Please do not install this app !!!! Zomato is one app I have seen which doesn't even care about their customers. They have the worst ever customer care service. Recently I had placed an order which I had paid and also didn't even receive. Raised the issue to their help desk and their is still no response. I would just ask anyone who is thinking of installing this app , please prohibit this app because you will suffer a lot later on when u start using it.",1
"Worst service ever...... Three orders on zomato and they dont fulfill the objective of this platform, i would rather walk 1 hour to eat food instead of waiting 2 to 3 hours for online food delivery, the deliver guys insists you so much to cancel the order. Dont understand the reason.....i wish i could rate zero ........fraud cheater........ Still waiting for the refund for previous order.....cheaterssssssss Third classsss",1
"hello team!, I'm very very dissapointing with my first order from zomato. it was worst experience, the food that i got was not properly packed, it was placed in a single brown paper envelope only, although i gave prior delivery instruction. At the same time the food that i ordered was completely cold when it was handover to me . Really zomato must maintain quality here in meerut. And i hope such complain will be sort out in future. thats what i wanted to say. Thanks😐",1
I've ordered paneer tikka wrap. The taste was awesome and presentation of food was also nice. Defenatly recommend if someone is looking for light food.,5
only good in offers but the app is too bad. no user friendly. no solutions provided by the customer support .chat support system is very bad. nobody reply for 10 mins . just need to wait and wait for the reply.,1
"I think this is the first app which innovated the concept of rating and reviews of restaurants. Now, the concept is on fire, very few businesses have such a huge impact on the entire market's way of operations . All the best.",4
They provide very bad service even though I typed in the right address and paid for it online for a full amount of rs 477 they said that the location was wrong and sent us that our order could not be delivered and sent us a fancy email that we will be partially refunded and in the email it stated that the deducted amount was rs 477 and we will get nothing back they are just a bunch of thieves don't use zomato if u care for ur money.,1
"Bad experiance: every time i order food from zomato they always delay. Sometimes they spill food and sometimes there is nothing. Eg: If I order Pepsi with pizza, only pizza comes.This has not happened only once, it is happening again and again. Maybe i should delete this app.",1
Pleased with the service of Zomato. The app itself too runs properly. But the live tracking has been a bit faulty recently. Technical bugs I believe. Keep up the good job! Edit: The live tracking has gone worse :3,5
Delivery charges are high as compared to other competitors. Not had options doesn't mean will charge whatever wants. Some regulators agency wants to monitor with this type of arbitrariness. Delivery charges are high if bill amount is less and vice versa.,2
ZOMATO services are the best I myself is hotelier and if someone ask me what exactly are the standards of delivery and customer experience is I would say ZOMATO is a perfect example for the same. Great hospitality shown by the customer support team also. Its the best app for the delivery of food and smiles. I have tried many other applications also for the delivery of the food and in most of the apps the biggest negative point is the customer support team.,5
Fraud app. No reply or help from customer care. Very bad experience.,1
"My personal experience is that whenever i order food with a promocode then i always recieve very bad quality of food and that too not from the place that i have ordered the food. The food they deliver after applying the promocode is always very pathetic. Sometimes, they deliver it from very bad place and not from the place where i have order the food on zomato app! I will not use this service any longer. Zomato service must be banned. They are misleading people and cheating with them.",1
"Zomato being an top class in food delivering system, fulfills your all expectations. On time delivery, amazing offers and great deals...everything that's required for online delivering...but facing a problem.....mostly by 7 or 8, many restaurants stop taking orders...Is that fault in system or in my app😅Though love the app😍😍👍",4
Satisfied with the way the app has improvised and immediate response from the customer care. Absolutely user friendly. Option to search any outlet in the city is very encouraging than any other platforms.,5
"None of my orders came on time. Sometimes I had to wait for 2 hours for them to tell me ""your order wasn't accepted by the restaurant."" Although, the money was deducted from my account... I don't recommend this provider at all.",1
"I had the most terrible experience on the app, and not even refering to the fact that the food takes over hours to arrive but the fact that zomato associates behave like artificial bots with no understanding of the situation, only robotically apologizing.",1
"Your gold membership just sucks... You can't even add small update for logout from all devices even after complaining & suggesting you add that because it is hampering the privacy of my account.. But still nothing is done for it... Worst experience ever with this app... I'll never ever purchase there membership for sure. Can't even add proper updates as per suggestions & they want only positive feedbacks for the service, how selfish of you people ! Will not recommend to use there gold service.",1
"The response from app side is very bad you cannot contact any person about the missed order and you cannot complain about order, if you order it for some one at home when you are staying outside...everything is computer generated chat.",1
Very poor app. 9 days and I am still waiting for refund for a non-delivered pizza. I ordered food one week back and due to rains they could not deliver. Neither they refund my amount even after regular follow up. Pathetic!,1
"Worst experience. Ordered food and after 1 hour Zomato says it is refunding the money because delivery executives are not available. My money has not been refunded yet. Nor did they have any resolution. Your automated system is poor and your support executives are showpieces, good for nothing. Only present to offer consolation. As soon as my money gets refunded, I will uninstall this stupid application and will shift to Swiggy.",1
It has been a great experience but my only concern is that the quality of packing is not improving for gaya(Bihar). And sometimes the parcel has been open and someone eats also from that. So try to improve it for gaya location.,4
"Worst App Worst App & Worst Experience, Recommend you all not to install this app. Their is huge difference of menu price shown on app for particular Restaurant instead of Original Menu price of that Restaurant. App hanged many time & While Checking Order Most of the time Without confirmation they place order & if you cancel the same in nano seconds, still they bound u to pay the amount. No reply on customer care, chat service is so poor. Order quantity or quality not as per standard. Worst App",1
"These people are doing fake promotions of timely delivery or free. When contacted support for my order, he said there is no such option.",1
"i order from subway, didnt get order for 2 hours. chat support says we have credited 144rs for your order. then i. get message on app your order could not be and then order arrives via delivery boy he says his app shows that i REJECTED the order and then when chat support says you. may take this order as complimentory delivery, guy denies. becomes rude. i dont want to. use app and i reuest a call back to sort out my gold membership then i am being informed thats not possible. PATHETIC EXPIERIENCE",1
"yesterday i ordered mayo cheese burger and aalu paratha. it takes 1 hour to deliver & the quality of food was just horrible. i felt i wasted my money by ordering that food from this app. burger was like a simple bun not even warm, cheese and mayo was out of the burger & make whole burger wet & sticky. & the aalu paratha was worse, pathetic quality. seriously I'll never do it again.",1
"The app stuck and the next thing I saw was a random order getting placed. The very next moment I tried to cancel it, Zomato tells me that food wastage is not good and I will not be getting a refund because i already pais. Atleast be realistic about when the user has placed his/her order. There should be a time limit where I user can cancel the order in that specific time. I can wait for 45 minutes for an order, I can 5 more minutes but Zomato doesn't want to. Very well, devs.",1
"[Update: And it's already done! Keep it up devs!] My rating for the service is 5 stars. The app however can be streamlined, for example, to have brick-and-mortar options separate from online service. It seems logical for zomato to have restaurant finder natively present in the app because of their subscription service, but I as a patron am always clear whether I want to go out or order in. The two devices should be separate to help remove clutter and make the app more organized.",5
Rubbisssshhh extra delivery charges..,1
I ordered. After 50 minutes of waiting the app showed my order is on the way. However when the valet was 9 mins away my order was cancelled stating the items i ordered arent available. When I tried to follow up the customer care is of least support.,1
"Initially they give you lots of offer but once you start using this app, after few days you will realise they r decreasing the discount and one more biggest mistake of this application is that, 'food once ordered will not get cancle' even if had done it by mistake.",2
"Uber Eats was so much better than Zomato. It was easy to use. Zomato is complex and most restaurant which offered on Uber Eats don't offer consistently on Zomato. Takes too long to order, it's mentally draining for a hungry person, which makes the experience even worse.",1
"Have ordered using zomato at 9:45 delivery time was 10:30, haven't received the order i was asking on zomato chat for help, but nobody was responding after waiting till 11pm and give up. In morning i see notification of delivery at 1:30 am and asking for feedback. Now they are saying it was delivered to you. And you raising request late. In addition to that everytime i raise issue their zomato executive keep on asking me irrelevant questions and keep pasting them",1
"The rates on which the discounts are being offered have been kept much higher than the original restaurant rates and so, even after applying the discount coupon, the final price is higher than the cost in the restaurant menu... Cheating the customers.",1
"Most third class application. Zomato have made food ordering experience worst or I should say just because of zomato all restaurants delivery have become worst. Most of the time either less food or wrong foods been delivered, than you keep calling the restaurants number which are always unreachable. You contact Zomato customer support and you keep waiting for their replies for next two hours. We have always ordered food directly from restaurants and never ever had such terrible experiences.",1
"Person didnt contact me, infact i called him many times, poor experience with the after explaining ,Board displays every thing",1
Mr Sailadhar Borgohain was very good in his duties.,5
"unable to edit my profile in new zomato app... there is no option for this... please update... also with ner user interface its very hard to find out resturant reviews... all you can do is to look at the menu restaurant offering and order from that... c'mon zomato,, i wanna see resturent ambiance, sitting and customer's review... how can i,,, where is old zomato..???",1
This app shows that they have offer running that delivery charge is free and then they add delivery charge and hide it in taxes portion. No discount,1
these app is awesome except one thing if you select one dish from a restaurant and go back select another item from another restaurant then first one is removed from cart. it means you can't select two different item from two different restaurant so you should fix these.,4
"Horrible application, dont ever order from it, we faced incidents that had missing food and talked to the costumer service and they replied that they will fix issues and then they dont fix anything, they are frauds and liars. Dont download the app.",1
"a much needed app for someone living alone and a job. The food is good and on time, and ordering with this app is super easy. Just one little thing, there are some food places that aren't included in the list. Try to add more restaurants please😇😋",5
Swiggy is way better than zoomato. First of all base prices are higher than the original ones. Yes I am ready to pay delivery charges but atlest base prices should be correct. I understand you have to make profit but fooling the customers into believing that a lassi cost 80 bucks is absurd when tge original cost is 30. Thats why I have stopped using it.,1
app is too slow. Restaurents denying orders after the payment. Quantity of food is not mentioned. rating of restaurents is not mentioned on all pages. distance of restaurents is not mentioned on all pages. p.s. note - zomato app neads lot of improvement .,1
previous order was cancelled due to inability of restaurant timing and unavailable ordered items. If full amount was to pe penalised any customer would get whatever available in stead of cancellation. Swiggy account is running for months without any issues. Thus I expect previous penalty to be reviewed and waived to enable avail services pls.,1
i wanted to rate it 0 starsMy experience: today i ordered 3 pizzas from zomato Yes it was my mistake that i forgot to apply promocode. but within seconds i called the rider to cancel my order then i went in chat section there was one minute wait time that time was wasted by them not me then i asked them to cancel the order i even called them but no they said order is ready you have to pay or you will pay penalty i am not going to order anything in future so no penalty.even food they sell is stale,1
"I opted for a contact less delivery ... What I got was a food package that was open and all the rice and sabji was out in the delivery agents bag. ""Contact less delivery "" what a joke ... If this is happening in front of us I can only imagine what is happening behind the scenes. Anyhow I asked him to take it back to which he said the restaurant was closed ... And threw the food in bin out side my house. Might wanna reconsider ordering from them in times of covid19",1
don't use this app... location wrong address pinned so we are only go for collecting food at zomotto pinned location try other food delivery application for get food faster on your location. zomotto does not have call support... rider support person told two opinion for get food 1. u come to pinned location 2. cancel the order and told me if we are cancel the order money not refunded to us... cheating with us for delivering food...,1
"worst app ever! I ordered a cake for my party. I recieved the spilled package and with that a wrong cake... and then when i ask them to refund my money they said that we cant its against our policy... Dont use this app and dont advise your friends and family to use it... worst experience, never had such bad experience with food panda and swiggy... Dont use this app... If there was a option i would have given a zero to this app...",1
Works well customer service is good and delivery is on time,5
Fast and easy to use. Lots of good food options . Ratings help in deciding what to expect. Good for every budget. GOLD membership is really good. Festival offers and other occasional offers help in keeping the price down from what is in menus. Fast tracking of ordered food . Zomato just need to check a little on refund issues and processes. Good app. Very handy.,5
"Worst food app ever. The delivery guy says that my order is delivered and he left it on my doorstep without even ringing my doorbell or calling me to inform. He just left it there like that and didn't bother to inform me. And guess what I haven't received any parcel, there was nothing on my doorstep and your executives are not even ready to refund or get my order delivered.",1
Excellent app and very easy to operate. virtually most of the top restaurants are available. Service is very good. To be honest its hunger emergency button. If hungry and no option press zomato on mobile. Easy to track ur order also. Have been using for quite some time now. Thanks Zomato,5
"this is really good,runs smoothly .offers a great discount even in off restaurants also.great innovative move by zomato .now its became easier to taste by seating in your home instead of waiting hours in your fav. restaurant. time saving .",4
Very poor service. The chat process is very bad and how someone can select the options they have provided. There might be some other issues also. Whatever the time they take to deliver they will keep it as ontime delivery only,2
"ZOMATO does misleading advertising saying opt in for on time or free, my order was for 656 odd INR and our came around 5 minutes late. They gave me a 200 INR promo for delivering it late instead of giving me my order free as they keep advertising in their opt in for ""On time or Free"" marketing on the app. This is extremely misleading and very unbecoming of a brand like ZOMATO.",1
"i ordered item from zomato easy section.. it was showing there green mark but it had a differnt taste so i checked it in detail and i found, it actually contains eggs... i am pure vegetarian person and it is shrawan month and i ate egg.. this is really irresponsible thing.. u people need to take some serious action about it.. this about someones lifetime faith n relegion..",1
Worst experience. 1220 rs pending as refund for more than 3 weeks now. No help proper help received. Wrong order every other day. Irresponsible agents taking more than 10mins to give any response. This is probably the last time I am using this app.,1
"good app, but it is very difficult to report an issue.... i ordered cake for my grandfather's birthday and found a strand of hair in it, i complained but no body helped. anyways i have been using the app for quite some time and its pretty decent.",3
"The available promo codes should be displayed at the time of checkout. Because at times the user may not know what promo codes are available, and consequently he/she may fail to get discounts.",4
I ordered by mistake it doesn't not prompt to payment page and order directly in same items page only They charged me for cancelled order they must inform about the cancellation time if they have informed I would have taken it i called several times and chat they never informed about cancellation penalty etc in chat or call and charged at the end they simply sent a message and saying that I have not lifted call,1
The most unsatisfactory thing about zomato is their customer support. No one replies in an instant and there is not even a contact no to connect if the issue is not resolved. Otherwise I would have rated it 5.,4
"Easy to use and decent options but...it has happened a 2nd time now that my order was never confirmed and after waiting for about 30 minutes for Zomato to call the restaurant, i tried initiating Zomato chat support only to wait again for another 20 mins...no response.",3
always something is missing. today it was fries and coke. no option to call customer support. chat is a series of automated questions which ask about the item missing without any way to communicate that some sides are missing. no way to type. insane kind of support,1
Horrible experience. It charges you for their mistake and doesn't refund if the delivery is not made. Charges a high delivery charge. Delivery boys do not know how to talk to customers. Worst service ever.,1
App is good but the online payment is having problems. I want to say that the card payment is poor because have a lot of time for payment. So improve the card payment method. Thank you.,3
"Completely lost the trust and the respect you guys earned with the worst service ever.. food was ordered and then status was like food is being prepared and after 45min wait they simply update the status saying the order got cancelled due to some technical issues?? is that way it is and money will be returned in some working days and the wait for wat we have done.. is like in vein. seriously if you guys cannot deliver then why to accept the order,loosing a valuable customer is loosing business.",1
This is the worst app ever.... Part of my order was missing 7 days back and they promised me to give me the refund for the same... Since then I'm complaining everyday but no one is listening....I haven't got any refund... Customer service is totally useless.... Or there is no customer service,1
its really good but quantity (weight) should be same when we take in restaurant or shop it has been observed that some restaurans are cheating in zomato app by giving lesser weight which is not correct and in the same manner simply some restaurants are giving outdated and non hygenic food these things may effect Zomato credibility so kindly observed it farooq shubli muhammed,4
"Pathetic service delivery. First, they changed the order and I had to choose an item of lower price. On top of it, I had to personnaly go to the restaurant to collect my order because Zomato guys were not delivering the order. In the end, they did not even refund the balance amount.",3
"worst customer service and these people are cheating customers, I orders same item from same restaurant but the quality of item is different when it come to online order. please don't go for promotional offers they are playing with customers also if we have any issue they Really not responding in given time nor after that. I don't recommend this Zomato.",1
"The customer service is very pathetic as there is no one to provide the solution of you are facing any issues with your order even they don't give you any refund in case your order is bad(faul smell, spill over, not delivered). This is how they claim best app for food delivery all fake N most of the reviews are posted by their own employees",1
Zomato has made my life so easy. I order from here three to four times in a week and their service is amazing. Whether it is the timings or the people delivering the food - everything is great.,5
"very disappointed. I keep getting calls from your customer care to a point that it's so annoying and your food is over priced when compared to the actual menu or the menu from other food delivery apps, Please don't think all the customers are stupid enough to not notice that. Horrible experience",1
"NEVER SEEN SUCH WORST APP. Still no change in Zomata,,,,, I mail about my issues, it has been 72 hrs, still no response, my unquie id 837109. One star is also waste , such stupid app, no one will responding for , problem issued. *Worst food application . , i ordered hot and spicy food, but food reach is Cool and yesterdays 0.0000001 star should be given to this application.,",1
Food is everything for me and thanx for helping me with that☺️🤩🤩☺️🤩,5
"Great experience. Though delivery of certain restaurants is not provided in close vicinity, but in farther areas.. please look into it. Its funny to be able to get food from a place if u far off but not if u r close to it 😂",5
Awesome app for food ordering. Sometimes they give so exciting offers that you can't resist yourself from ordering. Overall they care about your complaints. The Delivery boys are also very fast and punctual.,4
Very bad customer support and it funny thing is that it'll keep on happening. So many times have to wait doe order but still won't receive cause we have paid online and the money also gets stuck. Don't recommend this app to anyone.,1
Within seconds they increase their service charge to more than double. Fraud and dishonest people,1
one of the worst customer service i face at the start they wr good but as it is getting older customer support services is going worst. As i have made an order online and made payment online only using my wallet but still after all that it says payment incomplete and on customer chat they dont reply. one of most imp thing about this app is that it takes 2 hrs to get order delivered to you,1
"There's are no such thing like customer care. You can't explain your problem or issue to a robot chat box. And please dont talk about the live tracking. Many times I got my order but in app it still shows.. . ""Your order is on the way"" .. .. 🤣",1
"the old format was so much better. it was simple, legible and easy to use. But after this stupid update it's just become unnecessarily cluttered, inconvenient to use and aesthetically very unpleasing. please go back to the old format. life was just easier back then. please",1
"Sometimes there are a few problems in terms of late or no delivery, however Zomato does compensate for it to it's customers, so that's a nice quality. And coupons are great!",4
"Non-sense service, made me wait for 2 hours and still they are not sure when the order will be delivered. They just know to say that refund will be made, refund is what I get for waiting and being hungry all that long. Disgraceful!",1
Wonderful experience... Food in minutes. Servicing is good. Delivery is on time. I had ordered many times but no issues. Am satisfied using this app. I'll insist my friends & others who need a good food as convince..... 😍,5
"App is having some serious issue.After the delivery boy reaches my location and calls me.I don't get the call but the person hears ring.Two times I ordered, every time I faced same thing.When I saw that the person is at my location and called him.Then I could get the order otherwise the person was going to cancel it.This needs to be improved.Also delivery boy's vehicle number should be shared so that we can recognize him.",2
"Spoke to the valet. He said he has been having trouble using the zomato app. It hangs too much hence customers can't contact them via phone call. I personally have had my order cancelled due to this. Every time I call the valet, the phone remains busy.",1
Basically cheaters. Will promise something and will do something else. If you complain then will ask you to compensate by something that you don't want. After that they will ask for feedback where they have enabled only like button. So if you are not satisfied you can't show that in feedback amazing cheeters,1
"I m call 1min before my oder for cancelling but zomato reply I am sorry, I will not be able to cancel the order as per our policy. Once the order has been accepted by the restaurant, details are immediately sent to the kitchen and preparation begins. Cancelling the order post preparation leads to wastage and hence I will not be able to proceed with your request .. When I call delivery boy ..and he say my oder will come after 2hour ..I m not satisfied",1
"Its always been the good experience with zomato, the delivery time is made shorter then previous experiences ...which is great! The best part is the night kitchen options for which zomato has included many options...which ensure to get food of my taste buds even late at night. being a foody guy myself i always go with zomato Thanks",5
"Your customer support sucks when it comes to order modification (when it is not dispatched) and refund process. Swiggy is much better in these areas. To add on, showing up all the restaurants in the city even when I want to order online is irritating!!",1
Very nice food app among it's competitors. It shows more restaurants than any another app in my area(very few shops are there in my area). It ensures to deliver with minimal delivery charges and offers are great!,5
"too slow delivery, very bad experience with this. always their delivery deliver 2 or more deliveries at the same time so that they take more time to deliver. it's good if you have more than 1 hour to wait.",1
"Customer service needs to be improve a lot. I got low quality food from one of restaurant , which I immediately raised complaint to zomato . Even after 7 days no proper response. Very disappointed service.or else app is very good and user friendly and very fast delivery.",4
"Why are youll asking location permission?It's already given!Work on developing your app rather than on the annoying pop-ups for location permission.Zomato service not organised, dont have updates from restaurant, delivery time is never true.They dont have a complaints dept to hear ur grievences.Zomato is at the mercy of restaurants & delivery person.Not a trustworthy organization if ur relying on their service.",1
"Don't order from here.zomato doesn't look for customer satisfaction.i ordered a cake from Mambo's recipe and the delivered in dirty way without following the instruction and with worst handwriting.when I went for customer support,so step was taken against it.",1
"poor app. after one hour of ordering , food was shown as being prepared. one should never pay in advance on this app as they deduct money on cancellation and take no responsibility for delayed order. better avoid the app or chose pay on delivery.",1
"You can meet a friend here. Or if you wanna have someone who you can be with for a food adventure. Perfect for the people who love to go to restaurant and take a picture. In short, this is highly recommended to food bloggers! 😊",4
"Very bad service, I wanted to order a burger and it said that the order was declined due to insufficient things and when I went to another restaurant to check that one also said insufficient things, I tried 8 restaurants and non of them worked.",1
App has an area of improvement. Menu has submenu Inside the main dish. App allows to select the submenu but do not allow to select the quantity. So your order may not be sufficient to user need. If interested call me. Will explain.,3
Couldn't load the app after new update. Tried uninstalling. But still cant reinstall. Zomato please do something for us hungry people.,1
"It has been useful for my lazy time when I really don't feel like going out to eat. Some of the restaurant that I like is also available in here so, I don't get disapointed for taste and qualities as I have been there.",4
Very poor service,1
Yes it's a wonderful app to place an order but when it comes to refund then please forget about it. They will say in there policy there is no such refund policy after cancellation even if a customer had placed an ordered again. Wonderful services provided by you ZOMATO,1
Good food and fast delivery,5
Poorest app and service by zomato. They don't even know how to make a proper app. Their app is not even able to detect the location and detects a location 6kms away from the house and in spite of giving correct address they say that u need to come at their location to collect order even after getting biller for delivery charges.,1
"Today I had ordered from a restaurant ,and the delivery location was set wrong by Zomato map,the delivery guy waited for just 3-4mins and when I gave the phone no. of person to be contacted and still they are charging penalty fee etc. I would not recommend everyone about Zomato to anyone about ordering ,as money is not transferrable once paid ,when ur order gets cancelled",1
The menu in the hotel and zomatos menu are different. Zomato give coupons but steals on different menu price and taxes and still the bill is more than hotel price. Swiggy is better than zomato. I ordered some food which had rotten onions and chicken peices stolen and package open. I complained to zomato they came back with we dont control food packing or cooking. Swiggy is 10 times better.,1
"very good experience, but some times the restaurants do not deliver the actual quantity and quantity of the food but in that case if you write your experience to zomato then zomato will solve take care of that. My experience about zomato is - this company is very much serious about customer satisfaction. Thanks and try your TESTE buds through ZOMATO.",5
The food was delivered before time which is good however the app did not provide a proper ETA for delivery since it kept saying that the food will be delivered exactly when I ordered. I would much prefer a verbal conversation directly with the vendor.,2
very bad experience happening to me by zomato. its taking so much delay for food delivery. in that case swiggy is better. theres no customer service contact number providing. in case of chat no reply. still now im waiting for my order for more than one and a half hours.,1
Horrible approach to customers. Wont even refund the amount fir the items they failed to deliver. They don't ahve customer care service at all. With their stupid bot responses on chat u can't even get to customer care actual human being to try get a refund for the order that was cancelled. Lost 700 bucks worth of order. Never order through zomato Cannot be trusted to expect a service .,1
Great app. Choices are local that is great things to me. I personally go for lunch dinner so easy to find out. I like most is local hotels and restaurants. That is plus point of zomato.,5
Zomato has made ordering food very convenient. Even during the lock down phase zomato has its operations running so that people get necessary food delivered directly from restaurant kitchens. Kudos to the delivery team as well for working this hard and ensuring a good level of customer service.,5
This is an amazing food delivery app it's a delight for or us working from anywhere and want to get lunch dinner without having to go out as of now I don't have any compliments with Zomato except I want to mention that there were few times that the food quality was really not up to the mark but Zomato help me with it .Thanks Zomato ❤️❤️,5
"What happened to the app? I've always relied on this whenever i need to check out a menu or a place to eat but ever since the update it can't find me specific dishes not even the normal ""American"" or ""Korean"" cuisines? The locatio is also weird and my GPS is on. Please fix this Zomato.",3
Nice experience from zomato service but not from restaurant,5
"for cancelled order , they will charge full order value. it the policy of zomato to charge full amount if the order was cancelled. great . Also their charges are much higher than other food delivery apps , and their services are zero.",1
I don't want to give even single star also... Very worst experience with this Zomota app... Simply Zomota people will cancel our orders and will not refund the amount immediately even if they cancelled by them because of their service mistake or improper confirmation from hotel selected... Even if u want to go Zomota Please don't pay through online because refund in Zomota is not very easy... Very bad customer service people will talk to you harshly even if theirs mistake....,1
Good Job I got my order with in 19 min. Thanks Zomato,5
"In this week , I faced so many issues with zomato that I am not going to use this app again . Providing wrong items , missing items , cold food , missing add-ons ...just too much. Refunds are not coming. None is taking proper steps. None is bothered at all. Shame!!",2
"It will keep updating your delivery time, like they'll start with around 30 minutes, and then when 15-20 minutes pass, they'll still show 25 minutes left. I have been a Gold member of zomato, but the way zomato deliver its customer service, it's terrible.",1
"Worst delivery service ever. No way to contact them except chat, which no one replied to. It took them 1.5 hours to deliver an order of an appetizer, even after promising a Max 1 hour waiting time. Pathetic service. Won't order from them again!",1
Great app really easy to use and delivery is quick too,5
worst app ever the delivery boys were such rude to the customers that they don't deliver the order to the location instead they tell the customer to come near them.... And the service of this app is worst. Do not download this app such a worst..... Swiggy is much better than this. My suggestion to all is not to download this app,1
"Worst unsecured app. While making the order there is no OTP confirmation before payment, money is directly deducted. Customer service is bad, not helpful. App is not secured when it comes to the digital payment. Wish I could give ""0"" star.",1
"I wish I could give them less than half a star. Absolutely pathetic customer service and they resort to misrepresenting delivery times and ratings to get you to order. After you've paid, they hold you to ransom and make the lamest of excuses. Only had enough time to write this, else would take them to consumer court. Also, still hungry because of how irresponsible and shameless they are",1
I had order something made payment also.. After some time I had cancelled order.. I was in travelling.. Didn't able to read instructions properly. I had requested to refund my money.. They no as per policy we could able to refund ur money.. This is how cheated with me... Fraud zomatto.. I I'll share this story to all.. Do not keep relation with zomatto they even not ready refund 235 rs..,1
Don't do pay ments from this app. Do cash on delivery only. Or else they take both your cash and your food. And on top if that they charge you a cancellation fee. So that when you complain then they can say that your order got cancelled cuz your phone is unreachable. So it's on me.,1
"Pathetic service, the food preparation begins with in 30 secs of your order booking that's what they state. In real they take hours to deliver. Offers button will be somewhere in the corner just to hide. Will never return back",1
"Extremely disappointed with the service.I had placed two orders from the same restaurant.One was delivered but the other was not given to me and yet marked as delivered.On calling the rider, the restaurant as well as Zomato, no one responded adequately.And finally after 2 hours they cancelled the order because of lack of coordination at their end.Their standards have decreased horribly.If you want to order food, wait for 2 hours ( and spend those two hours in making futile calls to Zomato) and finally have your order cancelled by Zomato without asking you,then Zomato is the right app for you!",1
"I have experienced worst order and delivery service, also food is never on time and if the food is cash on delivery then the valet also delivers your order to other customers, how irresponsible of them for this, and the end time cancellation acts as an icing on the cake, literally had very bad experiences with zomato since some days.",1
"One of the best food delivery app. I've using Zomato since so long and I'd never faced any issue, even if I get a food not well cooked, Zomato had refunded me my money back. And also the customer service was great all the time... Just love this app ...😍",5
Worst experience ever.. I have ordered a cake almost 5 days back from this app but then the delivery boy didn't sended it on the right place nd said there's a problem in the maps so I cancelled the order but it's been 5 days and I didn't got my money back the app said they will return my money in 2 to 4 days and it's been 6 days.,1
I have order food and i got hairs in the food amd they r not refunding my money also very bad app,1
Very useful.... Great...,5
"very very poor app & their services. They dont deliver the proper food which a person ordered. I am very much disappointed that they dont even reply my queries. Moreover the chat option with the zomato guys isnt working at all, writing tab is missing. Very unprofessional.",1
"Today when I placed my order I've selected my home address and this order was prepaid order, and whendelivery agent called me and asked for the address hence as per mentioned address on the order,  I've confirmed the same and delivery agent told he won't be able to deliver as the GPS location showing wrong add. When I've already mentioned my complete address with the pin code and If the GPS is shoering wrong address is this my fault This people didn't deliver the order and didn't refund my money",1
no consistency in between different phones placing the same order from the same restraunt... on one phone the rate of the dish is greater than that of the other phone dilevery charge changes from phone to phone even when delivery address is the same from tge same restuarant also they dont allow to use coupon codes continuously disappointed with the app experience,1
"Very bad, you order from some good restorent of city, they will deliver it from some road side food vender",1
"This app is totally fraud. I ordered food for myself which was accepted by the restaurant, but at delivering time the delivery boy canceled the the order at my door step without calling me. But when it was too late from the time I placed the order, I've found the delivery boy canceled the order by himself. I informed to restaurant about this matter. But now when I tring to place another order this app wants me to pay for the cancellation charge. why should I pay for this, where that boy canceled",1
"Previous one was better.....by the tym u r adding items to ur cart nd final ur order, you get a currently not accepting order....this doesn't show that any restaurant isn't accepting orders on the wall.....bt after you make sure to order from the restaurant or make the order final it's not accepting.... please update ur app nd make changes for ur customers to use it easily.",2
i had the worst experience with zomato. They cancelled my order twice whice both were prepaid and i didn't get the refund for the same. I called zomato several times but the customer care agents are least helpful. The restaurant will blame the valet for cancelling the order and the valet in turn blame zomato for the same. I am just so disappointed with zomato. AND STILL I DID NOT GET BACK MY REFUND AMOUNT.,1
Bad Experience. When the order was cancelled they will just send automated messages like it was nothing. I dont know how long will it take for their refund process. A complete waste of time and effort. 😡,1
where is the ratings! there used to be ratings for last seven orders given by other customers of the restaurant where we are ordering. but it's not there now. so bring that feature back.,3
"Very bad delivery , if Zomato is not able to deliver order within given time then they add more minutes to delivery time and makes us fool and therefore they donot need to give food for free... Addvertisement are lie making fool of us . Delivery took 1 & 1/2 hour. Very disappointing and seriously very bad service",1
"Zomato is my second kitchen when it comes to food. I am gold m3mber since last 8 months. I am sorry to say that despite being one of best food app in India, the app is not opening since last 10 days. When I click on the icon nothing happens but a black screen and then a notification that app have stopped working.I have uninstalled it, cleared cache memory but the app still crashes. Hope this message reach to Development team and fix the bug soon. Till than I am on Swiggy now.",1
"Even after giving the instructions while placing order , this restaurant delivered food incorrectly and not as per requirement. When spoke to the manager , he started fighting and said instructions do not matter on the order. Never going to order from here again. Worst experience by Zomato as well as they said we can't do anything about it.",1
"Restaurant list is very good. But in some locations deliveries are not available, even in the big city like vadodara. So that improvement is necessary. Other delivery services is good.",4
When we order food they pick from road side stalls and send us low quality foods. Even they didn't hesitate in sending the spoiled food. I never got fresh food from zomato. When I raise query they take very long to reply and if i fail to reply them within a minute they close the chat session. That's why they didn't provide call support. They never refund money and says they are having conversation with the restaurant. My personal experience : Zomato is totally fraud. Swiggy is much more better.,1
"Worst experience with this food delivery company. I hadn't gotten any calls from the delivery agent within the estimated delivery time and since I had a flight I had to make a move. I reached out to the delivery agent first since I did not get any calls from him and Zomato charged me a cancellation fee because they claim that I was unresponsive to ther calls ""which were never made"" . It is because of the inefficiency in their system that they fraudulently claim funds from their customers.",1
Pathetic App! I placed an order twice & it was declined. Money was sent to my Zomato wallet. I called the restaurant and they called Zomato. Zomato guys told to uninstall the app and place the order again but same thing happened again. I was successful when I tried for the 4th time with Dominos. Really bad experience with Zomato.,1
I ordered food and the order gets automatically cancelled stating that the area is not covered neither they refunded very bad service...,1
"What is this behaviour!!!! I just logged out and logged in again with the same account and all that coupoun of zomato 30,40,50%off on selected resturants are vanished and i am not able to get a discount and i know that zomato had more price than the original ones in hotel so why should i pay so high",1
App is good and the service also..but dont expect much if there is any problem with the quantity or quality. They say that they are opening the complaint but thats all fake. So giving 3 stars,3
"I paid zomato gold and now the app. is all about food delivery, keeps going there on opening . Deep links to see the menu don't work anymore, it's so difficult to search for a restaurant review. Disappointed.",1
"Good food delivery service app. Items aren't well categorized in the menu so you have to scroll through the entire menu even if you don't want to, so there's room for UX improvement. They could add more restaurants to the service.",4
Worst delivery service. I could not imagine what kind of app zomato it is. I ordered from nearby restaurant which is less than half km from my home. Valet is assigned and he is delivering another order before me which is somewhere 5 km away then delivering to me. This is not what is expected from you zomato,1
"it's a third grade app and service providers, they don't care about their customers. They are filthy and would never provode you with a solution and their concerned team(escalation team) would never get back to you. You will have to plead for your own money to get into your account. This company is a cheat and is earning money as a commission on every order which they don't let you have as a refund, even though the food is stale and barely cooked. I would want to rate them in negative.",1
Can't reach Zomato support,1
Why don't you guys add liqour option online? It would be better during this covid. Summer & Beer! Wallah!,3
The support service is bad. I am stopping my food ordering here. Swiggy is way better in service and resolution. I ordered 2 plates of idli sambar and chutney for breakfast from eat.fit. They sent only sambar and chutney . No idlis! The delivery guy said he had asked the restaurant same question before taking the order and they replied saying this is what has been ordered. There is no support also from Zomato. This is outright cheating,1
"In last 1 month, Zomato's service has gone down to 1 star from being on 5 star, worst service. Every single time, there is one or another issue with the order and on top of that, nobody responds on time in Zomato Support. I was a loyal customer, but I'm gonna stop using Zomato. Its not dependable anymore.",1
The GPS and estimates provided on food delivery time is absolutely useless on this app. It's a headache to deal with and only using this app for those rare orders other providers don't. Soon they will and this app will be redunded.,1
reliable and convenient. I'm thankful for these services in my city. Makes ordering food so much easier when going outside is not an option or when feeling too lazy to step out.,5
"No zero to rate, i recommend not to use this app. I had very bad experience on new year, Food i got was tasteless and spoiled. I tried to contact them but they are least bothered and gave very smart answers. Infact they indirectly said me, once they deliver food, they are not responsible for food spoiled or not tasty etc..",1
I gave delivery instructions with in one minute of। my order but it was not followed and I was told that I can cancel my order with full charge ..... does Zomato think their customers are fools or what .... I would rather not take your services .... I would rather call the restaurant or will go and pick food myself .... actually we have unnecessarily given undue weightage to companies like Zomato.... we should stop this Good bye and Good night,1
"Worst food delivery app out there. Ordered food for the first time at 9:15pm on this app. after the pick up food came more than an hour late 11:05pm, the rider was drunk and disturbed atleast three houses in my neighbourhood saying that he doesn't have my phone number. Never going to use this app again. Also customer care made me wait for 40 mins thus writting this review.",1
Food supplied was at least three days old,1
"App usability is good. however there's issue some times with the delivery. Delayed delivery, missing items and wrong delivery of the food items are some of the common issues faced while ordering online food through this app.",3
"Worst support service for delivery. Only chat support and that too those guys are never helpful. If you ask them about about and customer care number they will say they don't have. Out of past 5 orders, 4 were goofed up and never delivered by these guys. The phone number that these guys display on website is never picked up. Totally worst service and experience. Lot better service is of Swiggy.",1
Request you guys to add a feature where the order is closed only upon a dual confirmation one from the customer's end and the other from the riders end as there have been instances where paid food is delivered at wrong address creating a trouble for both. The feature would require the customer to provide confirmation at the time delivery in front of the delivery guy #charteredaccountantviews #grcs #internalaudit #kpmg,3
PATHETIC SERVICE!! After waiting for an hour that too post me contacting the chat I am told that my order is cancelled and being refunded. It's the not the matter of refunds. I had ordered my dinner to eat and at night 11.30 I am told my order is cancelled. The chat support person is informing me to order from different restaurant. So you mean I order from another restaurant and wait for another 1 hour. Ordered for the first time only because UBER EATS was offline and this is the experience. Pathetic. If the restaurant was closed why the hell was my order accepted.,1
Still need to improve... They take too much time to deliver the food... N some time give wrong order.. Sometimes they will call n tell food Which we ordered is not available... N gave whatever they want.. Don't even give completely for that ... Sometimes good service...,3
Very bad app.. They show restaurants that are not nearby... And then their agents show tantrums to deliver food to ur address.. The payment was done nd i have not received the refund yet.. Its been more than 10 days.. Worst app.. Will never gonna use it again 😠😠😠,1
"worst service..there is no cancellation policy,if a person orders something by mistake or forgot to apply the promocode there should be a certain timelimit in which you can cancel your order without penalty.. seriously these cheap tricks!!!!!!!!!",1
worst App....i had placed an order and after some time the delivery boy call me to say that the meal is unavailable so you can something else or cancel the order i denied and aftersome time a call came from the company that rder was cancelled so you have to pay its amount with the next order i want to say that if the meal was not prepared so why i would pay for it,1
"whenever i want to use Zomato from my browser it asked to download the app only then i can order, my phone doesn't have much memory so i have to uninstall some of my important apps to download zomato, you should learn from Domino's or swiggy they are customer friendly no matter what which platform you use app or Mobil browser they will take your order they don't force customer to download the app but Zomato is forcing to download the app that is not good and i am not happy with this :(",1
Very Nice app . I will prefer you all to use this. BETTER than all food ordering apps,5
"Utter waste customer service experience. Not refunding the amount. Better to go with swiggy or Uber eats. Swiggy has a better Customer care service they can solve issues within minutes. In Zomato it's been 2 days and they are saying it's under process, for transferring the amount into Zomato Credit.",1
It's great experience for me every time when I order on ZOMATO. But sometimes it's difficult to understand your discount coupon codes. But anyways it's great delivery app.,4
"Totally unsatisfied with the service...after chatting with zomato they told me to send the mail and i have sent the mail but i didn't got the reply even after 4 days. So, this is not the service which anyone can expect. Frustrating experience.",1
This is really getting worst... Whenever we are in need either the owner doesn't prepare or the delivery boys don't pick.. They are giving no training... Getting idea and opening a business is one thing... If you can't cater to services... Please do not come into the market... Food is something which is required on time... If you can't understand this.. Shut your business and sit at home,1
"Zomato has come long way now, it is one of the best delivery service ... much better than Swiggy",5
"My order didn't reach me. Suddenly after 3 hours I see on the app that it has been delivered, I don't know how. I was in touch with the Helpdesk and asked for refund and complaint procedure but was denied both. What a waste of time and money",1
"Offers shown by them are fake, go to the restaurant see zomato is charging very high price than actual on every food item, also their packaging and delivery charges gone very high, you will find out that -""taking a cab both ways and eating in the restaurant is less expensive than 60% discount on zomato and u can enjoy warm fresh food""-.",1
My order was declined and was not refunded back!! N now that order is missing from the recent order list. Not trustworthy. And the challenge they pose of within 39min is all fake!! They start timer when it's cooked and not when it is ordered..,1
Zomato SUCKS!! They try their best that your order gets cancelled after acceptance and then they levy your account with a cancellation fee. Somtimes their delivery boys do not deliver food or somtimes their partner restaurants do not have the item ordered and cancel the order. They make sure you get the worst service everytime. Don't ever order from Zomato guys. There had been so many complaints in the past but their poor service continues. Go with Swiggy or Uber eats but never ever with Zomato.,1
Very bad experience. I ordered a Rs120 dish and the quantity was too less. The new version of the app also makes it very hard to convey the problems. This is too bad. Very bad service.,1
"Bad service, delivery boy doesn't bother to inform if the order is cancelled, they give lame excuses, refund process takes time. When you put the cart in the food price is different from the one when you process it. Horrible service.",1
"Overall good experience with Zomato. Good choice of cuisine and restaurants. Timely delivery, lots of offers and discounts. Only 1 downside -- food cannot be ordered from restaurants that are farther than 7-8 Km. Zomato should provide this option if customer is willing to pay more for delivery.",4
Really using zomato we are enjoying a great experience... and the delivery speed is faster and the quality of food is very good. Hope it continues the same flow in future with further developments!!!,5
"The app doesn't display the place where the restaurant is located. There are so many branches for a restaurant and if we don't know on which branch we're searching for food, how can we order ? That's a minimum feature the app should have.",1
"The things are not at all clear in this App for a New user. After entering the promo code several times also it is not getting Applied. No customer care call center available to resolve any issue or to ask any query, Only chat system available",1
"Very bad customer support, and I had to chat with the customer service about delivering the food. Also I didn't get the food. I had to spend more time with chatting with the customer service. They will reply only after 15 minutes after each message has been sent. I ignored my money.",1
The App was good earlier but the recent update has made it less user freidnly and more complicated as most of the hotels are not been searched even when they are linked with zomato. Reviews are not available on the screen. Everytime to find a particular place need to search it on Google and later it switches to the app The app itself does not finds the place directly You people need to work on it or need to go back to the older version,1
"Everything is ok except for the wrong delivery time mentioned for the restaurents as it always takes more than that. Moreover when you try to connect to customer service, you always get a reply after 5-10 minutes l, for every query 🤦🏻‍♂️",1
"I downloaded the app an hour ago and there's so much trouble in this app. The delivery page and all other page aren't loading, thought I refreshed the app lot of times and it's very upsetting. Now the zomato help guidelines are asking me to reinstall the app again. Disgusted!",1
"keeps crashing and crashing and crashing keeps showing ""something went wrong""!!!! great job guys! you load-balancers had 1 thing to do.. keep the app running. but no!! trying to order from last 30 mins but it keeps showing ""well be back soon"" i think ""tumhara code phatt gya"" *slow claps* for u guys!",1
App is should be fast...delivery is perfect no any issue... but zomato app is very slow ...and not shows hotels address...its difficulty to order...bcoz we know better which hotels makes tasty ...but in zomato app no choice freedom for order...not shows addresses at all that is the big problem,3
"None of the dishes have detailed description...many times its not a good surprise to find out the dish after opening the box...in terms of its size, accompaniments, ingredients etc. Restaurents also do not read the cooking instructions.",3
I ordered by mistake and paytm directly done as Paytm was linked but at that moment I canceled ordered. I asked for refund and you said as you canceled order you have to pay penalty and it was 100% worth 170rs I was out of as hotelier didn't received order and not packed meal and you were saying food will be wastage so we will charge 100% (170rs ). This is not right way of making money and you gonna pay for this remember.,1
"very bad customer service and not getting any update for 2hrs after ordering the food. you guys have to be kidding. we are not just playing or chilling out here. when you guys commit to something make sure you do it. today, it has been a terrible experience twice for me. almost waiting for 2hrs just for a single order which is really really pathetic. they are just giving offers to cheat us and they make us wait for more than an hour. i really regret for choosing this. very worst experience ever !",1
"No option to cancel the order within first two minutes. Deducted money wont be refunded but a penalty will be charged for the same. Poor service providers, orders are usually late, their valet's have been caught on camera eating clients food. what else could be worse.",1
Very poor in addressing the problems occurred from Zomato's end. No responsible personal from Zomato is accessible and the third party Customer Care behaves unreasonable as they cannot take any decisions on the basis of the situation. Better Zomato takes suggestions from the clients to fix up their software bugs to improve the service.,2
Please don't use it. They never help you .never reply you about your order.i order food from them I received my order but some items in my order not received (miss from my order).so I use online ordering help service. They simply said sorry and said will solve my problem within 48 hours.and they said Please send us email about my problem. After 2 days later I send them email from that day to till now not a single emails from them only single system generated email .after that till date no repl,1
"You should improve your cooking instructions and terms and conditions of the same . And the additional delivery and valet charges are being implemented , that's a whole new thing to see . You are charging for the delivery and then for valet also .",1
Excellent work by zomato ........specially for women in the house got some relief from kitchen work item.....loved it...no worries abt shopping thn cooking working hard n not the taste what v needed...btw zomato make it easy no need to do anything just choose n the food is at your door step🤗zomato is very beneficial to me.,5
"Very good app, and the best part is that it is available in such a remote area like mine. I can order food at 9 in morning or 11 at night.. it's so easy to use & my best buddy when i dont want to step out of my room coz of hot summer.",5
"Don't go for this app, the items they delivered was entirely different from what we order, if we inform to the zomato team they didn't even listen to us, they simply says we have crosschecked with restaurant people, they asked us to email they don't even reply, just to cheat",1
I would've given a 5 star for the old UI. The new UI is too cluttered and annoying with lots of information which is not really pleasant and easy to use. Pls switch back to old UI or improvise on it.,4
At first it was good app.. After that it get worst and worst.. I order food and they delivered me wrong food items.. And they also give me a code for promotion cos of the mistake they done but it was a fraud.. Its not working at all.. If i could give zero its so much better.. Such a worst app ever,1
Doesn't respond in chatbox,1
The worst service provider ever....i made a complaint almost a month back and they kept saying give us time give us time....they just ignore what there customers are saying..i don't get any solution to my complaint yet.... they just need money....there services are pathetic.....please do not use zomato....better to order a restaurant directly or cook at ur home itself,1
"0 stars. Since you added ""Opt On-Time Delivery"", delivery boys are not coming for normal orders. WTH!!? Now one has to pay extra 10rs for their order to be delivered in time? Lol. Sorry but no, I will not buy from Zomato at all. Other food services don't charge you extra for getting food in time. Getting food in time should be a very inherent feature, not a luxury one has to pay extra 10rs for.",1
"Worst experience, Reaction time is random. Some times it is immediate and others time it lags more than 2 min. Transactions are incomplete. Several time my money was cut from my account still it shows payment is incomplete.",1
overall zomato is good but in delivery very lazy i have ordered a item that take to much longer as my exception ...very disappointing from zomato really. my friend order same item at same restaurant and my friend got 24 minutes eariler than my item...😔😔 and also i have orderd 1kg full biryani have not got a single peice of leg peice that is a very poor service from restaurant overall i am very distributed angry etc...from zomato delivery service and wah ji wah restaurant....,1
"Found hair in my food, also shared images with the support staff. They are lack to help. Wasted my money. Wont use this app anymore. This covid period and their service.",1
"Pathetic experience, 2 hours of waiting still not arrived. No facility to call the Valet and enquire as well. Restaurant number not working as well. Will switch back to Swiggy again. At least their delivery is better and u have the option to call the delivery boy",1
"FOOLING PEOPLE !!. I ordered an item and the item was free delivery as said in the total amount section, but when the delivery came,the amount increased and they added extra charges for delivery..This is how we are being fooled by showing less amount at first and then have to pay extra charges for literally nothing..could have given 0 star if there was any option !!",1
Zomato app is superb and it works amazingly and it has many features too !! I liked 'zomato' app very very much and it is incredible app I really ❤️ loved it !!,5
very convenient to eat meals,5
"Pathetic service. Experienced a horrible paid membership called as Gold. Zero customer support, the max you can expect is a scripted statements ""Apologies for the inconvenience"". Most of the restaurant reflecting partnered as Gold have taken themselves off from Zomato and i could do nothing but be embarrassed. Most of the partner restaurants have invalid no. on Zomato. Customer support either doesn't respond or just take ages. Can't rate 0 as system does nt allow this rating.",1
"App is not user friendly. Has too many posters and videos unnecessary. Makes it complicated and time consuming to figure out how you order. Has a high delivery fee and so called "" handling fees"". Not recommended at all",1
"After cancelling a order , they didn't refund my money. And they are saying, there is 100% penalty if customer cancel the order. i want to ask why so? I have cancelled the order within a minute of placing it, even no delivery person also assigned to pick up my order. So i think there is no waste of food. Refund policy is ok, if there is waste of food or the delivery person suffers due to the cancellation.You have to give atleast a info while cancellation, that suggest there is no refund policy.",1
"Offers are good but too late delivery. They always club multiple orders and by the time good arrives, it becomes too cold and your hungry also goes off. You feel like you could have gone directly to the restaurant and had a good meal!",2
"Its good but in recent time they have increased taxes, delivery fees so sometimes it makes food more expensive than the MRP even after applying any code/offer. But overall good if you want dont want to go out and eat at a place of your choice.",4
"Worst customer support experience. Had ordered from freshmenu but it never got delivered and its been a week i did not even get my money back. Every time i contact the support team, they would just say its under process. I do not even understand why they cant track the delivery status of the order and refund the money asap. Weird. Not using the app anymore. Thank you!",1
"Its an amazing app (in COCHIN) especially during this time when social distancing is the only thing we could do to fight a disease y'all came up with the online grocery idea ...which is such a blessing for me,because none of the other apps meant for home delivery work in this area. I'm sooo sooo thankful to the ZOMATO team. 5stars from the bottom of my heart ♥",5
I was overcharged for billing online,2
"Was delivered the wrong order, rather than getting it picked up and money refunded for several minutes was only asked to share a picture when there was no way to share a picture on the chat. Moreover, the order was from Zaffran and seems as though the order delivered was old and kept.",1
very poor app...they automatically cancel order and they even don't refund your amount...they Just says that you are not reachable to our delivery boy... i have very bad experience with this app..... service of this app is just like an donkey's ass hole especially their customer care support service ....plzz don't use Zomato,1
"Pathetic experience. I have ordered from sai veg world restaurant, they accepted my order and make me wait for more than 1 hour and then after waiting so much they said SORRY THE ORDER IS CANCELLED. Really disappointed with this experience, I will never order from such app which doesn't respect their customer's time.",1
"Items don't come on time and even if it comes there are missing items for which they will not give enough credit and make you suffer in front of guests It's absolutely pathetic and they are not ready to come on call If gold customers are treated this way , I am not sure how bad others are treated",1
"Highly disappointed with the app in recent times.Once the delivery guy says that he delivered my food to some guy who was sitting under a tree near my location and lies to me that he had my order id thats why he gave him and the other i had payment discrepancy .While the money has been deducted from my account ,the app was showing that my payment was not processed.i have asked for clarification about this from the support guys but no reply came from them even after an hour.",1
"Bevarsi nan maklu offer discount anta torsodu amele full price generate madodu, thu halka galu. No ethics.",1
Worst ever experience no support from Service Team....... Uninstalled it,1
"Though I've been personally a fan of the service, the app gets more and more user unfriendly ever time the interface is updated. It's complicated, confusing and specially bad for senior users.",3
Delivery service is very poor. They are always late if your order is prepaid. Sometimes they even cancel the order after half an hour; when you are suppose to receive it. Shameless customer service..,1
The support is fake agenda only to misdirect people . I have filed many complain with photo as proof but they didn't help me in my inconvenience.They have very good plan to connect customers 1stly they provide them replacement for few new order and after that they didn't either help them/avail them cod but the interesting thing is people also don't leave they remain connected to Zomato in hope that some day they will be treated &will be easily compensated like before & thus it make 💸like that.,1
"I made an order. After 30 minutes, they canceled the order and now I don't have anything to eat. Worst food delivery app. Only good thing is promocodes. I will uninstall once the offer is over.",4
Worst food delivery app. Either the food is not delivered and marked as delivered or the items are missing. And when you question about the money paid their responses are as if they are doing favours by returning the money. Support techs are very rude in the convo. I wish i had an option to give negative rating.,1
I would never use Zomato again. They allow ONLY THREE Sauces out of several sauce options on Subway. I requested them through their asinine chat option to include all sauce options and received only three. What sort of idiotic app making process allows only three sauces out of a whole lot of sauce options to make the subway non-vegetarian salad hot and spicy as i like it. The quality control at Zomato needs to have a serious re-think on the UI as well as the ordering interface on Zomato. I am putting ONE star here so that I can post this opinion.,1
"no tracking location, info, number of rider to coordinate or understand his location. everything is text and assumptions. very late delivery by more than 1 hour 30 minutes. disgusting customer support is non response for more than 30 minutes, and still no response. overall pathetic",1
Well I am a foody and and thankful for Zomato but if delivery guys are not having location awareness than its really irritating and time consuming,2
"No guarentee of food by Zomato. All depends on the restraunt owner and once the food by the restraunt is not delivered timely or cancels the order the money is credited in the app and not to your account , that too with some expiry date. This is like not delivering a proper service and then forcing the customer to use the app again to use the money before expiry.",1
"I am fully satisfied with Zomato offers and delivery on time .Especially I am happy with Zomato offers and more restaurants thank you Zomato for giving Good offers keep on going like this I will support Zomato forever if it is same happens and if any bad happens on Zomato ,again I will write it down .Now I am rating 5 out of 5 because of your offers and service maintains like this only thank you Allu Naresh",5
After clicking on place order.. app hung up for 10 min after which the order was placed. during this time I had to order from somewhere else and then they refused to cancel the order. even the chat helpline was not working while trying to char for 15min,1
Don't know what type of service you provide? My two refunds have been stuck from long time and whenever I talk to your representative he simply said we have initiated your payment and will reflect on your account in 5-7 business days. It's more than 7 days but I didn't get my money. Worst service I must and from I will my friends and relatives not order anything from Zomato instead use Swiggy. Very disappointed you guys are don't care about their hard earned money.,2
"Very bad service never plan your party with zomato they will spoil your party..it happened two times order came very late or some items are missing. They are not even responding to my complain..zomato valet told i will go to restaurent back and call you but he didn't call, i called restaurent he is saying i sent the correct item no one taking responsibility.",1
Quick and fast service,5
"There's no toll free number and service from zomato. I have missing item in my order. I didn't get the item, plus I lost my money. In addition to that, I am hungry and waiting desperately to find a way to resolving this issue.",1
"It is a good app. But there are issues with changing address. Once an address is saved, it is very difficult to change it. And moreover, payment cards are saved automatically into the app without even asking the customer. That is what I hate the most about this app.",3
The app is user friendly and with the update ( older version) has combined all their services into one. This has really been a revelation in terms of food ordering and dining and I'd recommend it to almost anyone who's interested in such services and would love to introduce the app to those who've never used it . Keep up the good work Zomato.,5
There is no option for cancel order. By mistake I pressed pay option before entering the Promocode sent by sms and amount deducted. Immediately I wanted to cancel to reorder the same with promocode. But Zomato told it cant be and whatever the amount paid will adjusted towards cancellation charges.,3
Best offers are avilible hear,5
Worst food ordering app ever 45 mins- 1 hour after u have placed an order someone will call from customer support to let you know that your order has been cancelled and they will process your refund and in future you will have to order from restaurants nearby your location and not to choose the suggestions shown in app...totally useless....better go with swiggy or foodpanda,1
"The GPS is completely wrong, whenever I put in my location and filter nearest restaurants by distance, it is always way off. Something that's 1km away says it's 90 metres from where I am! I use Google maps to find restaurants now, very frustrating.",2
"Very very very poor service.I can not contact the customer service, and I am not able to get help to cancle my order. Do not use this app at all.",1
"The reason why I gave 3 star is because the rates are quite higher on Zomato, I just love how many restaurants are available here, but the price is quite higher. Example, order McD from its direct website can give you better option and coupons.",3
"Zero responsibility for order delivery, pray that the restaurant has that item or you just lose your money for the next 4 days. Not helpful at all. Cancels order without warning especially after a long wait time and also after swallowing your money!",1
"Worst in case of interface, no response in chat, the rider has cancelled order on his behalf, no update on the app. I have to chat with the agent when the waiting timw is over and even no response from the agent. Delayed service.",2
"I have had over 4 bad experiences with delivery times, wrong info on their system and poor customer service. I have since signed up with Talabat and its been awesome ... Zomato u need to better your services and find a way to compensate customers when u mess up... Jan 2020 again Zomato poor service ...no more Zomato am deleting this app ...Def don't recommend",1
Delivery service is so so poor.. It takes too long time to deliver even from the nearest resturants which might take only 15 mins to travel... Otherwise no issue with quality and quantity of food... But the worst service.. And it continues to happen with me for the fourth time...,2
"Annoying By the time one gets used to the interface, they change the way in which one navigates. I am now not able to search items or restaurants in my area!!!!!!! Senseless UI designers.",2
My most horrible food experience with this app they cancelled my order with out my fault and not refunding my money . I have ordered earlier through this app has given my proper address and the order has been delivered. But now my address is not showing in their map and they cancelled my order. They are not refunding my money also. I have paid online. They are cheaters .I have also read the similar reviews .They are cheating people. It's a fraud food app.,1
I have made 2 orders but on first time it reflected that payment has failed. so I made payment again but later on got message from bank that payments are made twice. Zometo customer care support firt said that this is system problem. But now they are not responding. hope to receive a good response from you.,1
"Food is late most of the times, they assure within 30 mins delivery but it takes about an hour. To check on the reason for too much cooking time, there is no support and zero compensation.",1
Earlier I love to order through zomota due to quick service and good discount at some extent.. Now days it take more then 1 and half hours even though the time showing at the booking is 30 to 40 mins. Very horrible and get the feedback that Zomato is sorry for inconvenience cause.,2
I like the app but I'm not quite sure why it's insistent on reading my current location as Makati when I have never been to Makati in months. Update: The app has really become unhelpful to me because of the location problem.,1
The delivery guys will never be able to navigate to you even after you explain to them. Until you are forced to go downstairs to them wherever they are. I've walked more than 100 steps to reach to food that was supposed to be delivered to my doorstep. Awful.,1
"Worst and unprofessional people in food delivery business. Their chat with the support team option doesnt work despite me trying for over 100 times. They called me on old number ( though I had updated in my profile), delivery boys number was switched off,he took back the cake I ordered and didnt even refund my money saying food was already prepared! A loss 1k and also peace of mind. They didnt even follow my instructions to call me on my current number. Beware of these fradusters.",1
"people like me who always think they dont need a cook, they can get up early and prepare healthier and hygienic breakfast and lunch, but end up exactly doing the opposite, n rushing to office and being hungry ,zomato is an easy to get a brunch n say sorry to ur stomach n think u will get up early tomo for sure , zomato will be there tomo as well !",5
"The food that comes to you is stale . Believe me the reason they are offering such low prices is because the food that they deliver is leftover by people at restaurants. They ask you for photos when you ask for help, but how can I send a photo as I've already eaten the order by then.They dont even have a calling support service. Ordering from this app will ruin your mood and waste your money. This review is not after 1-2 orders but after years of experience. Don't choose low prices over quality",1
The worst experience I could ever get ordering food online is from this app. They don't het you what you order and moreover you get no one to even listen to your complaint. All they have to say is that they regret and will surely share the feedback with the team.,1
I have ordered today and due to my own reasons I had to cancel it immediately.The cancellation happened within 2 minutes of order delivery and they have charged a full fee as a cancellation penalty.This was acceptable if the cancellation had taken a longer time.This is absolute unfair and unjust.This has to reported to the consumer court.,1
"Apps is easy to used.....,",4
"huge restaurants database. good work. but the updated app with look and features, app became heavy and thick. means it takes more time to load and uses more data. plus the interface changed from simple to complicated",4
Please improve your open chat not clearly understood my word bad quality of food given me,1
"Its a very good app for d busy people.. it saves time as well as timely coupons saves ur money too. now it is being introduces in small cities as well, whenever i visit to my hometown it is my favourite task to just sit at home nd order varieties of food n snacks through Zomato❤",5
This is the first time i am using the app and it was a really good first try and i got the delivery real fast. The food did not gst cold or any problems with the food. So it is a really good app.,4
its ok from food delivery perspective ..the thing is that sometimes it takes too much time for responding on chat if a person has issue .. we can't call directly if we want to cancel our order or need to tell our concern ..it needs to improve its response time or provide some other way to contacting customer care. more over the customer care doesn't listen to your request properly and they haven't been able to provide me the paytm cashback after promising several times on chat,2
"zomato is a sick app... today the app gave me a pop up saying 30 to 50% off on all orders with no promo code. so placed my order... got no discount... went on to chat with the customer care... they says it's on selected restaurants and I need a code... why the he'll did the app say, all orders?? Also the customer service is just a set of bots and no humans... they are thought to say... sorry... regret.. etc... but can really resolve things for people... totally sick experience...",1
Really satisfied with the service!.. But there is a problem.. suddenly the restaurants stop taking orders and after some time again they start taking orders...I think they should fix this issue.,4
High taxes- distance fee delivery few surge fee etc etc.. and u r showing higher prices than the restaurant. We mostly used this app due to good offers and good service. But now this is critical . Look into the matter otherwise u will be wiped up in d market,1
"worst worst worst food app I've ever use. I was exploring foid and order placed accidently, after which they charged me full order cost as cancelation charge. Never use this useless app, they will even not ask you to how you want to pay, if you have money in your paytm wallet and unfortunatily orderd before, they will diduct your amount without asking you even once. worst experiance, highly disappointed.",1
"i have one complaint which is very very basic which zomato people not understanding even after provided feedback, why zomato people are so arrogant if something going wrong on app they should improve but zomato people seems very much intelligent that's why don't want any good correct suggestion.. I have ordered for food I rated for delivery boy but I didn't rate for food.. when I was trying to do this after finish my food.. I didn't get option because zomato need review without having food. fool",1
Its was very good expirence,5
"Worst food delivery app, Customer is unreachable nowadays, had to wait for 30 minutes till I can registered my complaint, And to all the problems they blame to the restaurant that it's their fault and thay Zomato can't do anything about it. I have been using this app since a long time but after this corona situation their service and customer support have went to worse.",1
system i have a suggestion......... 😋 some are completely eating on app i mean the whole month or week so tell them to pay once for complete month and let you create the menu for every day if it exceeds _price _ no need to explain 😂 i think you know and if any DISCOUNT it will be refunded 😊 howsssssssss tat...... ☝,5
"Worst app ever seen. I ordered food but after half an hour , i got a message that your order has been cancelled because of network issues with the delivery boy and all your money won't be refunded.",1
"Worst app, order was rejected by restaurant still cancellation fee was charged for me. Support people have agreed to refund. Now they are not replying to any of my emails nor chats. Disatisfied customer never use this app. Worst customer service/support. Worst food app.",1
"Nice app, but after first few orders there are no discounts. Update: App is working fine. No problem there! But some restaurants on it are really disappointing. Recently had a v.bad experience with one because they didn't follow my special instructions at all!",4
nonsense services... zomato is asking for solving wrong product same time delivered to me while i was having gatherings at my place... first of all my all guest faced problems due to delivering wrong product and now instead of providing customer service they are blaming that i didnt respond on same time..pathetic and useless app.,1
This app is phenomenal. They will do everything possible from their side to make the order reach to you even if they have to call the manager themselves. You have to face no trouble! Just that you can't cancel your order.,4
Very very bad service from zomato they confirm the order but send its too too late 2 and half hour and more.. very bad service i suggest people don't order from then tehy send the order too late when complain then they told only sorry. Then don't no about time of others people have important they not useless for wait 2 hour order .they also working people,1
Very very poor service,1
very horrible policy..if the order is placed there is no refund for the order...doesn't even matter. how much amount the order withholds.. and also there is no contact for customer care.. i don't know how. this app is used and managed.. it don't deserve even 1 star..,1
Wonderful experience. Ease of use. Lots of options. And obviously speedy. Tracking and payment is super smooth. No worries and just relax. Real time uodate of ur order is also available and very corteous and inteligent delivery guys.,5
faced a terrible experience.. we ordered thru Zomato it was being confirmed money deducted from account. Estimated time was given. but whn we called we got to know the order was cancelled without notifying us in any means if calls at least they could have sent a mail.. we contacted Zomato customer service after waiting for long time we were told to mail zomato. we did that too but till now we didn't get our refund or anything. this type of service from Zomato was not expected and not accepted!!,1
"no cancel option if by mistakely placed order they have to provide cancel option until restaurants accept it , and no quick reply from customer care i have placed order mistakenly and suddenly i msg to customer care to cancel it , but they replied after 8 minutes and saying that your order is already ready so i you have to pay penalty for it so i am giving one start to it",1
"Worst cancellation policy I place the order at 6.28 PM today and when I realized the order got placed,  immediately tried to cancel it on 6.29 PM But with utmost shock it was showing,  the cooking has started hence will be charge RS.  137 as cancellation charge.  I failed to understand that how can hotel start cooking within few seconds of placing the order and thus am required to pay cancellation charge, and they are still cooking the food after 45 mins...",1
"Worst food application ever, made an order from a restaurant, as per the tracking system, my order got accepted, never received my order and zomato are not replying back and they have their bot system taking complaints. The restaurant claims that zomato system is old and not working hence why the order wasnt made. Obviously I have not received my online payment.",1
very good app even i am able to get food in cheaper rates but there is only one problem that the price shown in the app are usually higher than the actual one. so its is not pure 50% off its only 10 to 20 % off.,5
"very bad service....they are not reachable when you try to contact them if facing any issue ...we are ordering food not a thing where they should deal with the issue then and there in that case why should we order food online...asking to send an email, and customer care is pathetic.....",1
Worst ever app! Twice my order was showing payment incomplete when the payment was already done via online transaction . You guys are cheating and I'll soon file a case in consumer forum as there is no way of talking to customer care not complain about the details of the order. It happened twice within an hour,1
Available service area is a small zone. In my native place non-service area.. Please improve that... Thank you,5
Has very bad customer care support and take action on order without customer consent.... You have to reach them again n again for a single query still it is not resolved. They say they will help but they will never come back to you even after approaching them... They lie to customers and hold their money with them.,1
"So much money to invest on advertising, can't appoint someone who can talk to customer. My order has issue no one to talk accept ai message service. * Your days will be over when international apps will roll out their services throughout the country with their international standard support team. Good luck till then.",1
"Payment using food card is not happening always. Sometimes we are getting gateway failure. During this time,I have to make payment as cash on delivery and then I have to tap the option pay online and completing payment using food card",4
Bad experience. Worst app I had ever seen. Refund policy hopeless. We won't get proper response from customer care. I had cancelled my order but I didn't get any refund. They are not giving importance to customers.,1
"I'm very upset that default ordering changed in zomato and to find the place where I'm sitting currently is quite complicated. Previously default ordering was by distance and the same was working perfectly Upd: And support bot works disgusting, so reducing from 3 points to 2",2
"Worst service from support team. No option to chat to tell the problem. Food came was unsealed and it was spread all over the box, vegetables and dal all got mixed and when we wanted to contact Zomato, they don't have any proper response. Only automatic reply messages. Worst experience.",1
"your customer support is worst ,I had issue with my order I asked them to resolve that but they said that they will not be able to helo me now as a seperate team will revert me asap and when I asked is there any fix time interval as within what time they will revert they said there is no time limit.what is this should I wait for this resolution for such less amount for a year or what?",2
Pathetic service..its been more than 40 mins restaurant has not accepted my order even no answer from the customer support from 30 mins.i called the restaurant they are saying they have not received any order.no options to cancel the order and I already paid for it. Just cancel my order and refund my money.,1
"Extra charges on peak hours are too high n its unnecessary most of the time. Also regarding customer service, the service after 11- 11:30 pm isn't great at all ... The executives try to console the customer than helping with a solution .",4
"Their services are pathetic. I ordered breakfast at 8:22 am and it was delivered to me at 9:39 am. and When I complained on the app the executive wrote, your ordered is delivered, enjoy your meal. he didn't pay any heed to my complaint. I have tried reaching out to zomato but no one cares, they are money whopping wh*res",1
"I am only giving one star because I cannot give zero stars.Terrible service.They advertised a promo code for 50% on first 3 orders, and counted my unsuccesful orders as first 3 and did not allow me to use promo saying I am not a new customer. I had signed up only the day before and placed only one order(that too without using the discount promo).And very very poor customer service. The customer service personnel did nothing to solve my problems and gave generic answers.Please don't choose this.",1
"very worst delivery. Hotel people say order was given to the delivery person ,we are not responsible after that. My last 2 orders weren't delivered.but money debited. Another one order was cancelled but refund didn't give. Totally disappointed with this app. In the beginning it was good. not sure",1
"I ordered foodies set dosa.. the set is good .. but the sambhar is like dal no taste, red cutney has no taste..",5
"I miss Ubereats and its offers. Even with Zomoto gold you can get single penny back when you order online. If you try to order using Zomoto gold, the restaurants you are looking for won't be available if you opt Zomoto gold. No discount on delivery charges for Zomoto gold users. Rates are also too high compared to Ubereats.",2
Worst experience. The location shown to the driver and me was different from the location where the food was prepared. Waited for approximately 2 hours and had to cancel the order in the end. And didn't get the full refund too.,1
Terrible support service. They're only interested in closing the chat rather than trying to help you solve the issue. Even my refund was 25% lesser than what I paid. Extremely unsatisfied.,1
Bad experience because you don't have any quantity check i got my order of full main course which is not satisfactory at all. You are unable to take any kind of responsibility because you don't have any policy for a min quantity check. Customer can get a piece of veg in the name of full main course. Zomato can't do anything because quantity and price fix by restaurants only,1
"Very bad services because if any mistake happens by customer side this app have no options to correct suppose if you chose any order with any quantity you must have to pay for that hardly matters customer satisfaction or whether you recieve the order orif you cancel you have ti pay ,and after wasting my time declined order not refunded back ...",2
the customer support for zomato will test your patience to the utmost limit. probably the worst i have ever seen. they will make you wait and wait and wait before they can finally connect. no signs of improvement from a long time.,1
I don't know what people think about it and say but I have ordered many things by this app and I am feeling happy because all time I got hot things in my home and else if you talk me about customer service that is also good this is a good app for buying food online you can go for it some people and saying that this is worst app but I can saythat i am using the best app for buying food online,5
"Not able to cancel. I tried cancelling as soon as I ordered as I'd forgotten to apply the promo code. But, I couldn't proceed as it said the hotel has started preparing food and I won't be getting a refund.",1
I ordered curd and wanted to cancel it within a minute of ordering but the chat executive said since the order preparation began you will have to pay cancellation fee. But curd needs no preparation so cancellation fee reason is not valid. The chat executive still insisted that cancellation fee will be charged without stating a valid reason. Worst experience ever!,1
"Pathetic service.I ordered food & entered the delivery address as Kadma( screenshot order summary present) but your Valet and customer care person calls ,talks rudely and says the delivery address is somewhere else .My order is cancelled with no refund.Moreover,you have given only the chat option through which no one replies.Its very smart of you not to give a customer care executive number to address the customer queries. From now on I'll suggest everyone not to use ur unprofessional service.",1
great discounts here and nice to use.. however i have faced issues like burnt food received.. incomplete and less qty of order received and couldnot get proper resolution from their customer servuce team..i ended up with loosing money and no food.. this is where they need to improve,5
Great app for your favorite food 😋😋😋😋,5
one star less because it takes a while to make the valet person understand the address.. half of them are not even using GPS properly.. nd it only happens in Kanpur.. in Delhi nd othr NCRs i saw them drop the order at exact place.. in kanpur they take a lot while to understand the house address and at times they are unaware of the locality as well which is a bit irritating..,4
It is the worst app. I ordered something today and then the merchant calls me and tell me that the ingredients for the order are not available. Then zomato calls me and tells me that we will initiate the refund but it will come in 4-5 business days. What is this? I am left with nothing. i cant order food from somewhere else as my money is also stuck. They dont know how to treat a customer.,1
"They dont care abt customer's expectations! And fail to get the delivery agents to deliver to the correct address! And then they say your refund will be sent to u in 5-7 working days! Basically the customer care executives they are feeding is just for show! They fail to provide with real solutions! All they say is "" we are sorry for your inconvenience""!",1
"please don't install this app, they are very rude and they also provide very late service. I ordered 7 large pizzas from Dominos and it took them 3 hours to travel just 6 kilometers, my friends who came they kept waiting but at last they had to pizzas. At last when I decided to cancel my order and refund my money back as I would not be able to eat it all alone, they said they can't refund, you won't get your money back,😡😡 They even don't know how to behave with their customers 😤😤😠😠🤬",1
Not satisfied But good quality of food 🥝,5
The worst app ever. Last time i ordered food and got completely leaking food from container and also remain food was completely salty. And i tried to reach restaurant by taking number from zomato app but number was invalid. So tried to mail them and ask for refund and its been 10 days with almost 15 mail but only reply i got is that we have understand you completely kindly goes with review thats all they dont have any intention of refunding my money. But compare to other food app they do listen.,1
"Very bad food delivery service, delivery guy doesn't follow the map to deliver the food. They always ask to share the location using WhatsApp, and then again annoys the customer to explain the route over the phone. Also sometimes the delivery guy doesn't even deliver the food and marks the food as delivered. And on calling them they say they have delivered the food. So we as a customer end up not getting the food and also pay for that.",1
"very bad experience with live chat. People won't reply if you need help. if they reply, some unfriendly person will just come type whatever he/she wants to and leave. this happened twice in a week. never pay before getting the order these people won't help you after they get the money.",1
"The worst experience I have ever had on an online food delivery. My order was accepted , after around 45 minutes I asked why its not picked up, I was assured it will be done in 10 minutes . And after waiting for 1 hour 15 minutes, I was told its declined. Three words ""Zomato is worst""",1
It keeps lagging and doesn't work. Everytime I wish to order food from the app I have to uninstall it and resinstall for it to start again. I have a Zomato gold membership that I've paid for which now I'm unable to access due to this app issue. I have written to Zomato via mail and have received no response yet. It's been two months now,1
Perfect and trusted app for food delivery. But sometimes my order cancelled due to closure of restaurant even after payment. However the payment has been refunded but I got troubled. Zomato should update about restaurant close or open properly and timely.,4
"Worst experience with zomato. Without informing they charge penalty on cancelling order, even cancelling after few seconds of ordering. Rude staff , Rude delivery boys, every order take minimum 50 to 55 min to reach. All we have to do is to uninstall this nonsense app. Otherwise any of you can also be cheated one day...Uninstall...",1
Best food delivery service,5
"Wonderful cancellation policy. And very helpful staff. Touch the order placed button and there is no cancellation option. Even within seconds of placing the order. Great policy. You want some free money ask for it guys, we will be helpful in donating. Kindly stop cheating.",1
"I have ordered lunch from zomato,all seals are opened.delivery boy had my lunch..still they did nothing",1
"APP IS GOOD, SERVICE IS ALSO A BIT COOL. Please have a dedicated call centre. Also i would like to know why do you charge 50% higher rate in average than the original restaurant process ?? We party extra for the food and then we pay delivery charges as well, any specific reasons ??",3
"Zomato service is not as good as i expected.service representative give only fake promises.i had ordered.some how restaurant declined.but still i was charged Didn't get money back.when i complain on email they said amount will be refunded but till date no amout is refund. they are only giving Lolipop to customers. what ever the amout is, it doesn't matter. but they are thinking we are fool.suppose to switch over other service provider.",1
Due to zomato it is easy to get food at new places and when you are also busy in your work you can order your food online. Too much easy to get the restaurant's menu and to order food. Quality & quantity both are best.,5
"They let the the restaurants deliver unlike swiggy. it's been over an hour since i placed the order, the restaurant number is busy. there is no response on the chat support. there is no helpline number. absolutely ridiculous.",1
"Remove delivery charge for pro , delivery charges hurting to us in other applications there is no delivery charge for pro",4
"this was one of my favourite app but today i am really really disapponited i dont even want to give a single rating.their delivery man are cheaters,liers& thieves i order something from a restaurant and then i got the notification that my order has been delivered to a location at around 4 kms away from my location..i immediately contact the delivery man and he said that he delivered it to someone else along the way and claimed that the person he delivered told him my name & address which is a lie",1
"pathetic experience with zomato.... they don't mention the proper address of different outlets.... n then charge complete amount of cancelled order.... u should give a column reason of cancellation as well.... pathetic service ever.... n then ur cce said... whether the order is of 10000 ,we charge complete money.... go to hell u zomato.... swiggy is much better than u....",1
Very bad quality food served,1
Very inconvenient address providing system. Address is expected to be typed by me as well as corrected on the map. Got my order cancelled because of it. And had a bad experience with the customer care as well.,1
Worst aap cash on delivery mode for payment is not working. So many times i have complained about this but every time they say that they will work on it but nothing happen... and now i am not able to use this aap.,1
The chat option in help section doesn't help and close itself after sending 'Thanks for contacting' even if the order had some issue and the food item is not edible at all. There is no option to get your spent money back if the order is stale or had any issue.,1
"Make the search more intuitive in the app especially after you have ""Go Out"" and Delivery broken into two different tabs. The search tab should also an in-tab choice for Go Out and Delivery, instead of having a different search field in all 3 tabs.",4
Delivery boys are arrogant rude and unprofessional,1
Zomato valet do not pickup their phone ever.. same for the restaurent owners...chat wait time is always showed as 1 minute but one gets to chat after 5 mins only..... one cannot cancel an order even if the order is not accepted...you have to chat and cancel your cancel order... and the chat guy will keep asking u for the cancel confirmation again and again.. this entire process can take 15 to 20 min.. which gives zomato enough time to send their valet to the restaurent and make them accept order,1
"Had I eaten such bad food, I would have fallen prey to food position. The chicken was smelling very dirty.did not throw food ever but I had to throw it. Please do not play with people's health. If you are taking money, also maintain quality. After this, I will never order food from Jomato in my life. If you are a mediator, it is your duty whether the hotel is clean or not and it gives good food or not, but you don't do it. Do not send people in the mouth of death by eating bad food.",1
zomato is very nice application who care about there customers and give the best service as much as they can. you will find alll variety of food and near by resturant and get food deliver on the time. Love there customer service. Happy to use it.,5
The only annoying thing here is the customer care support. Otherwise everything is going pretty well. They should have people for solving issues rather than automated teply system. And also a customer care number.,3
#First of all one line about zomato is The worst worst customer service or customer care support.. Less effective interface... Payments are done successfully but Orders are not placed.Every time in my Case. And coming to the refund it takes a long long time for them and then also credit only half of the amount...,1
The service was great but the only reason i rated 1 star because is not right to cheat your costumers like that. I accidentally ordered something and for cancellations u penelty of the full amount of order .In what case thas fare to u.???? Just so sad about that and please try to help me with that,1
"This app is so intelligent that even after receiving the order, it will still show as on the way... Algorithm is awesome... After the person came infront my door message in app..it takes 15 minutes to ask for feedback.",1
"I am a food lover and am just amazed with its dilivery and every other facility. Although, some are hot headded, but others arw too polight. And the quality of food is also up to the mark. I just love this app.Food lovers go for it.",5
TOO much time take for delevary,1
Seriously I don't understand why Zomato takes orders from such a far away places like more than 15 km away from my location why would I order food from such a far place this is not the first time it has happened many times Zomato app it should show only the nearest available restaurants which is available at my location seriously nobody likes the food from such a far away place and food would have become COLD and you will put pressure on the delivery agent to deliver it fast,1
very nice and convenient app. saviour at times when its really needed. exciting offers at times. the delivery guys are really hard working and cordial. I found this the best food delivery app compared to other apps. keep up the good work guys.,5
"This app does let you cancel your order now, which was a major problem with zomato. Zomato is very much customer oriented, helpful and the prices of the restaurants are reasonable too. If you want your delivery on time within reasonable price and also informations about some restaurant, this is your app.",5
Delay in services,2
If we try to click chat support automatically page gets refreshed and back to the same order page.Most of the time it was difficult to connect with chat support even if connected no proper response other than getting usual template. Couldn't contact Zomato through this APP chat support option when order cancelled but no message from zomato about money refund.,1
"never make online payment.I have paid for the order,delivery boy took the order and cancelled.i lost my money and food too.customer service never reaponded and no refund.Am uninstalling this worst app. contacting customer care when required is not available. only chat option is there but no response. i have ordered my food half an hour back but still no idea whether the order placed or not.",1
Bad experience when ever i try to place order it shows more taxes even i have gold membership. Sometime taxes are more then half of the price of whole food amount no benefit of gold membership. I think normal zomato is enough . But the taxes are more for non gold members as well prefer less to use zomato.,2
"Don't even bother to install it. Swiggy is better by far. The customer support sucks, if you don't receive what you paid for they will not refund your money and they will not do anything to help you. They will only reply with automatic responses. Better install Swiggy.",1
"Worst, 😣 instant orders are taken but no of chance refund at all. Very intelligent n cunning. Ready to take orders, but not ready to take further request for refund. And very poor customer services. Only emails and text messages.",1
"worst service my item is missing and chat room says that we can not do anything. we said at least give my missing item to us and they said we can not do that. chat recponce is more terrible experience, it has taken 20 mins to respond. 3rd class service",1
"Hi, I compared the price of food in restaurant - spice and chillies in my account and my friends account. I find that, The price is too high for me and a low price for my friend for same food item.  What is happening could you clarify me? I raised a complain for my last order and you gave me zomato credits/coupon for compensating it!! I suspect that you are trying to cheat me with a eye wash of zomato credits and making a food price high.",1
"Overall experience of using the service is good, but certain UI features that are essential are difficult to navigate like the ""cart"" also the picture of dishes should be mandatory to be put up by every restaurant. Also portion sizes should be mentioned for food items.",4
"Swiggy is certainly more user friendly but lately Zomato have upped their game. What i loved about this app is I ordered same thing from same restaurant in a span of 2 days from both the apps and both times the restaurant cancelled while swiggy gave me an option to reorder or cancel, zomato gave me 100 rs discount for my next order with 30 days validity.",5
The best and fastest delivery,5
"satisfactory as an information application. but when it comes to delivery, USE SWIGGY. Zomato is one of the worst applications i have ever used. orders get accepted and 1 hour later i get a call saying order not possible. so why accept it in the first place? USE SWIGGY",1
Very much disappointed with this app because it doesn't work properly in small cities(Rishikesh). The food is being prepared by the restaurant but the company doesn't send any delivery boy/girl.,1
very quick service,3
"very disappointed.. u people ask first to mention the instructions specified to the order.. when i write the specific and ckear instructions regarding the dish i want to have, it is not been delivered to the restaurant, i called te person concerned to the restaurant.. and when i cancel the order u include the cancellation charges with it.. the worst food app.. seriously.. n where the hell is the executive person to whin we can talk to..",1
Packing system is very poor and bad.,1
Pathetic service 😡. This is not what i was expecting from Zomato. Firstly it took almost above an hour for delivering my order and then after that I got a call from Zomato valet that your location is not valid and then I denied to receive my order and secondly they have asked me to pay the cancellation charges. What type of service are you providing 😑,1
The delivered food was came out of the bowl and I raised a complaint the team will say I will refund the 50 rupees what should I do with your 50 Worst experience on Zomato..,1
delivery is good but the problem for me is payment through phonepe. If i tried to pay through phonepe then it directly asked to cut the amount from bank account even if there is money in the phonepe wallet. we want zomato to take wallet money first and then the account money.,3
"Worst experience on the app After ordering from the best restaurants according to their fake ratings, they provide cheap quality food which is oily and smelly and then when you go to customer support for help. They just copy paste the same lines and don't provide any good solution and close the case if they can't help Such a pathetic customer support services. I'm not satisfied at all, i even have screenshot of their chat support system that how they argue with the customers.",1
It one of the best online food ordering app. But one major problem s that the delivery charge is way too much. Space for some improvement is still there but still it will give u the best experience....!!!!!!!!,5
cant use the app after the new update on my note 8 before the update it was useful but not now have been using this app for a while. wanted to order but couldnt decide what to eat opened the application and it showed that something went wrong then uninstalled it and installed it again still not working....please help sort out the issue.........it is working on the note 4 but not on my note 8 plus it wasnt able to detect my location also,2
"placing order on a food app can be tedious,but zomato makes it a nice experience. not only ordering but it makes sure that even finding a restaurant is easy and pleasant. there is a lot of competition out there for food apps, but zomato is a go to app for any kind of search. i like the way it has a tip option to tip the delivery guys. makes it a nice interface. the GUI is also ergonomic and fun to use, though it might appear crowded to some people. the inclusivity of the app is good.",5
I've had no problems ordering food on the Zomato app. The app is easy to use and the service is extremely reliable. As compared to other similar apps Zomato has the most user friendly interface. I've always had a great experience on Zomato.,5
I am uninstalling zomato app untill you hire innocent delivery guy and take proper action against the lady who registered false complaint againt him,1
I recently placed an order on amazon and it was cancelled without proper acknowledgement. They could not wait for. 10 minutes and cancelled the order and charged me fully. They do not have any direct contatc listed when i tried to contat them their chat had a waiting time of 5 minutes Pathetic service offered,1
"The swiggy service is more better than the zomato Zomato is not have call support if customer have any problem, there is only chat support and there is also not respond on time and they are not clarify our issues Zomato is cheats the customers Swiggy is more better in delivery, solving issues, support, and they have call support to solve the problems fast",1
majority of the time i come back from work late at night and would be super hungry. zomata accepts my order...makes me wait for good 20 mins and then cancels it because the restaurant is not open. when will you even list it if not opened. IT team in zomato is bad. examples can be taken from swiggy,2
"Pathetic delivery service and equally poor customer support. The food was delivered 30 min after it was supposed to, and obviously it was cold. Zomato service has gone down over last few months considerably. Really sad to see that.",1
All workers and resto is good but the customer support very very bad.i ordered something and they cancelled my order Because of distance they called and informed and gave assurity of refund but they refunded only half amount.and no response by them we can not talk to them directly and i dropped mail but no reply from them.. really this is not acceptable..,1
"My city has just started the zomato delivery service, and I've even seen the delivery boys out there with the order parcels around the city, but still when i put the name of my city in the location panel in the app, it says that the sevice isn't available here ! Do look into the matter ASAP, please !",1
one of the worst app to order food online. I ordered the food two times and after making the payment i waited for 30 minutes and then the restaurant cancelled my order. If they are not able to deliver then why the hell you are accepting the orders?,1
Very nice App... Sooo Happy.,5
Worst service and showing invalid data to user's. It was 15min time for delivery for past 30 min how can this be accepted when you are charging more for delivery. Instead you guys would have shown original waiting time to avoid frustrating users.,1
"Bogus service. Today ordered combo meals. Quantity is too low compared to the price. Delivery boy came without uniform, without change as well as without hot pack. Unprofessional conduct. Not recommended. Swiggy is by far the best.",1
Zomato’s service seems to be declining by the day. Anytime I order it takes couple of hours. The food would be ready at the restaurant but the Zomato delivery personnel is never available. It’s better to order directly from the restaurant itself instead of going through Zomato.,1
They don't reply to text always late in delivering the order . No sign of refund . I waited for the food all night and when i tried to cancel the order they won't even let me do that. They spoiled my night won't return my money back . One of the worst experience I had ordering. I would recommend using SWIGGY instead.,1
"Very poor customer service, incompetence in resolving issues via app chat options, and no replies on mail as well. Frequently delivers wrong item contradiction to what ordered. Customer should order at their own risk, Zomato doesn't take any responsibility of customer service. Extremely dissatisfied.",1
"Easy to order, countless options for everything, quick delivery, best discounts and I love their £ coins concept. But I hate their Help section. You never get help on any issue. They must work on their customer care section.",3
Love everything about this app! Smooth UI and I've never had any problems with their customer service. Zomato Gold is the cherry on top. I just wish that restaurants would not raise their prices on the app.,5
"New interface is difficult to navigate, some menu selection like top foodies no longer works, also what happened to been there button?? This was my favourite feature now it's gone. The new options for review is good and i do like how you can add your own tag for foods",2
Zomato — didn't deliver ordered items and not refunding my money. They are not ready to follow up with the restaurant as well. You don't have customer care number to complain. You have in app chat which is useless. Customer support is just trained to apologize not more than that. When you start asking refund they will stop replying. Better opt for other food delivery apps. CHEATERS.,1
"Poor service, I paid for an order which was cancelled later but even after weeks I didn't get my money, and theyare just delaying the process saying that all we can do. Would never use this app again. So beware while you order next time.",1
"Worst experience.. Third consecutive order got delayed !! lost hope on timely delivery so stoped chating with zomato agent.. better place order straight with hotel... My awaiting order was requested @12.05pm promised delivery time 12.52pm and current time 1.17pm... @1.25pm got update from hotel, mistakenly food went to heaven and they are trying level best to bring back to earth in 5 mins 😁😁.. @1.43pm Eureka😂😂 my food arrived !!",1
You guys have became crazy. I ordered food which they cancelled saying number was unreachable and i wasnt available at my location(i didn't get any call or any knock at my door which was open). Also they refused to return the money or to deliver the food and left the conversation. This is the second time it happened to me. It was my mistake I trusted them again. I use swiggy Zomato both but only for Zomato i becomes unreachable and never for swiggy. I wish could give negative rating to ZOMATO.,1
worst bleady app.. you don't get anything delivered in time and the chat is useless.. don't waste your time or money waiting... I ordered food once and they never delivered.. yet had to fight for my money.. now they accepted the orders and dint deliver... don't fool yourself people,1
"I like the old zomato. When you leave the app, the page is still there but the new zomato if you leave the app you will start all over again. Not like before where you'll pick up where you left off.",3
"Very non cooperative helpline services. Once they get the payment, the order itself got cancelled and they have still not refunded my money back. Every time I seek support it says wait for 24 to 48 hours while it's been 14 days.",1
there is nothing to enjoy... i get bored when food is on the way.... delivery charges are so high that i can not afford to order anything and i syay hungry all the time... Suggestion: Must add a freeplay game while it takes time to deliver the food...😑😶 leave it i am so depressed !!,1
i have a concern. once we ordered two order continueously.. we couldn't see the status of first order .. we misunderstood that the order was not placed.. nd replaced the first order in another mobile.. later we asker to refund the amount by cancelling the first order.. but they cancelled the order and didn't consider our request . so please consider and refund the amount ..,1
"Really Great, Only some slow map loading issues are there and if that improved it would be great than swiggy.Great chat executives update the informations rapidly and great response. Don not think of negative reviews you guys are doing great.If good is there always bad ones will try to bring them down. Keep Going Zomato.......😘",5
if you want to know about any local restuarants..then u can count on it..but if you are thinking of ordering foods..then i recommend to give a second thought.. many of their partner restuarants have poor intetntion of taking care of their delivery..i had 4-5 times when i had found my food spilled before being delivered.. and their customer service is by far one of the slowest and worst i have faced across.. if you r thinking of ordering..trust me..go for swiggy..far better in this aspect..,1
worst experience i ever had. my order hasn't arrived for 2 hours. no way of getting a refund. nobody to contact for my concerns. The support agent stopped replying at his convenience. Now i am left without food and still paying for it. absolutely unprofessional. never using it again.,1
Very bad service from zomato and their delivery boy. Worst app ever seen..swiggy is much better than this and their service is good...I had a very bad experience recently with zomato..the delivery boy was very rude . I didnt have change and he wasn't ready to compromise with Rs. 3 so I didnt compromise with Rs.7 ..the total of the order was 143 and I had 200 with me..he said he has no problem if I m cancelling the order and he said he will not arrange the change for me.so I just had to return it,1
"Great app.. Covers almost every restaurant. It's a bit sad though that they raise the peices to give a discount.. It's a little misleading. Else the interface is good, the functioning is good. All in all a great experience.",4
"App is good..bt when it comes for the service part, the service of the valets towards customers is pathetic at times.",1
"You add too much tax, what are you thinking of us like fool, we understand these things, first you add 40 rs tax+whatever, and then you give us 40% discount. And also you already show price more than the actual. Well that's fine but at least don't add this much tax. And there should be proper chat section, in chat you only give us options if we have quarries other than that, then we have to find an alternative to talk to you. That's bad. Otherwise the service is good",3
"Worst service. I placed an order , it was confirmed and later Its cancelled and I'm charged for it with the reason that my number was unreachable, I didn't even get single call , the other food delivery apps never had this issue .",1
"Best restaurant The interior of the resultant is lovely. This is perfect for family dining. Only the Chinese and north foods are available. I ordered Navratan korma and cheese nan and Gulab jamun. The food arrived quickly, within 15 mins. Specially I loved Navratan Korma especially. Here service is great and staffs are very friendly to guide you with the different foods on the menu.",5
"Third class app. Everytime we try to place order, it shows no cash on delivery option available. If we go for online payment, then says the hotel accepts cash only. Need to improve a lot on such small things.",1
costs of dishes on zomato are far more than that on the restaurant menu.. this is a cheat.. zomato has displayed increased cost and then offering 50 %...60% discount that too upto 100 or 120 bucks.. and approximately 50 rs per dish cost is already increased.. so they are actually not giving any discounts.. they are just making people fool by showing discounts.. please check before ordering !,2
Worst service. They do not provide tax invoice. I had faced missing items on my order. The support team is not prompt. I had trouble with each and every orders. Very disappointing.,1
"Sell products on the higher price than the actual menu price of resturant..and above that charging heavy delivery charges for really nearby places. Even not getting any good offer inspite of being a Gold Member. Then what's the use of this paid membership, when i am not any good discount and have to pay additional Delivery and Packaging charges for the food, which is already listed on higher price on their app.",2
"Very pathetic service, never delivered food on time, there is always delay in delivering the order. No proper customer care number. Chat agents talk like bots and do copy paste jobs. No human interactions. Highly dissatisfied with this organization and app.",1
"No automated order delay check by Zomato. After 65 minutes Valet assigned says he doesnt have the order. Customer service says ""the delivery boy assigned has not got your order in his device"". The only option is to cancel the order. Worst application and poor customer service.",1
"Pathetic delivery service, They misplace half of your order. this is the second happening with me. this time the breads were missing.. what do i do with the gravy items... such a sham this Zomato has turend out. won't suggest anyone. one suggestion to all, if at all you order from it, don't pay in advance, always choose pay on delivery option.",1
"Such terrible service in payments. I am regular user and every month I face this issue of payment block. This time it's been long enough and I did not get my money back. You fail to provide the service you promise and then block customer's money, causing such distress. Highly disappointed. Your CC wont even answer also",1
Worst! My order got soooo delayed. And they raised price after order.,1
zomata charged me for complete bill send only half items.zomato support has not answered till now its been 1 hr that i have raised this issue. unfortunately I lost my money and appetite. ill suggest not to use this app for food odering beacuse they do not have any back plans for such issues. if still using this app make sure you order received is app per your bill.,1
"My address changed to a different address saved on my app, without me changing it. Then, I ordered. It was connected to the wrong address. I have no way to cancel and zomato isn't responding.",1
"It is a very good application, delivering fast and delicious food at the door step. But the whole system of discount available with the app is a big lie and eventually the price is same. Order value before and after discount is totally same.",4
"Worst service ever. I ordered the food and after waiting for 45 minutes my order was cancelled automatically. On calling the delivery guy, i was told that he has left the place and has marked the order as rejected without any reason. I have received no refund even after posting multiple complaints.",1
"Pathetic app, uninstalled. For a 60 Rs food which is less than 5 mins from my place you are asking 35 Rs delivery charges plus taxes, why would someone pay double to you. Also the food prices are on the higher sides(ubereats was much better) sadly its gone, that doesnt mean we would want to switch to zomato now. Your app deserves to be uninstalled, so did it Zero star",1
Worst experience ever. I have ordered two dish already paid and getting one dish. Support team is saying that they can't do anything. I will recommend that don't use this app. Being a Zomato gold member I never felt that much cheated ever. Not I am being cheated and help support is just doing nothing and telling they can't help. What kind of service Zomato is providing. Total money waste,1
It was an worst experience. I order and it got cancelled from restaurant's side. I wrote many emails to the help desk but I didn't get my money back. They charged me and didn't provide me the food. Hope I have an option to give negative star one start is more than what they deserve,1
One of the biggest issue they can't cancel your order even if the restaurants or dominoes are not able to give you any specific delivery time. I had to wait 4hrs for my pizza to get delivered. Better to use SWIGGY!,1
A very nice and easy app to use. The app includes live tracking feature which really makes it easy to track details about the order also an urgent delivery option is available for sick or unwell people.I would always recommend zomato .A big thumbs up from my side to zomato,4
"Pathetic. kept asking to mark my location on map and failed to save it eventhough my internet was working fine. Also, before ordering it said the particular restraunt delivered to my location but later it said it does not. Never using zomato again.",1
useless service.... they said by cancelling the order that the delivery address and current GPS address is different.... but the fact was total 3 delivery were successful and last one was had a problem... how come this happen I m not getting it.... the delivery rider was useless person really u can say CHOR to them,1
"Prices are too inflated. With every new update somehow magically prices of all the dishes increase by 5-10%, have been observing this since last few years. Restaurants would profit if we call them directly to order instead of ordering through Zomato.",1
"This gives some awesome discounts. There're wide range of restaurants to pick from. Taxes and Charges are little high. Except that, one of the best apps to order food.",4
I faced so much issue in my recent order from zomato. The delivery boy is asking me to cancel the order. Your chat system was not at all helpful to me. I am really disappointed by your service . My order hasn't arrived yet.,1
"Was a big fan of zomato. But it has really bad customer support now. Zomato doesn't take responsibility of anything and there is no guarantee that your food will get delivered. Plus, they don't even care to take your concerns. Can keep you waiting for hours at times.",1
"Please Allow Us To Provide Different Phone Numbers For Different Address. Everytime We Can't Change Phone Number From Profile. Please Add This Feature For Betterment. I Order For Me, My Friend, My Best Friend, My Brother, My Uncle. And Everyone's Address Is Different. Each Time Delivery Valet Calls Me. So Please Add This Feature To Use Different Phone Numbers For Every Address. Thank You.",2
"I used almost all the online food delivery apps,but Zomato is much better than anything else.It is easy to use,everything is familiar for the user's and most of all it is always covered with new,exciting offers.",5
I had an incorrect order and the customer service is also too bad. They are not responding to the customers quickly,1
A restaurant delayed the delivery. Informed the same to Zamato. They were quick enough to respond with the update and also gave some credit. It was a nice gesture and really made a difference. Keep up the good work !,5
Cart details doesn't load. Service takes too much time to load details and checkout. Performance issues. Fix the checkout issues or you will lose business. 1 star app. When I try checking out it get ... Please try again later message.,1
yesterday midnight i order from one of the restaurant through your app. they accept my order and charges of my bill is already deducted from my account. and even i get the notification about my order that it is on my way to deliver and i waited for two straight hours for my order to reach me they cancelled. and they are not even answering phone calls. i still have not received my money back. worst experience. worst management. Will not use this service again.,1
Horrible experience since the update. Payment gets credited from the bank and it doesn't get processed. Moreover the zomato gold delivery never processes and the worst part is that h cannot call their customer care at all! U get some random AI chat which is annoying to say the least.,1
"Generally I don't review the app. But I want to register that they have dumbest app and dumbest tracking system. On top of that, dumbest agent on customer support who doesn't have knowledge and sense to handle the customers. Thanks for the experience..!",1
"The concerned order was cancelled under - the wrong user address. We would like to inform you that according to new policies of Zomato if there the difference between your stated delivery address and the pinned location is more than 1 KM, the order is cancelled and no refund is initiated here. Post logistics investigation, we found out that there was a discrepancy in your stated delivery address and the pinned location by 6.3 KM's due to which the order was cancelled by our rider.",1
i love this..app ..its so easy to order any..food ..its coupon vocher..its also ..valuble. for me..its hai..very . helpful for foody..we can see many food..and we observed many tasty food..i have no words to discribe .this will a huge. things that..make person..so easy than .his .. complement...i like this. thank u,3
placed an order today which i didn't get for 2hrs. 10 min. This has happened before also. zomato needs to own misses rather than telling customer hope you understand. there are multiple things which can be done to rectify error. proactively replace order or do a conf call to help with alternate rather than jus saying we apologise,1
"Totally disappointed, they messed up my orders and when I tried to contact, did not get back to me. Utter garbage app.",1
When I was thinking that there is nothing to eat in my home Then Zomato is the only option I get into my mind,5
"Pathetic support as they loot you if you wish to change the order. I contacted the merchant, delivery guy & zomato before hand but they said they will help & cancelled the order. They said some amount will be deducted to which I agree but they deducted the entire amount & said sorry. Swiggy is much better in terms of service. I will never use this App again",1
"Delivery servise of order is very bad. i orderd food many times , app show me 30 - 40 minutes delivery time but i never got order under two hours. while actually distance of restaurant from my house is 15-20 minuts. so now i dont zomato app, i goes to shop and buy food.",1
"Worst experience. Chat wait time is forever. Rider never picks up call. They cancel your order after an hour, and guess what, by that time you can't order again because it's too late. That's how they treat customer.",1
"YourApp payment gate way, when making payment sometime auto reading option is not coming, so in that case on manually entering the bank OTP amount get deducts and after sometime the auto reading of OTP also acts and 2nd time again payment gets deducted. This I can prove by statement. This type of things are considered fraud and need to resolved.",1
I loved this app as well as service and discount but the delivery charge is too high,3
It's a good app but sometimes 1 Zomato valet out 10 valet is not good. I ordered at night and the valet did not delivered me the order but I received the status saying it is delivered. And his phone was switched off. No way to contact that person.,3
"I am not able to select the team in your so called ZPL. In other devices it is selecting but in my MICROMAX CANVAS JUICE 2, the CONFIRM SELECTION button is not appearing. I could see the teams, I could see the select button but when I click on SELECT, nothing happens.",2
"pathetic service, faced issue twice in last five days...tried chat but no help.. tweeted as wrll but no response...i wish i could give zero star... i ordered food 2 hours back which was supposed to deliver by 10.29, i am writing this at 11.31 pm but food is yet ti be delivered, chat support says due to technical issue we are unable to check order pls check with restaurant, they don't pick up the phone. it a sorry state of affair. absolutely not recommended.",1
Chat with customer service doesnot work,2
"Bad experience with Zomato Payment Gateway. Today itself I had 2 Failed payment using Debit Card. 2 payments gone, but Gateway did not close properly, so amount struck for days now, 3rd time paid through Net Banking successful.Several times it happened earlier too.Zomato must find a better reliable Payment Gateway Partner",1
They have goood variety. But customer support doesn't really helps the customer. They charge you even when the rider is at mistake or the restaurant. I was delivered non vegetarian food and they didn't take any satisfactory step and didn't even give me some cashback or credits. Apologies alone don't work.,2
Zomato as a restaurant aggregator is doing amazing job. The restaurant list is huge which gives customers huge range of food choices. The service from Zomato itself is world class and can be called best of it's class. Happy to rate the app and service 5* Wish you the best in serving the foodies and your business.,5
Worst experience with first order. This app is cheating customers by charging Rs 50 as cancellation charges even for grocery items.,1
The zomato services have really deteriorated over the period of time...they take no ownership of any error from the restaurant....jus keep adding few credits to the account cant coverup their pathetic service. also their customer service is of no use n almost non existant when it comes to proving some solution!,1
"nice choices of restaurants. i just want to convey a message to the app makers that, they should simplyfy the interface and the opening home page. it is quite difficult to note small instructions, also use bigger fonts",4
"Very poor application developed , as well as cancellation charges applicable in case of late delivery, as 80000 rs scam has being happened by cyber criminals, provide a sms of customer care number on ordering the food. dont mention family history of delivery boy.try to improve the application more easy.as well as no offers like swiggy.",1
Worst app ever. NEVER delivers on time and when it delivers on time then the order is HALF EATEN. Even then Zomato had the gall to charge full amount!!! This happens with someone who is a GOLD USER. This app should shut down its customer DEFRAUDING shop altogether. The SERVICE is PATHETIC!!!,1
"i like the app and zomato service.. but onething i request the zomato , please provide multiple orders from multiple restaurants at the same time.. because so many people are like to order different items from different restaurant i.e like ice creams , soft drinks , milkshake, fresh juice and etc are not available from one restaurant. i hope the king zomato will b resolve this request as well as soon..",4
Delivery issues when your delivery partner received multiple order from different Costumers,1
I'm using your service every day from past few montsh.sometimes I feel good about you offers.sometimes your restaurant and cs are worst. on my recent order your cs executive tells me new terms stating app shows delivery time but once order is placed it shows preparing time. my order supposed to me delivered max 20-30/35 min but it was showing it will expected to be delivered after hour from my order placed...cs speak like thr are doing charity for us when we paid for servic as promised,2
On time thanku zomato,5
"Shows restaurants as closed when they are open for delivery themselves or Swiggy. Announces discount days and its not possible to order anything. Very poor customer orientation. Update....Nothing has changed. Partner restaurants don't entertain gold. And you are unable to resolve this. And me, the gold subscriber loses.",1
Not delivery on time,1
This is the worst app ever not even wanted to give it half star Whenever I go to order something it always shows that it can't accept the order . This app should be removed from play store .....Really disappointing app ...hated it.😡😡😡😠😠😠...... I dont understand what is the problem with this rubbish app every restaurant is closed for ordering .... plz dont waste your time on this app there are better apps available,1
"worst application and worst customer support, order cancelled by customer service and payment was not refunded. chat with us option was also worst, there is no option for proper communication. Amount which I paid for food, they said to me it is penalty of cancelation.",1
"Far better than others in market, Availability is great during peak hours, Like the new tamper proof packing. Good delivery timing too. Try to make the UI bit less clumsy, The bright colors in ad banners r confusing at times.",4
The service is soo good. Love u Zomato,5
"swiggy is the way to go. great options n so much more cheaper. was a fool to have given 5 star ratings. u charge so much for deliveries. at a nominal cost, I save atleast 1000 rs on swiggy odelivery. hell with u. swiggys restaurants are great providing awesome food and what a great discount. never pinches ur pocket. and what do I get from zomato? burning pockets. won't want to ever try u another time. happy v v happy to get rid of u. keep catering to the upwardly n see for how much it helps u.",1
Customer service and delivery service is really very bad... I hve ordered first food from Zomato and quickly removed it....after receiving it...,1
"Worst Experience. The estimated time showing was 25-30 mins and it took almost 2hrs to get that delivered, means if you order breakfast you will get that for lunch. Support is pathetic. They never reply or respond on the chat support.",1
"I didn't want to give a single star to this app. Everything about this app is good, but there is not a option to cancel a order. There should be an option for cancelation. Pathetic app. Wasted my money on it once.",1
"it is not helpful at all.. people behind this app are not responsible, they don't try to find a solution for the issue, they just try to put the mistake on u.. even the delivery guy he left the food on the security desk of the building where i work without notifying me, a Total disrespect, a very bad experience. same issue happened to me once with Talabat, they were very helpful, they gave me a solution and i went very happy..",1
very complicated app to find restaurants. most good places don't accept cards. lots of late deliveries however that restaurant doesn't change its delivery pattern inspite of zomato giving you few credit points. a lot of room for improvement.,2
Worst ordering experience ever. Losing UberEats and getting Zomato as a replacement is the worst ever replacement. Interface os designed in such a way that one tends to order without applying any promo. Moreover tax is changing every time from 18 rupees to 50 rupees on order of under 100 rupees. Once changing something on the cart is changing tax by huge amount. Moreover the stores which are already closed are not properly marked. Spending time ordering was a complete waste. Try swiggy instead,1
"The one + one free is not available anymore. I feel like i wasted my money. Plus when you get raw meat in your food. They just ask you for anther chance .... Like is there a standard to follow, or you just accept whatever you get?",1
"Apps customer support is very useless. Unable to get actions on time. Email is also taking time to get connected with the support agent.. Yet no one contacted from zomato. The resturant is ready for refund, but the customer team is not contacting.",1
"Running fake promise business. no customer support (useless chat system). delivering cold foods. trying to stop words by providing 20 zomato credits, which is annoying. I am not getting same for what I am paying. happened same for me repeatedly. such a reputation downfall. I spoke with delivery persons, because of multiple assignment for different location,they are not able deliver on time,, but support always says that only one order assingned and will be reach by 10 15 mins",1
Zomato is a great platform for all those people who love to visit new places and new restaurants. If shows the budget for two person with all the specialities of a particular place which makes it even more helpful.,5
The app was excellent until the latest update came and ruined everything. The concept of charging distance fee by incorrectly calculating the distance and cheating consumers. Hence from 5 stars to 1 star. Please take some action towards this.,1
"last time I ordered, half the items were missing. And the chat through app is designed in such a way that if we click something by mistake, there is no way of going back. All in all lost half my money. Never again.",1
"So, the delivery executives are advised to deliver food in the order they have received. Even if the second or the third order location is closer, the executive has to deliver the first. Maybe sometimes the executive has to go past one of his delivery location with the customers food but unable to deliver, because of this ridiculous rule by the company, like my case today. The traffic is horrible, the executives are on the road and I feel they know the easiest way out.",1
worst Application..today 12th may..i ordered at 8 50pm..money has been debited..and now its more than two hours..its showing me..sit back and relax...your order is still pending..we will confirm..zomato live chat support is more than that...i am only alone chatting on that live support..no one is replying.. worst i can ever experience from zomato,1
The app is biased. In the night it was showing me the expensive restaurants. Once i ordered then it shows me other restaurants that i normally order from. From what i can understand zomato wants to force customers to buy from their expensive restaurants that nobody is interested in.,1
"I have placed order for a cake today, tje delivery was late. I had opted for the option of timely delivery, but the tefund is denied saying address is changed. But I didn't change the address. This is unethical from Zomato. I suggest not opt for this option.",2
Very wrost delivery service and very much disappointed.They mentioned less time while ordering in app but after ordered it took so much time to deliver and customer care simply said sorry thereby getting irritated because I was in too hungry at that time. Need to improve lot and please mention true delivery timings in app.,1
"Zomato started to provide service within 30min or free but what happens is the delivery boy tick marks that food has been delivered even though it's not within the time, we as a human would not like to cut the hole in pocket of people who are working but sometimes it take more time than expected and there isn't any reply to our problem on chat it's all machine that replys.",2
"Worst customer service, degrade in quality of food, food delayed issue, no resolution for the solution..It was one of the best app when it was launched but later on turned out to be worst one.. I would have given this app zero star.",1
"Very poor response if the food that reach us is ruined. Even the cancellation charge that is being deducted is your full paid amount and you have to notice this by being quick. Because, cancellation can't be done if delayed. No help from team as well. Worst delivery app.",1
Poor service.. Dissatisfied.. Late delivery can be one.. Problems faced- 1st delivered wrong order 2nd customer service assured refund not for once but twice. But no sign of it even after 8 days. Don't download it ever. They fraud you. Will never get you refumd,1
"In earlier days Zomato service was good, but there is a drastic fall in Zomato customer care with sucess... Now they treat custmoers like beggers, who are searching for freebies. When I complatin about Hair in food, Stale and Missing Food Items in my past 3 Orders, customer care executives never did anything. Chat response is too delayed, No beep, whenever executive come back and reply to ur chat. So u get disconnected. It shows you many offer, even if the restaurant not delivering in your area.",1
"I placed an order with the offer code Zomato and had to make the payment online itself. After 25 mins, i recv call from Zomato that the order was unsuccessful and i have to place a new order. I informed them to place the order or to refund me the amt as this was the only amt i had in the bank but they refused it with no option available to me.On asking them for their complaint email, they denied and hung up. Later when i place the order thru my friends card the Zomato code offer was unavailable",1
"payment for my second order was deducted but order was not confirmed. when i order made payment for same items again, the owener called and said one item is not available. And when i asked for my first payment deduction he disconnected my call. worst behaviour. verry bad experience. so i wanted to give minus zero rating, but it was not there....huh.",1
"needs improvement. item ordered as per menu, but the same was not available with restaurant. which shows, menu is not updated regularly....due to which , amount paid got blocked for minimum period of 7 working days....",2
"1star as I have faced this problem n number of times that they deduct my money, deduct my credits and cancel the order due to payment failure etc.. this forces me to order again without credits and then wait 4-5days for my credit to be refunded. this is completely unacceptable as if my money can be deducted instantly then it should also refund instantly",1
Awful navigation system..Even after providing the correct addres the valet is always lost and then order is rejected saying that mentioned address was incorrect and after fighting for refund they make it sound like they have done a great deal of favour. Dissaponted.,1
"App is good it gives you great offersfor food,but the app crashes unnecessarily sometime order is directly placed without showing payment gateway and the delivery boy's location is not shown correctly. i only knew the order's reached when he called while the location of him was in the middle of nowhere.",3
They don't even confirm before deducting balance if you have money in paytm wallet. If you cancel your order then you have to pay full amount as cancellation charge . i don't understand what they think about it . If somebody is canceling the order it means you should deduct some part of the money not all . sometime they took 2 hrs for good delivery. Really Disappointed with their service.,1
"I used many months, This happen thrice to me. Customer experience is very very bad. Because of them my family struggled with hunger. Every one is hero until business is smooth run. Real ethics come when real hurdles come. My case is simple I order at 9Pm, not delivery till 9 30 , After followup got update for 30 min. I thought okay. Deliver guy is waiting at restaurant. But restaurant not able delivery food. After I several follow ups with Customer Care , Finally able to make them all thrice customer care, restaurant , Deliver boy in line and concluded that restaurant cant deliver food. 11Pm is happen. Customer care not giving me any clarity on canceling order. After all this conversation they simple said take 100 credit points as compensation. They are not understand the Hunger feeling. It is not simple one order. 8 members are waiting for it. Not yet all apology for to us. They rune my family happiness. Finally I decide never visit food apps, direct walk to restaurateur is easy and best way food.",1
"No COD option Recently i had placed an order, the restaurant did not have the food item that i had ordered, and it was informed to your delivery boy after they had already confirmed my order. Even though it was restaurant's fault, your delivery boy insisted that i cancel the order, so from that day you have removed COD option from my app.. unprofessional, learn from your competition, they have better customer support!",1
Today was my first home delivery order placed through zomato App after many years and we waited for almost 60minutes to receive dinner order.. It was supposed to be delivered at 9:44pm and food is received at 10:40pm...chatted with your chat bot but no response..restaurant number given in the app was continously busy....Finally searched restaurant no on Google and called them . Worst experience with first home delivery order... Never expected..,2
Worst customer service of all delivering apps. Waiting time is about 30 minutes and after that you get the usual response about passing the feedback to restaurant and sorry for the inconvenience. Nothing ever is done anything to improve service be it delivery or food quality or customer service. Haven't seen more pathetic and selfish way of business anywhere else.,1
I ordered but bymistec address wrong given.I did not get refunded even I cancelled my order,1
"Terrible Service .. I booked the order today 26 June 2019 .Payment done by Paytm. but order not dileverd, they said we tried to call you but your number going not reachable so we cancel your order and received amount we take as a cancellation fess. my number proper working.. they guys big cheater. don't book any order on zomato site. - Rating for Zomato",1
"There's never a time whenever I check, there's always surge fee and distance fee, too much taxes, and always costs much more than restaurants MRP. Even if you apply any coupon it hardly covers the taxes, most of the time even that is not covered.",1
Terrible experience. Uptil now therre was no provision of registering any id in your App. Todaay I placed order for alcohol and your app did not ask for any id. At delivery time the boy was asking for an id. I showed it but he refused to deliver. There is no place for id in my profile also. There is a bug in your app and you should fix it and also make provision for id in profile setting edit. A total waste of my valuable one hour arguing with your telephone executive who knows nothing. Rubbish,1
Worst experience ever. Can't even reach the support incase of a problem. The chat takes for ever to open and can't even reach them through the chat. I don't think I would ever prefer this app.,1
"No or very bad customer support . Everything is fine till the seller is delivering food. But if some issue occurs, these people dont help you. The issue just gets transferred from one executive to other. Pathetic services. Order only if you want to risk your money. There is no customer care number, and they dont pay heed to emails. If some body from zomato reads this , refer to Ticket id : 6150936 and 6134160.",1
"Finally! They prompt me to change the ratings. The service has still improved...but the delivery time needs to still reduced and the restaurant people should pay heed to customers need and do accordingly. Rest, their customer service is too good. I love ordering food through them! Love Zomato!♥️",5
"This app cancels the order and doesn't even refund the money. Don't use this app, use other apps like swiggy or ubereats. i have complained so many times but it always says that u will get ur refund in 3-5 business days, but i didn't get any refund yet.",1
"Good food, great prices. Fast delivery.zomato is doing great job. Need to make finding good restaurant easier. I recently found out that barbecue nation delivers as well.why didn't I know about it earlier?? Zomato needs to work on this.. every app needs to work on this actually. Peace",4
wish there was a o star available here..worst app they charged me penalty for cancwl the order which took 20mins for the restaurant guy to accept my order..as insisted by the delivery guy he cancel the order bcoz he told its gonna take more 120mins to food to be prepared..so Zomato wants me to wait 2hours for the food to deliver .,1
"The new upgrade that we got very bad, it does not show live tracking and contact details of the delivery executive. Even chat support is pathetic, limited options and they don't cover realtime issues that people may face.",1
The chat support is ridiculous. I asked them y my order is cancelled after getting prepared and they replied... your order is cancelled. Thank you for contacting . Stupid app....no regards to the time frames ...no calls or information regarding cancellation or declined orders....,1
"Chain of restaurants are not that great... Had to wait nearly 1 hour for an order which was supposed to be delivered in 20 to 30 mins. After waiting for an hour, still the order status was not updated. Hence, cancelled the order. very disappointed",1
"third class delivery process ... once they get the value they are free from every worry. A snacka takes 2 hours to reach, a person can die with hunger by that time. And they always sorry for the cause and try to improve as they are saying always but nothing on reality ... there is no option to give negative stars.",1
they are fooling peoples. Support service is very poor. There is no way to cancel order. If you request their support team to cancel the order then they took long time to reply you and in that way they can charge for cancellation.,1
"I have been trying to look for places that can deliver to my location but every time, regardless of the restaraunt, (given the exception of a few) it shows 'currently not taking orders' or 'does not deliver to your location'.",1
The food delivery is absolutely terrible. Riders don't show up with food. Money doesn't get refunded. And customer service is non existent. Best to browse for restaurants and order from Swiggy. Or wait for Swiggy to up its restaurant discovery game.,1
been using zomato since i was in the philippines and it never fail to satisfy my cravings. you might encounter some trouble with your order sometimes but its often not zomato's mistake. they'll do their very best to bring you your food faster and tastier.,5
"The interface needs some work. Food delivery charges bomb in terms of delivery charges. Definitely choose Swiggy for delivery. In addition, the review system is quite unattractive.",3
Offers like 50% off and 20% off are all fake and to attract customers and these coupons applied only if you pay online so that they can cancel your order and your time and money get wasted. They never send message that your money is refunded. Don't pay them advance or online.,1
"Pathetic service with an army of fake reviewers. I ordered some food from a restaurant which displayed 26 min delivery time.. the order never left the order even after 35 min with no notification/call from zomato... On raising the issue, order was cancelled with no explanation of what the actual issue was.. I can see so many 1 word reviews here.. most of these are fake profiles with no other reviews left by the person.. Never again with Zomato",1
Pathetic.. Today I have ordered the food from zomato. After 45 min waiting I have received the message that my order has been delivered. But I haven't received any order. I called delivery person but his number was switched off. Then I have reported this issue to help support and they were just said sorry. Please consider this as a exceptional case. We will refund ur money.. It was really very irresponsible behavior from zomato. Will never order food from this app.,1
i would have given a half star or no star.. app is non functional when it comes to add special instructions to your delivery guy. support desk is hopeless because they just apologize for an error with the app rather than fixing the matter.,1
"Trust me Zomato is one of the worst Apps I have ever used, 2 times I orderd and food never got delivered, they took my money and in app it is showing food delivered.The last order was for Dominos and I called Dominos they said Order was never placed with them, tried to contact Zomato but no response. I felt Zomato has started cheating people..I mean how can you have such a worst app and Customer support..I lost almost 700 bucks in total..Guys be aware, try some other apps..",1
Third class bunch of swindlers I thought they would have changed but the problems have gotten bad to worse. They will make a family wait for food for more than 3 hours and behind their back tell the partner order is cancelled. And go a step below by showing order was delivered. Now if all this mockery was not enough they refused to speak to customer when the restaurants manager insisted to do so. Their partner will deliver bad food and they wont replace it not refund money. 6/03/20 Still rotten,1
"What a low zomato has succumbed to. It's obvious that business isn't going well when they are resorting to daylight robbery. I received an incomplete order, and instead of refunding or even reimbursing me in the form of credits, they gave me a promo code worth lesser than the standard Zomato promo code. Complaining to support was useless, the poor support employees are pressured by utterly useless managers who are not allowed to talk to customers or escalate their concerns. Learn from swiggy!!",1
Very bad experience Charging for the product I cancelled timely. No one is responding properly chat executive suggested to send mail however no one is responding on mail and no one is providing resolution still waiting for resolution. Very bad now going to uninstall.,2
By mistake I made 2 orders for the same thing and I informed subway instantly and they said we won't prepare one of your orders but you'll have to report the same to zomato and as said I did so and discovered that the cancellation fee is the price of the whole order adding to it there is no option in Zomato app for the cancellation of order even the customer care guys are ill-mannered.,1
Worst food ordering app ever. There's not such thing called customer support and they've just given an email address for name sake which is dead I suppose. Payment issues to top it all and money getting debited from bank accounts when the ordered doesn't even gets placed. Please bring UberEats back.,1
"The price of items available on Zomato menus are not inclusive of GST, but when we visit the same restaurants, the same price is GST inclusive on their menu. Rectify all the menus ASAP, otherwise it's going to be one star only from this side.",1
Nice app bur it had personal charges in menu,5
This app needs a big update in this app many functions not working properly like live tracking clear availability of foods in REASTRAUNT and many others,3
"Very bad customer support. Firstly the order was delayed. Then when received, the food was not in edable conditon. The support was also worst. Reched out to zomato and got bad experience. I suggest to use other platform than this.",1
"when it comes to the administration, management and support from zomato, it is the Best. But some a times there are issues with the delivery boys who are not willing to come to the exact location and want us to come down. however many are good and we expect them to be polite. overall zomato u r doing good.",4
So exciting app with free soul of ordering food for our choice' restaurant and also the food is also good I am fully impressed by this app . I think that you will also enjoy this app. we can also get discount on our first five order.,5
why Zomato hotel & restaurants server is too busy it was very unsatisfiable to Zomato customer. its taking too much of time to find selected restaurant and make payment and delivery of order Beyond this thought's better to self pickup This app is too much of time taking process But if this problem is fixed by Zomato management it could be better,1
"The worst service I have ever seen. No service. Received wrong order. Waited for 12 min but no agent was assigned. Just here to loot people. Don't order anything. Even if they offer promo code, using promo code will be reflected in quality and quantity of item.",1
It takes the food over an hour to arrive even though the app says the food is on it's way. Zomato should change that feature on the app. It does not take an hour for the food to get delivered.,2
Most useless customer support and service. Was tolerating their nonsense for 3 years numerous screwups and issues. Dont use their service. They give offers just to cover their mistakes and purposely tell the restraunt to give less quality and quantity food. Go for Swiggy its much better. Waste of time and effort with these guys. DONT trust these guys ever again. And by the way iam not advertising for swiggy if you dont like swiggy as well eat hom food or order from some otherfood service provider,1
The worst app i ever seen i order food and paid also but they were not deleivered my order after 2 hours also and even the status of my order is not changed and when i call the zomoto costumer care then all the numbers shows out of reach and there is no option to call in zomato app there is only chat option but i got number from google and after sometime the status is change and when i got the no. Of dilivery boy i called him so he tell me to give extra 30 rs to diliver the food because he already go from my place and call me many time even i not received any call Overall it's worst,1
"Great app for food delivery anywhere at yhe doorstep. only once Delivery boy ahd screwed up while delivering food at the specified location. great place to find food and order. I avail the Offers most of the times, which makes me the usgae of this app more",5
Worst service.. I have placed order online through ZOMATO and the restaurant accepted the order but don't deliver the food even after waiting for 35 mins they still ask me to wait... And when trying to call the Restaurant their telephone don't work.. my personal advise.. if you are hungry and expect food delivery to home please avoid Zomato and Behrouz Biryani. My order time is 2238Hrs and it's 2353Hrs and no response from either Zomato or Behrouz.. only option Zomato have is to cancel my order,1
Poor customer care service. They have disabled chat service after complaining. They have deducted my money for not delivering the food from their end and they said they are helpless and can't revert my money back to me. I am going to raise it further to consumer forum.,1
The recent update to application acts stupid on receiving reviews. They say the review page will be active only for 10 mins after delivery. This review page includes review for the delivery boy as well the review for the food delivered. How can I review the food within 10 mins.? Do you expect us to eat our food within 10 mins of delivery.? Because of this odd functionality in the system the delivery personnel is missing the credibility we give them as a consumer.,1
I am happy with zomato 's service,5
"I would give it five stars if only they have the customer care part fixed. They take so long to respond! Other than that, this is the best food delivery app so far by comparison",4
"Worst experience ever...I ordered food and had been waiting for an hr and it was showing 5 mins away since then in the app to deliver. I contacted support executive, my order was cancelled without any notice and was informed by the restaurant that the zomato valet has picked the order but dint deliver. In the next attempt I ordered and was given incorrect order....Worst service I must say!!!",1
Many times offer doesn't work. On weekends it take too much time and very less option. Many times feel like conflict between zomato and restaurants because during weekends most of the restaurants are closed for delivery order. Kindly give offer after consulting and confidence of restaurants,4
gud nd fast delivery,1
Excellent Cuatomer Service,5
"Most of the restaurant and hotel don't disclose size or quantity of food they serve, I was many times cheated by meagre quantity for the money paid..can't update feed back on same. And also some people say so many number of pieces but it will be so small line peanut it should stop following g term relationship",1
i have worst experience with Zomato when i give ordered . they didn't give any response after 5-7 min they give notification that order not accepted automatically. so i feel bad and left page but after sometime when i checked my phone some another reason i saw order is on the way . but then i also left that place so i canceled food and now they apply panalty on me . it's not right that they accepted my order after 15-17 min without notice me and his customers care services very bad,1
Good food and fast delivery,5
Actually not even worthy for half star. Today ordered for one of my friend. The packaging was that much spoiled that you won't be able to eat. And there was no support at all. Neither rider nor the merchant accepted the fault. But I am accepting the fault that why did I ordered from Zomato. Pathetic service.,1
"Great application by Zomato. the sevice is swift and they are very customer focussed. Your bad experiences are treated like their own. They never trouble you for petty issues. If your food is not up to the mark, they follow up with restuarants as well. Zomato vallets are all humans, hence all different. I believe 99% of them belong to those providing us with quality services. Voted Preferred. :)",4
Not about the delivery person or restaurant. . They both are doing there jobs very well I suspect there is some problems on delivery partnera..till now it was awsome. . I have been ordering same burger from lione grill via swiggy from past 3 month every time I was satisfied.. . Yesterday also I had prob I received my order in 6 mins.. I suspected some thing is wrong I checked receipt it was mentioned that food picked time 10.06 pm but funny part was my delivery boy was at door at 10.02 pm,1
"The offering and ordering services are very good, but can you offer maps which does not lag, doesn't bounce my house from one place to another, doesn't show restaurant that it's closed but it isn't, it wastes time and efforts of the delivery boy too.",3
"An amazing application to order food😍 Its so easy to use and the delivery is done in an efficient way 👏🏼 Also, @ZOMATO team - please add the option to comment on the food we order along with the *star* rating method you have provided. Because sometimes we need to give a single or 5 star rating for a food and then its better if we have option to add comment so that its understood by the hotel owner and other users, thankyou !",5
"If the food quality is not good which is delivered then your money is gone no refund will be provided. Worst policy. They will ask for your order ID as if they are going to solve the issue but they will do nothing, simply faking. Bcz their main intention is to save the restaurans and not the customers",1
"Very pathetic experience. Their chat support sucks like hell. In between discussion, they hang up asking how helpful was this chat? They don't even complete the conversation, forget about helping with issue resolution. Three different stories from vendor, rider and zomato chat support. And absolutely no help.. big disappointment.",1
It is really a wonderful app it doesn't take much time to order food and it is simple to use for everyone And it's service is too good and their are so many offer and also so many options to choose for payment and they delivered your order so fast and all the delivery boys behavior is also too good I just love the app I recommend it to everyone of you frnds just go for it and install it,5
"Its been long time i have been noticing that zomato is getting worst in services,every time when i have ordered something it takes longer time than usual for food preparation,i think there are few more app like swiggy etc providing better services in shorter time.",1
"i placed an order on zomat at 9 pm the money transfer was successful, but the app.showed payment incomplete to which i contacted support and they said we are unable to.place order and the money will get refunded, but after 1 hrs 30 min suddenly the order gets accepted and i have been givem zero.support from.zomato. and my money got. cut and i recieved the prder after 2 hrs and i already had food till then , i need my money back and i am uninstalling this app and will tell everyone to uninstall",1
"I am writing this review on the basis of one my order placed on 5th July 2019. There were certain guest at my residence I placed order and paid in advance. unfortunately my phone got switched off When I charged my phone I got message that your order has been rejected because my phone was switched off. I spoke to customer care they said same what I mentioned, I replied you have address with you moreover its paid than why you would like to contact. They said nowcannot reattempt and nor wecan refund",1
I always face bad experience in this app Whenever I place order its shows location error and then sometimes when i place orders... from my account amt debited but order is not confirmed by restaurant.......then zomato support says amt will credited to ur account 5-7 business day...... My Ques..... if in my account there is Rs200only and i want to order of Rs 150 whatever....its show same error....amt debited but order not confirmed by restaurant... and my 150 stuked for 7day.....,1
"when I ordered the foods, its reaches me very late. because they always ask me address and always I have to explain them same address. That's it. so I am giving 4 star. If this issue will correct, I would like to give 5 star. anyways nice app n nice food 👌",4
now Zomato is charging more for delivery during peek hours. Now including 40% discount i have to pay 85rs.. irony is that i can get it directly from the restaurant for 90 without any discount lol.. so basically this 40% discount is bogus.. Ok uninstalling now.. delivery charges are half the price of dish not worth it..,1
"never ever ever ever order from Zomato.. they are fake..once the payment is done, it will show payment unsuccessfull. then after sometime order will be placed automatically and when you will try to cancel it..they will charge the whole amount as the cancellation charges..so nvr trust this app..Swiggy is far more better than this..",1
"No customer service at all , they don't care to reply in app's chat section and neither do they have any working customer care number. I ordered my dinner using net banking, money got deducted from my account but somehow the app showed ""Transaction got cancelled"". So basically I neither got the food nor the refund.",1
Taking a lot of time for the app to calculate charges and apply coupons. And coupons are fraud.. many times u dont get coupon applied.. waste and fraud app.. also the customer care is good for nothing.. they ask u whole lot of questions and last will ask u to mail the complaint..,1
It's too bad experience with zamato. I received late delivery by delivery boy and I communicated with Zomato chat service. I asked for late delivery and who is responsible for this. I believe that there is free delivery if order will deliver late. Zamato chat service replied like it's only applicable for OTOF. It's very untrusted service.,1
"I done online food after 2 hours I get the notification "" Your order cancelled "" Even my refund also not received.",1
Constant problem with payment,1
"Very bad experience with Zomato delivery. All the orders are prepaid and on when there is any issue they dont refund the money and simply say sorry and apologise, which is not acceptable. Nor do they have customer support system where you can talk.",2
"these days i'm liking zomato more coz of the recent changes in their business strategy, like eliminating fake reviews, floating lot of discount vouchers on app itself, live tracking etc. they have become more customer oriented than ever.last month i ve ordered from a newly opened restro, who took almost 1.5 hours to deliver the item..without me asking or complaning, zomato refunded the amount..earlier they were not so helpful but now i can see an immense change in their system.",5
"App is crashing, it only opened the first time. After that it's showing something is wrong please try again. Update: I don't wanna know how many different types of pasta are there or banana is a berry or not. Just make the app a bit faster or come out with lighter version of it. I am able to open youtube and playstore but not your app.",1
really bad experience. I ordered from sandhouse and no zomato valet has been assigned despite the fact that the order is ready from last 30mins and the restuarant is waiting for the person to pick it up and on top of it noone replies on chat service as well. pathetic experience.. WARNING:PLZ dont order from zomato as you might have to wait for your order for more than it commits. Better to go and pick on your own.😡😡😡,1
Pathetic if there is option to give rating in minus I would have done that. Poor customer service lyers frauds Order some frozen items they charged 55 Rs delivery for distance and received everything spilled all messed. Executive was not provided with any precaution like icebox or dry ice and they don't replace of refund . Don't use this app,1
"Worst service ever faced. I used it for the first time and after waiting for 90min my order got canceled. I called up the delivery boy, he was extremely rude. After that i called the customer service and they easily denied and at 10pm I was like what to do, what to eat. The customer service of Zomato shouldn't be called customer service because they dont listen you but they give there own explanation and question you. I called the customer executive instead of solving my problem he was arguing.",1
"Horrible customer service. Pathetic application. They have the same number for all the restaurants. And it is always busy or switched off. Kindly suggest you, to try a different app.",1
Good food with fast delivery ...I prefer every one to order your food here,5
Zomato is very much helpful for a person who is staying alone leaving his/her family far away. It helped me when I was not well. I couldn't walk out to have my food. Only Zomato was there at my door step during my unwellness. Thank you for bringing Zomato in Bhubaneswar City.,5
"Great app but 9 out of 10 times the driver's force a tip always state they have no change to get a 5 or 10 dh tip , which is unfair cause zomato already charges delivery fees . Raised this issue few times and nothing is done but a blunt bunch of fake apologies . So kindly hope management solves this issue in the near future",1
Nice app for foodies,5
"Different prices for different users!!! Having a monopoly in food delivery business, not only they applying excess surcharge, but also giving different rates for different users for same order. Zomato, really dissapointing that there is no regulation on pricing system. You are loosing customers trust.",2
"I neee to understand one thing, As a gold user i added few items in which one item is absolutely free and after calculating the taxes the total amount is 383/-. Then, i added the same items for a normal user and applied 'ZOMATO' coupon which is normal to any user and after the calculation the amount is 408/-. Here, just to save only 25/ why would a user buy the gold subscription for an amount 2200/-. Becase for the gold member the price of the items are higher w.r.t normal logged in user",1
they charge unnecessary penalties on cancelling the order in just seconds. also their agents on chat are unable to solve any type of query. also they sometimes cancel the order from their end after half an hour of order and just say sorry.,2
Its going down these days very bad customer friendly app. They have removed cash on delivery option. If you order and there is a problem then your money won't be refunded at all.,1
"Worst experience i have ever had, My order was placed and after 20 mins it was cancelled, neither they are refunding the money or they are letting me get other order, as discussed money will be refunded after 48 hrs. On top of it customer service is worst then anything.",1
its good but still have to...... improve discount coupon no need of ad if you provide discount for regular customer ...its will improve your customer and automatically mouth advertising for discount on every order get more + an its app already know to everyone just need more + mouth advertising,3
"The app is great for finding good restaurants and food delivery, sometimes you get great offers too. Removing one star as sometimes the app acts wierd and it says restaurant doesn't deliver to your address and then after sometime it works fine, otherwise great app!!!",4
"The new update has made the app really worst. The location service is really pathetic and the map is not at all correct, couldn't even find the famous landmark on the Zomato map. The Zomato valet and the customer is suffering due to wrong location..",1
Customer service sucks. No one bothers to answer chat messages. Food orders don't turn up. This has happened on more than 3 instances now. They are consistently poor on customer service. Hate it and do not recommend to anyone.,1
today I got 2 times rejections. I after all confirmation it shows that ur food is being prepared and within 1 hours I got a msg that your order is rejected due to some of ur food was not on restont. and I never trust on this app. Today 2 times I am having same problems and I also used 2 offers waste 40%off in These orders,1
This is a waste and useless app I order my food on daily basis with the app and just fr once I ordered something and cancelled it in 2mins and they bloody charged me 300 while went to the chat line they showed me waiting time of 1min and I'm getting a reply in 4 or 5mins one reply no proper customer service just lk dat b/w ppl wish u hey they don't do anything useless app will never use this again and would recommend others nt to use especially my family and frndz,1
It's really an excellent app. The offers that you get from them is amazing. Zomato gold is worth a buy. They give a free dish on every delivery on selected restaurants also. Lots of amazing offers that saves up a lot of money for you.,5
Very bad experience. Cancelling the order when not able to deliver the food and in ads they show free delivery if not able to delivery on time but it's all fake. Don't waste your precious time to install this type of fake app. Thank you,1
"Orders placed with clear cooking instructions are never followed few time we ignore if it's not going to bother but when it's for a sick person and cooking instructions are not clearly followed it is utter disgusting.. and on top they don't even rectify the mistake neither do they redo the order again .. no value for the customers time ,money , efforts, neither do they realize the importance of it",1
"I think the handling of the app is a bit difficult,but afterwards you get used to it.Other than that,No problem!This app is great and also,Keep Up The Good Work!👍",5
Editing My review. Ordered with kfc at 1.46pm I was supposed to receive at 2.15pm its 2.30pm now and nothing has come. The app asks to rate the driver before even it has arrived. Previously was good but now it has really disappointed. M hungry and I paid online so I can't even cancel. I called the main office and I was told don't worry about my order. Very disappointing,2
"Very bad. Today (14th Aug 19) at 2:30 pm I ordered an item. payment also done. while ordering they shown 30 min delivery. Now time around 3:20 pm, I am not received the item, Hotel people also not responding while my call. It is my first & Last oder. will not recommend to anybody. Poor App!!",1
"0-star. I didnt recieved an order and delivery boy marked order delivered. and when i tried to get support, getting very slow response over chat. And they couldnt resolve the issue, even after 2 hrs of booking. Another guy called from Al- bek restaurant and he was talking like i had done something wrong.",1
"So far it's been a positive experience.. good, light API.. which is a huge plus.. only one thing try not to order dominos thru Zomato.. almost every time Dominos goofs up and they don't give their 30 minutes guaranteed delivery as well .",5
It's fast and free delivery super ya,5
"Worst experience,.. Maximum times after placing the order they will give you a call after 1/2hr that the restaurant is closed or the location is too far, etc. In addition they ask you to pay online and delays in refunding the amount......",1
I just ordered food and delivery guy doesn't find the address so i contact to customer support he just said if you cancel oder now you will take full charge.....waao it all our fault or just a fraud are you gyus are doing🤐🤐🤐😑there will be no more delivery from zomato,1
Arriving in timer glitch..if order is supposed to get delivered in 30 mins...the timer has to be for 30 mins...you cant keep extending the timer until your order is delivered..it doesnt make sense. The wait time has to be definite!,3
First of all listen me properly Zomato has to give gps location as your map couldn't find most of the house which are in range of zomato orders.... and many of your delivery boys couldn't find the location .. this is not their problem. You should give order to those delivery boys who are from that area ...,1
"I am totally upset with your selection of restaurants. The last order from foodies was pathetic. In fact I do not have a worst word for the quality of food in my vocabulary. Paneer quality was worst possible,it was just like chewing gum with oil all-around the dish. worst taste. In fact I don't want to give any star.",1
Well this review is only for some Gold restaurants. A few restaurants had kept separate menu for zomato gold and a few have some or the other terms and conditions for gold specials. I suggest zomato better to take these restaurants off gold completely than to get surpirses when we reach there. Keep limited but with clear policy and no hidden tnc.,1
worst experience with customer support .. don't even have voice assistance for customers .. everything deals with chat .. .. Also showing the food items which are not available from the hotel and accepting the orders and payment without letting the customer to know that whether the food is available or not ..,1
"Horrible customer support, if something is wrong with your order your money is as good as wasted. The only remedy is to write a email to their support team (automated machine response) . Far better customer support given by swiggy and other rivals.",2
"Worst app for food delivery. Even IRCTC ticket booking app is more reliable. On every next page it displays a message ""something went wrong"". Took 50 mins to deliver order. I am immediately uninstalling the app.",1
App not good. does not show restaurant location while ordering which might have helped in choosing nearby restaurants. Also does not show actual reviews by customers. just shows average points which is not helpful and could be rigged.,2
"worst ever service. i wish i could rate this application at -5 stars. No proper service is given to customer while contacting them. Not even a single number of zomato customer care is proper. everytime i call it always tells that this number does not exist. i have written plenty of emails to zomato, but i dint get any respond or any replies from them . Its the worst service i hav ever seeen... i hope this feedback reaches u and u guys reply me soon.i dont trust this app anymore. remove this app",1
total waste of time . no proper customer solution. swiggy and uber eats is best. they also increase price for the same thing and later they give discount on higher prices which is also not good. their delivery is also late every time. good thing is their discount deals .,1
"Good service, good support. But I suggest you to have a scheme like swiggy super where they wave delivery charges. At times that seems to be more economical. It's true tat it's number game but I felt at times swiggy is cheaper",5
"I know it is very easy to get disappointed. But for all future deliveries, I would like the Zomato Team to remind the each and every delivery boy to ask the customers of add on items every time they arrived, instead of just delivering and rushing off.",4
"What a pathetic app. I didn't even get what I ordered. When I complaint to zomato they did not even reply to my messages. They kept me waiting. Finally they replies saying hope your issue was resolved! What! Who would have resolved my order, when you didn't even replied. Boycott zomato.",1
"The app is associated with good places to eat. Apart from a few disappointing experiences with the restaurants, the app itself is quite good. Recently their customer support has also improved a lot and responses are quick and helpful.",4
This is the worst app I've ever used two times they have sent me wrong or missing items and dint even pay for the inconvenience. Never use it anyone. Worst app,1
Totally dissapointed to tell that in apl support is the worst. I had ordered a pizza with extra toppings and add ons. But they had delivered a basic medium pizza which wasn't the pizza that I ordered. Had to pay extra and support team is not helping with raising the issue as well and there is no response to mail sent 30 hrs ago also.,1
its a nice app for delivery but some times they try to cheat. some times they kept offers and they denied to give those at the time of ordering the offer is valid but if order is placed they ask the whole cost to be paid swiggy is little better than this in fast delivery and offers from more hotels,3
Gold subs sometines is not useful as restaurants refuse to provide the offer even when they are listed in gold 1+1 offer. Now this uograde to Z pro from Z gold is also misleading. We bought subs for 1+1 and neitger the new offer is close to prev one. Also most of the tine we dont have any images of the food from the restaurants. It woukd be better to have pics of dishes atleast 60% of all,1
The order reached after 1 hr i think he has changed the product i had to order it again,1
i think that this app is good. & i think that video clip of zomato which was trending that the delivery boy who had removed food & was eating was planned. i don't think anyone would do so . & if that person has done also it was because he was hungry so please don't blame the app 😊😊 enjoy ordering & keep eating with a smile 😀😀😀,5
"I ordered from dominos through zomato from Nagpur. The order is assigned to dominos, Nanded, Mumbai. How can this app show wrong location like this? This is extreme irresponsibility. If you cannot use proper location, GPS services.. what is the use? Zomato app is a total disaster in detecting the current location.",1
Uber eats should have acquired Zomato. Or atleast zomato should use ubereats code base. Zomato search for a dish is pathetic and vice versa ubereats was awesome! In zomato if you search for dish ex Kaleji - it doesn't show dish with hotel and it's offers. It will show dishes or hotel names.... If you open those hotel menu dish is missing in them.... Pathetic experience... Finally couldn't find dish and ultimately didn't ordered from it.,1
"Worst app i had ever used. I had ordered from a restaurant of 418₹ and upon realising that i can order something more good for the same amount, when i cancel that order they took all the money as a cancelation fees. And not returned a single penny.",1
"Don't order food from here. They don't think about customer, they only think about restaurant because they are getting money from them. They are least bother about customers. Going to delete this app. Its better to order from different app or go outside and eat.",1
"I love this app and their services also, but i do not like the unnecessary delivery charges applied for the very nearest resturants which hardly hardly took 5 minutes to reach. For such deliveries i have to pay 30 bucks extra .",4
"Lately the customer service quality has deteriorated to an unbelievable low. Orders being cancelled by the Zomato valet, no response on Zomato support, orders being delivered two hours after being placed and the list goes on. To imagine such outrageous service being given to a Zomato gold member. I have started to reconsider my choice of food delivery app. In this time of competition and market crunch your sales team needs to really step up your game else Zomato will lose valuable customers.",1
ordered 3 items out of wich only 2 reached me.. when called the rider he told he is not responsible complaint it in app.. went to chat window it shows a time which goes on incresing no reaponse . finally mailed after 7 conversation they agreed to make the amount credit in my zomoto account.. it hs been 2 days after the mail came but no money is credited... fyi: this was my first order... first order itself too disappointed,1
Had to place order twice...payment made first time itself but order not forwarded and placed by zomato with the restaurant. As such had to place order second time again and had to pay again which was more than the discount on first time. No support from customer care also.,1
No issues to report as of now...,5
"please remove donate tab , i don't want waste my money , i alredy donated money by mistake while ordering food , you guys are clever i didn't know that donation was included in my order 😡 as a customer i want good services not your drama of being good",3
"Hi Zomato, i have very bitter experience with your service. Since last 3 orders i am not geting the food on time and nobody is responding in the sence neither from Zomato nor the pickup body nor the restaurant. The biggest problem is without restaurant number verification how zomato is registering restaurant. Almost 1 hr waiting for the food still no communication.",1
"one of the worst services, kept forfeited full order value in the name of cancellation even though the same was done through the delivery person.worst services. Robbery sort of case.worst response by customer care,not at all customer centric services.very worst. thanks for your response AT LEAST ,i have already sent the e mail explaining the concern the SAME DAY. however NO RESPONSE is given yet on the same.",1
Very poor service no help line to call zomato if you have trouble in getting your food in time only chat option is available and reply is horrible. I ordered my food at 1 PM and it was delivered after 2 hours at 3 PM on chat the support was poor they were not able to track my order number,1
"Disgusted and disappointed by the service of the chat support(the name is ironical), not much of a support. Happened more than thrice. If play store had an option for giving half a star as rating then I won't even give zomato that.",1
"order cancellation charge is equal to order amount even in immediate cancellation, even if you request them to go through with the order they will ask you place a fresh order despite the fact that their excuse for not giving refund is that the food has already started being prepared.",1
I really needed help navigating gold membership while I was waiting at a restaurant and I waited for 20 mins for the support team to respond but there was no response. Shockingly I had this terrible experience after I just paid for gold.,1
"Good service, but many of restaurants rates are showing more than menu cards. e.g. Mamledar Misal has rate 56 but some Franchise shows 65 some of 70 and some times 90 too. need to make sure rates are also part of quality. Increasing delivery rates is also gone be customer's issue in future😏",4
"i ordered from fresh menu, my order was denied without my knowledge, i kept on waiting for my food and there is no option to cancel.my order, im not getting a refund and nobody to contact .i tried the pathetic chat option you have and nobody is responding. worst service i have eber received and even worse customer service...this is unacceptable... didn't know you need to steal money from people to support your app. why are you scamming people ? good luck you just lost another customer",1
"food and service are good generally except one or two bad experiences. Generally these delivery apps give huge offers at starting to attract customers but when reached certain heights forget about their customers and fall into losses, I don't want Zomato to be like that.",4
its nice but sometimes it its irritating as it removes some of the restaurant from delivery (temporary) . saying currently the restaurant is not delivering at that place instead they are. this problem should be seen.,5
"Till now I am getting what I want as per my budget,apart from it do work on sections like breakfast ,lunch and dinner so that users get more options to choose without wasting time on single touch.Also work on end service improvement like better packaging ,quantity along with quality.Sometimes what I observed the delivery boys bring d ordered items openly from the restaurants and can you imagine how the quality would while reaching my door.And plzz also improve the quantity too.Keep working",4
Worst account security measures. Can't do anything to ensure there is no unwanted access to my account.,1
According to the new update . I donot like the UX too much . it has become more complicated and is not an app many Elder people would be able to use . the UI/UX for an app like this should target All kinds of audiences .,4
Good App for ordering... but discount is not always real discount....some restaurants if you see menu card price is bit lower than after discount price. NOT sure whether its restaurants trick or zomato's. Recent update UI is good but there is treasure hunt to find call information,3
"very bad cancellation policy. not deserver even 1star for customers support facility. my order was running 1 and half hour, i had contact and char with zomato to cancel my order and refund my money back as the order is running 1 and half hour late. they just ignore me and not responding to any my message",1
"Excellent food service it could be better if we get better offers and also when we really need any food that restaurant will be like ""currently we do not accept any orders"" .. That's the sad part or else everything is awesome😍👌",5
Its ok app. Not always we get what we want but then ok once in a while we can use this app. Cost is the one matters most of the time. You never get the cost that u expect. Its an average app.,2
Zomoto giving best service for food delivery. App is working fine. But I want add one point like restaurant people are not serving quality food on online delivery... A specially zomato. They are reducing the quantity and quality while booking through zomato.,5
"Hi zomato team, it's been 3 days post my restaurant is live on zomato but still it is not visible on your home page as it is hampering a Business lot,moreover no service manager has been assigned neither no call from your end.i have wrote numerous mails but no reply from your end. Please explain this kind of service you are giving to restaurant partner ?",1
Very un intresting UI and it seems like a copy of zomato. Though responses are fast but still the application is broken from many aspects . So sorry can't order from this mis behaving app. And guys please make sure the senstive data like payment should not be breached. Else consumer court is always there to help us.,2
waited for one hour and the delivery boy could not locate my address. after that notification came as food has been delivered. I have not got any refund as well since I have paid the bill using Google pay. Zomato really sucks and there customer service.,1
"Worst experience with the zomato. I will never ever use this app for ordering food. Within a minute of after placing the order they are refuse to cancel my order. Even when i had discussion with customer service, they suggested me to cancel oder without getting any refund. Horrible experience.",1
This app has charged cancellation fees for the order declined by the restaurant for the food we dint receive. The reason given was call not reachable that's simply not acceptable. Had a good opinion on this app now absolutely not satisfactory. Uninstalled the app for such an invalid reason.,1
"experiencing same restaurants with a lot of improvement just because of zomato. proper packing, tissue, paper plates everything which is required with that meal for which we have to ask restaurants every time in past. most important all these facilities with no cost even paying less than before..",5
My overall experience was ok with zomato. But yesterday Zomato wallet didn't even call me nor he visited my home and they said we did many calls to you so we cancelled the order. Each and every detail was clearly mention in my address. It's Impossible that he didn't find my address. My money was deducted from my accont i didn't get my order. Nor any refund from zomato. Uninstalling this app. Done with their looting policies.,1
worst app. they don't value customers time. if you have ordered the food no matter how late it gets but you cant cancel the order. and even if their valet is not able to locate the address in a sector of city like Chandigarh then that is also customer's fault.,1
Now days very poor service,1
Doesn't fail to disappoint... Zero care for customers. Restaurants serving worms in good are still on their list and high on rating and even after several discussions they haven't taken action against it. Please don't trust this app if you want to be safe and healthy,1
"Zomato software is not working properly I guess.when I ordered my food I missed to apply the promo code so there was one option as ""Chat with us"" and inside that ""promocode if not applied "" .After that zomato customer care told you cant apply the promocode after u have placed the order.If i cant apply then why u have put that option in the list.if the option is enabled after placing the order and if you are not giving the option then the option is waste only.so please remove that.",1
there is no control over the delivery time defaults by some restaurant. further there is barely anything done for the costumers as there is no option to cancel even if the restaurant doesn't deliver on time.,1
This zomato is suck really...i ordered the cake on 3pm and wanted it to reach me by 4pm. The app was showing 5:15pm. It never takes too long to make a cake. What wrong was i expecting? Tell me. My friend had to leave office by 4pm for her home and then i search for the support or customer support number so that i could call you and ask for minimizing the time and deliver my order early but there was no number available as this is app. Why you people don't have any customer care number tell me...,1
Some of the store refuse to accept or decline order at times with no reason and explanation but there are times that they accept it. There should be field where we can give a location map so for easy tracking of delivery address.,3
though all apps give u discounts and all. But always its nt about discount. Its about services one should provide. Zomato provides best services. the only app who gives number of both service provider and delivery boy nt only that they help us in paying methods as well. i register with other number and use paytm with another number but its never creats problem for me on this app. other apps only allow register number. 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗,5
"Uninstalling the app.. Horrible customer support, you write a mail, you drop reminders, even comment on FB (in that case your order id will be asked and nothing onwards), no grievance redressal system.. nothing.. you play bet on your money in order to pay before you order so that you can get benefit of certain coupon. If your order is incomplete or doesn't arrive you, you simply just lose your money. Pathetic customer service..",1
"worst service and denying to accept their mistake of the order given. A bug was inside the food. Moreover when i talked to the customer care, i was told that quality and quantity depends on the restaurant and zomato is helpless in it. This is what i expect from these type of apps.",1
This app is very helpful but the only drawback is they offer you discount and then they add tax charges and delivery charges. Which eventually comes out to the same price as before.Rest this app is very user friendly.,4
"Very very poor delivery timing and I ordered just 0.3 km , I received after an hour... worst and you have aquired uber to.. better prioritize near by order and than farest location.. don't even recommend others... poor timing and I ordered by 12:10 PM yet to receive my order..",1
"Extremely poor service they are rendering to customers of New Delhi. Two consecutive orders of mine got cancelled. No refund within 48 hours even after paying via Google pay. No compensation for any of them. It says it provides service 24x7, but at late nights delivery boys refuse to deliver foods. Extremely disappointing!",1
This app is very helpful to choose restaurant around you the ratings are really and helps you to make better decisions for your nightouts Zomato Gold is really good gives the best offers the one problem in this is when order your food it doesn't show the the proper exact location of the delivery and dnt show the total price after they accept the order.this app is the best but some improvement overall the experience is good👍,3
Its worst...it needs 2 otp ..mobile no then email..bakwasssss,1
Payment was deducted from my account but hasn't generated a transaction number. The chat box with customer service doesn't show letters to type our concern. There is no phone number or any other means to contact these people. Feel like i have been conned Big Time.,1
"This app sucks after the new update. I'm not talking about the service, but the networks. Whenever I try to open it it keeps showing network error even though my network is perfect. Seriously now FIX IT",1
"Delivery is invariably delayed when ordering via zomato, specially in Doha. Talabat is costlier but delivers on time. plus tracking is available after the food leaves the restaurant. Repent decision ordering via zomato, especially when you need the order delivery quickly. estimated delivery times have no sanctity at all. To make matters worse, zomato chat is un unresponsive today",1
Experiencing new zomato version...superb handling but still focus on offers coupon. The food cost of other apps is good than yours.Previously I used it but I experienced lack of service but now its one of the best food delivering app but focus on cost!!,2
"Hello, no one seems to check your feedback log and also your chat seems to be off. Your drivers who sit at Yin Yang in JLT are disturbing. Even with closed windows, their chitchats until late at night is very audible. I am a resident in that cluster, I have written to the restaurant and the building security but it's still happening since Ramadan started. Please do something about it. Would really appreciate it.",4
"Easy to search and filter, quick delivery of food. Please provide the option to edit the rating anytime. Once unknowingly my baby gave rating 1 but it was actually 5 star rated delivery. Also provide comment box for feedback, some hotels are providing wrong items. We don't have any place mention it.",4
Worst customer service ever. They don't do a thing about your complaint all they do is giving an apology and if you push them a bit more all they will say to connect with them through email and on email they will take tym around 48 hrs. And still they will not have any kinda resolve to your complaint.,1
"The app support is great,better than all the food delivery app,you can cancel the order without paying extra,you get lot of offers and also refund when food is not upto mark.",5
Worst experience with the app. I ordered the food but due to some emergency not able to collect it. But did not get any refund. Don't order any food through this app as you will get any refund.,1
"The quantity of food I received was very less so I complain about this and they replied me that they will response to my query within 48 hours and theyhaven't and today I again complain about the inconvenience they said it's too late.I mean what is this,it's you who is late not me, I complained on the same day I received the food,then they said they will give me promo's for the this and they haven't, so I again contacted them and they told me that we haven't promised you.What do you mean by this?",5
Extremely bad. It is the 3rd time that the order is accepted by the restaurant and I am still waiting for delivery 30 minutes late than delivery time. The chat in the app not working. Lunch time wasted. Really disappointed,1
This app is sucks huge after choosing my order when i select the payment option this app didnt progress to complete the order and keep processing for infinity please improve the app last night i have to waited so long to place the order but it wont let me after losing the battle with this app i chose to use different app highly disappointed .,1
"Have had good and bad experiences with zomato, usually the good ones. they have added a lot of features and food discounts are great. bad things happen and they are atriving to give a good customer experience. overall a good app for food delivery, restaurant recommendations and more. all the best zomato !",4
"wrost application, always provide a poor service, never have a solution to improve the service. Even sometimes cancel the order without informing. if you never have a solutions then why you are here, just close it down.",1
"Worst support and bad service, don't ever use Zomato food for order.",1
Due to the valet strike I didn't get my order.they made me wait for about 2 hours. And now I can't order because all the shops are closed. Very bad experience using this app. They made me feel ashamed in front of my guests,1
"Delivery prives have gotten ridiculously high in the last few months. Nowadays, there is no proper customer support either. It's better placing the order directly to the restaurant rather than going though Zomato. Utterly disappointed. The quality that helped Zomato gain prominence is now officially lost.",2
"estimated time of delivery should be given after placing order. i cant chat wid support , no option given to reply... first i used to think of it as a gr8 app but nw i think its a dark pattern app(one which wont let u cancel or chat if problem is from there side)",1
"Worst experience with zomato gold, trust me you will get better offer without gold. And irony is year subscription is just waste of money. They say 1+1 food per month and the same you will get it in normal zomato at 50% off. For your information I have two screenshot of same food items with and without zomato gold. The strange and shocking info is normal zomato is cheaper than zomato gold. Most stupidest thing I have ever faced in my life. Successfully wasted money on Zomato gold.",1
"I was placing one order for which actual price was 169 but app showed offer price 150 when I added that to cart it's price went up to 169 again. stop fooling customers like this. Not every one pays attention to the grand total breakdown so please stop looting people's money. At least have basic decency to charge them honestly.. extremely shocked to see this from you people, expected far better from you guys. I hope you will look into this issue and may be then I can change my ratings",2
I had very bad experience. Simply zomato cancelled my order and going to refund and the reason they are telling that the restaurant didn't accept order but I called the restaurant and booked my food. If the restaurant didn't accept in system then zomato people should call the restaurant and check thr status instead_of simply cancel the order. It looks zomato system has problem because of that I missed my breakfast . I understood that for urgency zomato will not be useful and helpful.,1
Sometime back I had mentioned that Zomato is going south due to my bad experience using the app. Today after almost 5 months I have ordered again through Zomato and it was seamless. Did not have any glitch or any confusion. Thanks for the wonderful experience. Hope it will be the same everytime in future too.,4
"Don't ever order the food with them they don't value customer ,this is my experience. I ordered a cake online but forgot to place the delivery time for delivery then I realized after placing the order and contacted to the restaurant and then zomato & asked help they informed they are unable to modify the time.I simply asked to cancel this order and I will replace the order with the correct information but executive rejected the offer informing they will cancel the order but don't pay the amount.",1
"Third third class . Swiggy is best. Zomato is very very bad. No customer support, order delivered very very late. Sometimes order missed. No refund from Zomato. Be careful.",1
Very Bad experience. Two times i faced problem regarding the order. Once i didn't received full order and another time wrong order was delivered. And no action was taken for the wrong order i received. No refund of money or discount was given when i got wrong order.,1
"Zomato only adds problems to the food ordering experience by its total lack of accountability for troubleshooting issues with food, delivery, and delays. Either use Swiggy or just order directly from the restaurants' websites, both platforms are way more supportive and accountable.",1
Would like it if u ramp up more locations for late night deliveries,5
"Poor, Pathetic, Insensitive, Fraudsters, Unprofessional and a big time liers!!! I am actually short of words and you don't need to be einstein to understand what kinda of experience (s) I had with them. They always charge you bomb for delivery and charges & never ever deliver on time and on top of that their menu has a discrepancy with actual menu of the restaurant. Their customer service sucks big timeThey are simply cheating and looting customers and this should be reported by every customer.",1
"Worst idiotic app, firstly the price of food is not a little high from actual price its extremely high from original price ,secondly if u are getting a good deal and try to apply promo code ZOMATONEW then it will say try another promo code, because u r getting a good deal and how can this stupid app will give u a good deal and the last thing restraunts charge almost 35-40 rs whenever u r getting a good deal they are just trying to make u fool never order from this idiotic app instead go forswiggy",1
"I have ordered the food 2 times, and both the times even after accepting the order for the same delivery address the Zomato boys have cancelled the order.... If someone is hungry and is counting on your app than..... Zomato experience was truly bad.... There are more good apps..",1
"My order often gets cancelled due various reasons. Sometimes it's okay, but if it gets cancelled in every 2nd, or 3rd order, then, it's irritating. You wait for your order but after waiting for 30-60 mints, it doesn't arrive and gets cancelled. This is the thing I don't like about Zomato.",3
"I have observed that all the items available at various food joints are not included in your App's menu. For example , roasted chicken available at Al-Kareem is not included in your menu. Otherwise the experience is very good.",4
"The app is great.. But when the vallet makes the mistake or the restaurant even so the money is cut from our accounts, also the vallets call the customers without even trying to look through the navigation, I mean we are providing the app with correct location then why does the vallet needs to call me on my personal no. And talk for no reason?",3
Cheap advertisement and cheap your management too you are use public private data use in commercial.,2
Wrost app ever.there is no any solution for the customer who got spoiled food.do mail and mail and mail continuously but there is no any solution no any listening for customer..never recommend this app to order food.third class app even not able to get single star.very very bad experience.customer support team is zero.please do not order from this app.,1
Not worth using it . Its better you choose any other food delivery app because this app is fooling you by displaying very high price. Recently ordered the food from the restaurant i had food once. i ordered from the same restaurant prices were 200% high. please leave this app now.,1
"Very bad experience with the app and with the chat support team. After explaining the whole issue story, also shared the error screen shots. Now they are starting from beginning asking what is the issue.",1
"Poor delivery service, poor customer service, a bad experience. Ordered some dinner at curefit 40 mins away from my home(@7.34 PM). Called the guy( @8.36 PM) since I received a message (@8.34 PM) that the delivery person is unable to contact me. I didn't recive any missed call.The delivery guy told that the order is cancelled. The chat centre people very rudely mentioned that since I didn't recieve the call the order was cancelled. I have all the screenshots. They are not ready to listen 2 me.",1
"Worst customer service. The delivery guy delivered the food 1hours and 30 minutes late from the expected time. He was roaming somewhere and wasn't even close to the location. Instead of cancelling the order or rising a complaint, i guided him to my location. My location and address was correct. But when this guys reached he started shouting at me. I should be shouting at him for getting me cold food. What kinda behaviour is this? I didn't this kinda customer service from a reputed company like zo",1
"Pathetic. Initially it may be ok to New customers. But once in trouble with any order, keep banging your head with customer care chat! No solution. Gold membership is scandal and non refundable if you are dissatisfied. Just uninstall zomato... it's not worth even the mobile memory space.",1
the app has lost its simplicity. it has become very hard to place orders. finding relevant information has become difficult. why have they made the user interface so difficult to use?,2
"Worst food delivery app. Restaurant associated with zomato always give poor service, doesn't deliver on time, always late atleast by 30minutes. I have faced simillar situation not only once but many times and the worst part is the customer care of zomato which don't provide any solutions to you just says I can understand you I am going to delete this app Swiggy is far far better",1
Very very poor service,1
"App is good. Just wanted to comment on the ZOMATO gold to pro so called upgrade. That is actually a downgrade. They have taken off the Buy 1 Get 1 offers and added 10-25% off and are claiming as an upgrade...not sure from which angle. Zomato might think this as a strategy, but customers who bought the gold memberships usually sees this as cheating. Amazon food is in for the competition now. Let's see.",1
Order was accepted but was cancelled half an hour later due to the unavailability of someone to deliver. They should've at least informed before hand so that I could've ordered somewhere else. Update: this has happened twice so far.,1
Pretty bad experience with zomato every time. None of the restaurants accept the orders soon. And zomato chat service is pretty useless. Your messages are read only after 20min and after that too they wont respond. [Same condition even now] not even 1% improvement.,1
Pathetic experience for such a big brand. Again and again they find it difficult to find a valet to deliver my food. Two to three times its okay on a random occasion but they have made it a habit and there is no improvement in the customer service from their side. Uninstalling your app.,1
The food was great. the delivery was before time . the only thing i would complain is the food cost is shown higher than the restaurants actual menu. this is not fair.,2
"worst experience! order got placed without any confirmation from my end. It never asked my confirmation, the order placed automatically while checking the options. It didn't allow you cancel or make the changes. Extremely disappointed, vl delete the app once I take this delivery.",1
i think it's the best food delivery app i've ever used. great features in app for rate restaurant nd comments. And it has also a great support staff who listen you sincerely and resolve your issue correctly. Great and with a great mindset. keep manage this service and dont let it down. i m happy to rate nd review you.,5
Always late in delivering. I've been using this app for my food orders but no more. Contact customer care and they don't help at all. They always tell you to contact the restaurant. Totally disappointed.,1
chat system is useless. they just send the zomato email for every problem and then they don't reply to your mails. there is no customer care number for so called big company. there coupons are applied but never give full eligible credit for the coupon.,1
"I already miss uber eats. Zomato support is so much worse that it's not even funny. I asked to cancel an order 10 seconds after I placed it and the agent put didn't reply for 10 minutes, the told me it's too late. Zomato gold is an absolute scam where they now cap all your purchases and is used as an offset to make sure you order small meals or else you overpay. I'll be using swiggy from now I guess, not using this service.",1
"Now zomato sucks... People can't pay cash above 700/- .. and discount on private banks only.. no SBI, BOI.. it's time to uninstall it..",2
"don't use this app to order food, i have ordered food and I got half what I ordered and some apologies. there is no proper customer care support. I tried reaching them several times but no proper response. very very very disappointing",1
Good service during this Covid situation,5
I ordered i paid the amount online i waited and after 30 min approx and got message that your order is cancelled due to no rider assigned great late at night and no option to cook any food great service keep it up! Zomato and in return got 54 rs discount voucher and no option to reorder as the long chat led to the closing of the restaurant .,1
"Zomato has been the best since years. It always has the coupon section at checkout, unlike others, where they hide coupons. Also, it's hassle free, does what it says. The customer services are great too! Keep it up zomato! Zumm.",5
"I like this app, this gives genuine idea of the restaurant but my level is not visible in the app, which I have asked a number of times to check and resolve but till date I have not received any permanent solution.",4
"No customer service, no resolution on complaints. Waste chat service. If u order food & for EX when u get cow dung got delivered by zomato executive. zomato won't care for u & their email & chat service say we are just like a courier service & we dont care what u received. They simply say to give low rating to restaurant & complaint closed. 2 times I slept with out eating after ordering in ZOMATO, the food delivered was uneatble condition. Only money minded service will not stay longer.",1
"Pathetic. The delivery guy did not bother to find our house and conveniently sent a 'your phone is unavailable' message. After we managed to contact the delivery guy, we told him we would come to pick the order wherever he was. But when we reached his location, he cut and blocked our numbers. We stood there, at the mall where he was for HALF AN HOUR and our calls were blocked. To top it all, there is nothing called a helpline on the app. Pathetic experience and NEVER ORDERING AGAIN.",1
"- Delivery is getting delayed by 30-40mins, happened 4 times with me one after other. - chat support revert with a delay..experienced it of 15mins, most of time - food displays as delivered, but it won't. - delivery boy lies about delays.",1
in starting it was good but now it is fooling its customers.food never arrive on time. sometimes they even dont deliver the food for which we have already paid and not refund the amount. be careful while ordering.,1
Worst Experience. Everytime i order something you don't confirm the order immediately. I have to wait for 20 minutes or more till the valet reaches to confirm the order. Sometimes you don't even inform the order is cancelled. Really bad service. Everytime it's disappointing,1
There should be an alarm when your order arives at your doorstep because sometimes we might just forget that we ordered or we might get to sleep or the delivery guy might not be able to contact us....so the app should alarm us...isn't the best idea for an upgrage...what say Akshar?,2
"Its a total waste of time. When lot of users place orders, due to load the app goes off. Does not process your payment and if the order gets placed thwn it is not delievered. You even can't connect to the customer care.",1
"Really bad. Food is late most of the times, and when you call the restaurant they say that the food already dispatched and it takes them ages to deliver it. 30min from motor city to sports city. Really disappointing and the worst customer service ever. Whatever you tell them, feels like you're chatting with a machine. Just sorry, i understand, thank you kind of reply.",1
"Good app to order food. Minor issues need to be fixed while adding new credit card. When I added a details, insted of showing the success message, it showed same page. This created confusion.",4
This is my #1 go-to app for searching any restaurant! I love it! The ratings and feedback and most frequently ordered always help in choosing the perfect restaurant. Delivery services are also very prompt,5
Pathetic. I was just checking options for delivery in one of the outlets and the order got placed. And then I cannot cancel the order as I have to bear charges. The AI who supports on the order is also useless Doesnt solve the queries.,1
Pathetic customer service. Swiggy is far better. They are quick to call back and they refund money unconditionally Updating this on 30/11/19 and the app is still as bad. Phone number for indigo deli Bandra in invalid. Can't reach the restaurant after placing the order.,1
The worst delivery app. no tracking details in the app. The customer has to wait for the food even if there is a delay. refund will not be given if we cancel any order for more delay. worst delivery app.,1
Worst food got today ever since.,5
It's services are Gd but it really should work on some. It's too easy to use. Places orders immediately with just one click and does ask for confirmation. I am a victim of this 2 times out of 3 home deliveries I have ordered through this app Pls fix it,4
This app does not provide quicks links to the required sites it keeps diverting like from google to app and all but does not give the site asked.Also it has a fast payment and place order functioning.Also the website designing was filled with no. Of adds. Which kept popping now and then.,1
"Much better app than rivals. Excellent service and great deliveries. Variety of options is good and offers are almost always there, all in all, value for money.",5
"It has the worst service. I got rotten food that was smelling like hell. Tried chatting them through support and I waited for like 45 minutes but no one responded to my text. At the last I got response as ""sorry for disappointing you, were we helpful?"" I mean seriously are you guys kidding 😂. And when I said that may I know who was responded to my text, they said sorry we cannot share this information as they were not allowed to share names. Seriously what customer service in the world is that",1
"Refund policy with zomato is terrible, I received an order with missing items and when I emailed zomato support I received no response or refund, in order to get refund only the restaurant can contact zomato and process it for the customer, on deliveroo refunds are instant! So I won't be using zomato again for this reason. Many times you have missing items from order and it's just a big hassle on this app.",5
Very slow app and food I ordered through this app is very bad. Yesterday order something from KAKE da Hotel it seems they deliver old food of 2 days . Food quality is pathetic. SWIGGY is much better app and easy to use. On ZOMATO food prices are also higher than SWIGGY. They charge huge prices from customers and restaurants deliver bad quality food. Useless app.,1
"oh! please don't go for Zomato,go for swiggy,that's going to be much better than this. I literally ordered three meal boxes and just one arrived at my door step although the delivery man was kind but the service by Zomato was literally far below the earth's crust. and the main point to get raged on is that I paid the bill online before the food was reached at my doorstep.🖕🖕",1
"I couldn't able to use any of the coupon. Its showing error all the time. Really frustrated with the experience. Simply for advertising, they are doing like this.",1
"Every order via Zomato is a delay and unfortunately they think 50%credit back is always the answer. They are supposed to be ""service providers"" and what use to be their strength has become their weaknesses. Guess we need to move to other Apps",1
Good app. Need a little better track of the hygeine and reviewing. The food may not be as expected by the user as he gets waved away by review. There needs to be a better autiding on the hygeine of the food being prepared and quality of food,4
guys its a trap better get a maid or cook yourself atleast you will be satisfied with home food.The food isnt good and in case you got your food stale nobody will address it neither zomato nor the restaurant..Food ordering online is a premium act but they provide stale food for which u wont be able to complain.Now they will comment please mail here and ther bur the problem will remain same.Also there are scenarios in whih they wont either dwliver the food and they also cut the charge for food .,1
Too fast delivery,5
i am foodie. on daily basis i order food online. i think worst app i ever used. when they deliver wrong food that time they did not do anything. when there is delay of 3 minutes in receiving order they charge amount from us. such a fraud and worst app.and customer service another level worst. they did not even reply on complaint.,1
"Worst app , charges differently from people to people , when ever i orders something on Zomato it costs me 40-60 ₹ more , but when i checked the price of the same food from same resturant from same location on other mobiles it's costs them 10-20 ₹ only but for me it's costs 40 -60 on max orders , even for the resturant which is in 3 km range it's charges me 40 - 50 ₹ which it costs only 20 ₹ if i use any private transportation , why i must pay more then others , Swiggy is more better then u",1
Worst app for food deliver. I placed order many time and they cancelled by themselves. In fact customer service is worst. They never respond to the customer. I always faced refund issue with them. They also don't have any customer care contact to resolve the issue,1
The worst service ever. I made an order and had to cancel as the address was wrong. Tha order was of 477 rupees which was for 1kg of kalakand sweets. Now they have retained the whole amount as cancellation cost. I appreciate the cancellation charges but it should b reasonable and not trying to harass the customers. Amd the support person who ever we chat with talk in a very low profile manner.,1
One of the worst and bakwas app. Customer service also worst there not respecting to customer. After ordering the food order will cancel automatically and same time cash collecting from customer. After cancellation food order refund they will not do. Making money purpose there doing. customer support also not supporting to customer. There cheating to people. Still I have not received my two refund amount. Don't order in Zomato. It's entirely cheating app,1
"This app doesn't take permission for default payment. It set automatically if you last pay from paytm it will auto deduct money from paytm wallet, if you cancel that with in 5 sec they don't give your money return back and give a foolish reason we don't waste food, said me how in 5 sec food is cooked or processed. Now a days zomato app are worst e-commerce app. So many times gps location not pick your location properly and many more problems in this app.",1
"It says ""ease your customer's pain"" the app is designed keeping this in mind. user friendly and prompt servicce. Once I received food which was not ordered by me. I got it redolved in 1 min through live chat.",5
"Extremely unhelpful and the chat wait time is very long. They don't care about their customers whatsoever and never bother to entertain the customer's request. Very disappointing,worst service ever.",1
"Wondering how this got 4.3 rating, first thing one of wrost customer service, and they play with there own rules, if order is placed by mistake they don't have cancellation. They deliver v late or order will be taken late sometime cancel themselves wow. I ordered only 3 times because of promo code but all 3 times v bad experience, uninstalling app now",1
The first few orders delivered on time but one recent order was showin 25 min to deliver even after an hour it was showing 25 min. When i enquired they said the order is cancelled due to delivery issues. They made me wait for an hour and cancelled my order. Do dont trust in zomato anymore.,1
worst App. I have ordered a birthday cake for my sister through you Zomato App. But cake is not delivered and my order was cancelled by your deliver boy. I got a massage saying that my mobile number was not reachable and no one found at my destination address to pickup this order. I have ordered many time at same address but I didn't get any issue like this even delivery man delivers without making any call to locate my address as this is my correct home address and very easy to locate.,1
Pathetic experience. worst app. they do not have option to cancel the order immediatly on the app and while connecting on chat they take long time to reply and never respond and charge 100% cancellation amount even if you cancel in just 2 minutes. pathetic services.,1
i got my order one hour late and also the delivery person marked it delivered before delivering and when i reached out for help at zomato they told me refund and replacement both are not possible. my food got cold and was just a waste for me. I dont understand why was refund or replacement both was not possible. and it was totally delivery persons mistake!,1
Chat option is worthless. Can't move back once you make a wrong tap.,1
I would like it very much if a feature is added : my past ratings for a particular resturant or particular dish should be displayed under My Orders tab. This helps me to remember what my experience was with a particular restaurant even if that was some time back and help make informed choices.,5
Worst experience ! Worst app ever! Delivery boys are horrible. I just ordered a food just because of the delivery boy couldn't find my location he keep on arguing with me and canceled my order. Plus zoomato has not refunded my money also.,1
Worst app... Uber eats was way better than this.. I ordered from a hotel which was only one shown in the app and waited for 40 mins to know that you cannot deliver as it is 14 km away!!! What the hell! So why did you accept the oder or show that hotel??,1
Since I didn't receive any call from Zomato but I got a response from customer care saying the delivery agent called you 8 times but you didn't attend the call. Yes we will attend the call only if we get the call but without receiving any call how you guys could pretend and blame on customers. I need a valid logical explanation for this issue. We can't let the things go like this. If not we can come to conclusion that Zomato is not customer centric with unsatisfactory customer experience.,1
Defective delivery system I ordered a delivery from chai point at DLF mall Noida and fed the address ..Zomato took this address and added my present location as well although I was trying to change the location.At that point my location was some other place and i was trying to get the food delivered at some other place.Either zomato should have seen the address and declined to take the order Or then make sure they deliver the address fed in the system.They deducted 336.13/- and refused to refund,1
Wrong quantity delivered. Tried customer care support to report problem but no response. Called up restaurant directly to send balance quantity of order. Took almost 1.5 hrs for them to deliver it to me. Guests had to wait just because order delivery was not handled properly.,1
Worst experience with zomato. I am uninstalling this app... As on cancellation they are charging full fee and app system is not appropriate. zomato app does not confirm the order properly and on just one click they booked the order. As I cancelled it in less than one minute.I am asking for refund but app's messaging system is also worst.,1
Worst customer service.Please refrain from ordering. Customer support takes > 30min and that's after queuing time. No way to contact or track delivery guy and you basically become helpless when restaurants do not pick up the phone. Moreover the delivery person do not even knock the door or call alternate number when one's phone is not reachable. On top of that be prepared for charges and if it's night time then my friend you may have to sleep empty stomach. P.S. this is after I have sent an email,1
Worst app. They might deliver you bad food and when you complain then they will tell that sorry we can't help. I ordered a cake for the birthday and found that cake was so bad that we have to throw it... And when I called customer support they told Sir we can't help you ... You are late So should I open the cake at the time of delivery and cut the cake before the birthday .. Worst Worst cake shop is Cakesta..,5
"Good, however there is no option to cancel the order, when restaurant cancel the order there will be no proper explaination. Better to add features to order from multiple locations atleast 2 locations at a time",3
The service has degraded severely.. The customer service representatives and the delivery boys have no sense of responsibility or awareness to handle a customer query. I am uninstalling the application post facing a series of bad experiences with Zomato. Had enough!,1
"Do not opt if you need deliveries in time. Once the valet is assigned and your order gets delayed because of other orders which the same valet has to deliver, you are screwed badly. The chat is not that helpful. Opt for swiggy whenever possible.",1
"I ordered an item,then i checked the gps location was wrong so i sent a message and even called the valet about the situation...if he wanted to cancel the order he could have done that then only but after the order was ready i got a call saying that my address was wrong and i wouldn't be getting any refund.... swiggy is much better!!!",1
very bad hopeless service new trick to earn money from customers... they are cancelling order without informing and not refunded the same if u ask them refund details they denied to share it and irritating to u tell u u check ur account we have refund... not listen to us also very bad experience.... hopeless service they should rate negative ....(. we already mailed you but only said standard answer from you that we will refund within 7 days u resolve here only in public platform ),1
"It's a waste of time order something from it. It doesn't show restaurant at all time. When it show it doesn't not give any time to order anything. It say that restaurant are not taking order online, but they are. I really don't like this app at all.",1
"Dear people my experience with zomato so sad. They are walking with stores who are there to loot peoples. You will not get what you order. If there is quality or quantity issue they just settle you with inconvenience fee Rs 80.other than this there is no solution. You are at the mercy of merchant who process your order. You will get what they throw at your face. My dear public, who ever see this keep away ordering grocery using zomato. You all have a good day.",1
Am regular customer since long everything is good but as per the situation you have to be careful that your riders obey the rules last week I order for contactless delivery but later I noticed that your rider didn't wear gloves at the time of delivery. So please be careful because if people are ordering it means they are trusting you.kindly check on riders that they wear gloves at the time of delivery. Thanks and all the best,4
I have tried all major food ordering app but no one compete Zomato App. Large pool of restaurant than any other app. Customer support is excellance. It is easy to connect with customer support and get prompt solutions of the issue. I have always received wonderful support from them. Thanks Zomato.,5
I am changing my rating to 1 star coz there is no 0. I was placing the order with Promo Code and I got a call. I came back and placed the order. I noticed that the no Promo Code was applied as it got flushed away. When reached out to Support they were reluctant to make sure the Promo Code is applied for me or allow me to place the order. This is not an issue from my side rather from the App which doesn't have the Promo Code sticked to the order once applied. I am deciding to uninstall the App.,1
"I am tired of this app, whenever I open it to place any order,none of the restaurants are delivering! And after restarting the app,they become available and on the payment page again the same thing",1
"most of the time your delivery executive are not able to see maps and locate the building, they are always confused and go somewhere on another direction and yell at us, while in swiggy they will come to your door step without any trouble with the location.",1
"Really enjoying this app, it is a real time saver when you're in hurry and need a lot of options without going out. But the offers aren't very good. They remain constant and aren't applicable on the good restaurants. This can be improved.",4
Please improve the order tracking quality. Most of the times this application does not give the correct route for the delivery valets... always there is a guiding from the customer requires to reach the food at his location...,2
"1. User friendly interface. 2. Startup time is reasonable. 3. Bug free flow to connected apps. 4. Exciting offers makes it more Indian. 5. If the orders get failed due to the problem caused from their end, they refund back money immediately after messaging them through app itself.",5
"I use this app like everyday here in Abu Dhabi, it gives you a variety of options to choose from, lot of timely promotions and good customer service in case you are having any trouble with the restaurant who accepted your order. I've been using the app for the last 5years😊, would highly recommend it.",5
horrible customer service.. first my order got cancelled bt still account got debited.. when order from my other card the order got placed. now after 30 min the first order got placed again with out my knowledge. now i could not able to contact the customer service representative the app says they flooded with queries . wat kind of service is this,1
"This site sucks. Why? 1.I once ordered food from a restraunt 5 mins away from my house and they took my order but cancelled it 40 mins after it was placed. I then ordered from Swiggy and it was delivered within 20 mins. The zomato personnel blamed me for not playing through card for this mess up. 2. Before I placed my order the app said 24 mins for delivery. As soon as I placed the order, the delivery time changed to one hour. I cancelled my order but I was charged 350 rs as cancellation fee.",1
Used to be very good with Gold subscription. Now Gold is called Pro. 1+1 discounts or 2+2 drinks are gone. 25% only now. They changed the conditions ob thev fly. No discount on delivwey even if the restaurant don't provide dine in. The subscription became pretty much worthless. For sure I will not renew.,2
"I am using this app since 3 years and till then I would say I never experience any bad services, but today while I was placing an order , my order was somehow not placed but within a second my money got deducted . Bad part bout this app is, there is NO ZOMATO HELPLINE NUMBER AVAILABLE ON GOOGLE and those available are either not valid or not reachable.",2
"The custome care is extremely unprofessional. The only way to contact zomato is through the app's customer care chat. When customers do not get food they ordered and paid for and the delivery agent mishandles the food, the only assurance zomato gives is stern action will be taken with the restaurant. What about the liability zomato owes to its customers. First you say you will give a refund through your customer care executive and then they say it is not possible.Customers r not valued",1
"Can you imagine an app with no customer care helpline number? Well Zomato is the answer and if they deliver you garbage, they say they will rate the merchant single star but there is no way to return the food or talk to customer care helpline if there are any issues with your order.",1
"ordered from zomato for the first time and had the worst experience ever. did online payment for my food, but the order was rejected from the restaurant. i was promised that the money will be refunded in account by 2-7 days. its been more than 3 months now. the money was never refunded. worst food delivery app and service ever. better delete it",1
Only a very few hotels and restaurants in Kottayam are available. When it was Uber eats we had assess to a large number of hotels and dishes.The service was really great. But after Zomato owned Uber eats literally we can't have nothing we wish to eat. Delivery charge is unacceptable when compared to Uber eats. Really pathetic performance.,3
Worst experience ever I had today....the app is totally dumb. When you start a youtube an ad appears...but this is actually a junk app. It don't show the restraunts which is open now which is still accepting order on swiggy.....thats why everyone should go for swiggy.,1
Oftenly order is delayed. There is a new way to cheat people and attract them to pay 10rs extra... Also...Quality of food gets us disappointed...posted severe feedbacks but no response was made by zomato.... Swiggy and other platforms are really doing great in terms of customer service and support,1
"Service is very Bad. Everytime I order, they have some issue. Some times order will be missing or sometimes the order will be toooo late and the zomato valet do not pick the calls. Also, support executive are useless. They don't do anything. Very Bad service.",1
"After Uber eats is taken over by Zomato, the deals are bad and misleading. They say 40% discount and for a bill of 160 give Rs 20. For cash on delivery remove even that paltry 20. Ordering on Zomato will put a hole in your pocket. I was very happy with Uber eats. Very dissatisfied with Zomato. I am going to uninstall the app and stop using Zomato.",1
"Good, but food never comes on time. Which is major default. Till now most of my orders are late.",3
Nice! Better than the others!,4
"Love the app , dislike the new notification sound. Earlier it used the default notification sound as per your settings, but now it uses a sound that just startles you. (This is feedback based on multiple users)",3
Rates are increased before i saw and then discount coupons are available. So what happens is after applying discount coupons or promo codes we land down same price as the restaurant. I liked gold offers. They are quite useful.,3
Really poor support from helpline team. I have faced 3 bad experience from my last orders. They have not delivered an actual food what I have ordered and when I have taken help from support team they couldn't help me. It's just like cheat and fraud beacase the order I have received is cheaper than what I have paid.,1
The problem is the restaurant's blatantly ignore the special instructions and when you call crappy zomato support they just make your life hell in proving you are either wrong stating you've not given any special instructions or blatantly refusing refunds even when its specifically mentioned in special notes that I dont eat veg as im alergic to it lol.. So it seems they dont really care if you die.. There is your rating thanks fot asking me to rate anyway.. Needed this to be seen and dealt with..,1
"worst customer service.careful with your online payments.i would like share my experience here.i repeated the food order (7th feb 2019) on 8th feb money got deducted but my order was cancelled without notification. when i opened that chat service no one replied. unable to find customer service and the provided numbers are not working .the next day 09th feb i informed issue via chat service but they said reorder again and pay the amount, i said the money got deducted they said we cant help .",1
"I hate this blood sucking app. It always lures you with amazing offers and coupons and deals, but it ends up charging so much extra, all the damn time. The taxes they charge are as high as the food itself. I'd rather starve myself than ever order food from this app.",1
"They are purposely changing saved addresses just so that people are forced to cancel orders and they can pocket the money. No one answers when you call the helpline number, their tracking site doesn't work and the chat is abysmal.",1
Worst service from Zomato. One of my orders was missing an item which I reported as soon as i received the order. I also mailed their customer service explaining the whole thing along with the order id. Its been 4 days and they didn't even bother to reply. Worst service. I was a loyal customer of Zomato but not any more . Uninstalling right away,1
"most of the time order rejected. so much disappointed... whenever i ordered , order had accepted after one hour order has automatically cancelled without any information. i called to delivery boy, he told that your order cancelled. when i called to the customer care also no response from them",3
"Dilevered not proper, all vegitables are in one side",1
"Excellent app , we are able to use flexibly for what ever need like ordering food, giving feedback thro customer care about the food and service. Zomato reaches every hook and corner to get best of variety and discounts better than even directly dining.",5
promo code is not show in new user account and cash on delivery,2
"Zomato has the worst service ever. Few days back I ordered something for which I paid 50rs just for delivery and the food was delivered after 90 min. Yest I ordered and they cancelled it after 20 min saying its not available. Moreover they are levying a big amt of tax these days. Also the refund process is very long and support executives are not at all responsible, they just copy paste the template and leave the chat unsolved. You don't even deserve 1 star, improve your customer service.",1
Very bad experience with Zomato... Not expected such a worst thing from such a leading company... I have order the food and pay the money which we decided to later on change the plan and go out... At the time of cancellation of order i have been asked for bearing the penalty without mentioning any amount.. Which i agreed considering it will be restricted to normal delivery charges but to my surprise they forfeited the whole amount and not even intimated and now not even answering the chat.,1
"Everytime I order food from Zomato, it is delivered quick! Superb service — response from the Zomato online chat, updates, super quick! Really, today's food, delivery time were totally satisfactory. The valet was catchy and smart enough! Keep up the good work and maintain the quality.",5
The food delivery was on time and I'm having great experience with Zomato. I definitely recommend this app to all the foodies around. It's the best app among it's contenders for online food and the service is awesome.,5
Very late delivery timings. Delivery agent refuses to deliver any time and they change agent many times within a order that anyhow make your order delayed.,1
Very very poor quality food I received from kake da dhaba Chennai. I had ordered five items out of which one was kabuli phudina paneer Tikka in which there was no salt pepper no merination to paneer no kabuli chana and Ned to search phudina. Very atrocious quality just 5small pics of paneer no tomatoes or capsicum with paneer Tikka no salad no chatni at RS.230. all waste of money. Quantity of sabzi was not even small bowl one can't have even one roti with that. think 10times before ordering,1
"most awful, and unprofessional service app they dont even provide a customer care number or apt response on there chat section, my order was automatically cancelled by the delivery agent and my money has heen taken by Zomato. i have still not got any response. if you are running a service make sure your customers are serviced properly. this is just day time looting awful.",1
"I'm a Gold member since last 1 year & have been using Zomato in Dubai and India. While i used it in Dubai, the service it provided was extra ordinary without any issues. However, ever since I have shifted to India, the quality of food and packaging is concerning me. There is no way to launch a complain for any order and I can no longer talk to the customer care executive for refunds / taking back the order.",1
"I ordered the food before 11 pm from zomato. I was getting every update as my order has been accepted by the restaurant, the food is being prepared, the order is on the way. I have not received my order till 12:43 AM. The order was placed from restaurant ""Firangi Bakes"". When I tried to chat with zomato support team then they replied that we are not responsible for this delivery as the delivery boy was from restaurant and not from zomato and also refrained from refunding my money back.",1
Worst experience i ever had because i did online payment by google pay and payment get deducted but in zomata it did shown payment is not being processed i did talk to customers care And according to them i will receive refund after 5 workings day but i still get nothing. Very disappointed toward service of this app. And will not recommend anyone to install this application.,1
"No support may be provided and money is as good as gone. zomato doesn't take responsibility for restaurants listed with them. It's all random luck what kind of experience you will get. Gets better, now even payment is a nightmare",1
"Just love the way zomato offers me coupons on every Saturday Sunday and sometimes on week days. The customer care support is not that active, I had such a bad experience. Otherwise app is best and way more easy to use.",4
Overall ok but problem is all food items are mostly COSTLIER online than actual prize in restaurants each n every item is 15=20 rs costlier i dont know if others have noticed it. The delivery charges are also taken once i paid packing charge of rs 56 Also taxes . So zomato is becoming costlier n costlier from initial days.,3
very poor service from customer support. I had ordered the food I got it in time but the food is to salty which I cant eat so I an chatting with customer support and now they are providing less then 25% refund. And customer service person is trying to convince me to accept this as it is. Thus is really very pooor support from Zometo and because of it I will stop using this app. Swiggy is much better then Zometo for customer support.,1
"Rates of menus on app are higher than those in respective restaurants. Delivery valets never check google maps and always call up to ask for directions, and get fooled around the address more often than not, resulting in delay.",3
"I got damaged cake and when asked for return they offered only half amount, is this my problem that I got damaged cake. They are cheaters, they don't refund in cash and replace it with promo code and this is actually ur cash and when used next time the promo code is also revoked. Very bad method of making money. They are cheaters and trying to cover their loss by customers actual money",1
Pathetic customer service I have been in contact from last 19 days my money hasn't been refunded to my account yet. Talked to chat support and that person was way too rude to even address the issue correctly. Then on email story continues no help and then I am still waiting. Worst experience and about user interface there is no option to reach hierarchy to forward the complaint to next higher person who can look into it.,1
"Not Bad if feeling hungary and need to fill stomach. But for sure need to improve few vendors who cook food instantly considering the online order which doesn't comes free. Online customer also pay, they also work for a month and gets salary into the bank. Try to patch up with good vendors.",5
Worst delivery app. they take your orders and after waiting for a long time the restaurant calls up and says that they will not be able to deliver the order. this has happened to me at least 4-5 times now.,1
"The order gets placed in a location much away from the delivery location, keeping a branch nearby though. And there is no proper facility to communicate for cancellation, as the charge a cancellation fee of more then the sum bill amount. Highly disappointed.",1
Amazing app i always use for all my food orders.,5
prepaid orders are mostly always late. better to go for cash on delivery or walk/ drive upto the restaurant for eating because they will starve you to death with no regrets making you hope that the order will reach in 5mins (they always miss a 0 in 50),1
Just loving it . All the specification and details of the restaurants are clarified perfectly . Food delivery and service is very keen . And most importantly the discounts they provide are incomparable.,5
"I ordered pizza and it was served super cold. Delivery person carrying just pizza box w/o insulation box. Order was also incomplete. They refund me some random amount and when I asked reason for not having full refund, customer care responded that refund was given by bot and he cannot do anything. I wish zomato gud luck with such kind of service.",1
Horrible experience from one week. One cash refund because the hotel is not even accepting the order. One late delivery. Now today the restaurant guy calls to tell me food is ready and no valet to pick up. Had to wait 45 mins for new valet to be allotted and still waiting for delivery. My 6 year old daughter is crying with hunger for last 30 mins,1
It's good though.... But it takes a lot of time to deliver the food.... I think that they can atlest look at the timings and improve a bit... Cuz it takes more that an hour to deliver...... Please look at the matter.... otherwise its service is very nice,1
Looting the people!! Would love to give it a big ZERO. Pathetic customer service and Charging the amount of the cancelled order are few of your ugly techniques to cheat people. WHY should I have to pay for the order which was cancelled less than 1 minute...??? instead of ordering food from your app...i will never use it..Hope you should respect the customers.,1
Looting customer by imposing so much extra charges. Also rate at restaurants and at app have difference.,1
"Very Useless app Whenever its rainy season and you want something to order , It shows CLOSED FOR ORDERING You have guests and want something, It shows Closed for ORDERING or CURRENTLY NOT ACCEPTING ORDERS And when we goes to same restaurant, we get thing available and 3-4 boys with ZOMATO Tshirt sitting ideal outside restaurants I am from Ankleshvar Gujarat And Its everyday story in Ankleshvar",1
There should be quantity per plate against each item which will allow the client to decide number of plates to be ordered,1
"Uber eats was much better than this zomato, there are no working coupons, delivery takes too long even if you order from a shop behind your home. It is just a pathetic and overpriced app. Even after 50% off you will get your order at 60% more than its cost price.",2
My experience was worst I have ordered pizzas and the garlic bread. We are waiting for our order but we get to know that our order has been cancelled. I will never order anything from the Zomato. It is the worst app in the world.😠😠😠,1
"Items and hotel availability are good, however charging delivery fee of Rs. 50,Rs.40 for the restaurants less than 2 km is not acceptable",1
its a good app.... but when u order something it took half an hour to be accepted and more 15 min to be cancelled automatically. when i paid the money for the order it took 2 minutes but for refund 2-7 days.... look forward to it....,4
It is a great experience to have all kinds of foods at my doorstep! Mostly prompt delivery and good quality of items delivered. Customer care staff is also responsive and well behaved.,5
I have been using Zomato for a while now and usually it provides a decent service but once they cancelled the order without any prior information and they said they called but I didn't receive any calls nor were there any phone records stating the same...no refund as well as no food... my building guard said no one even came with food...and the customer care also didn't help stating it my fault.,4
hey have one one the worst experience with this app. Have ordered food 3 times from them and they have served such a bad food like they have been tued up with worst restaurant to make customer up happy and take a money from them. Even on 14th March I have ordered a food and haven't got the food and they don't even bother to return the money back. Dey just smply say that I was needed to be informed earlier have done this but there was no response from there. Got 150 rupee stucked with them.,1
"Very bad & unprofessional experience. I have rasied concern many times regarding food quality related issues , packaging issues, spoiled foods, & many more. They despite of taking action they simply write we will take care next time & close the chat... I guess you should learn something from the chat response team of uber eats which you acquired recently. They are far better than you. If there would have been option to provide you negative stars, I do have given you 5 negative stars.",1
nice experiance....fast delivery,4
As a refund for poor food they'll give promo code and if we use the complete money in promo code the rest of money would be vanished. In that case swiggy refunds to the account back in the form of money itself and won't cheats the customers when talking about it. I'm so disappointed on zomato. That's why I rate one. My money is gone.,1
Too much of delay in delivery. Food delivered with soil in it. Management not taking care . customer support executive is not responding quickly and un satisfactory response. Using this app is like throughing money in sand. If u use u will get soil in ur food,1
The customer service needs to improve a lot. Giving customers false promises on the status of the order is a total no no. It is not a favor but the service provided is being charged. Customer service needs to improve drastically.,1
awesome exprience with food delhivery app. Very compitable and possitive support. it concerns about our time & trend. it offers many discount. it can be said that it is more easy and & cheap to get food and your own home.,5
"If there is no option available for me other than Zomato, then I will resist my hunger instead of ordering unhygenic and too much spicy food from Zomato. It not only happened once but they treated twice in the similar fashion. The food was delivered in a polythene which was dirty and the food was extremely spicy and was stinking too. So I uninstalled this App. It disappointed me. Today due to Zomato my stomach is paining and had a vomiting too. I would rate 0.0000000000000000000000000001",1
"verg nice app but you have to improve on customer support as i have found some support representative denying to help or wrong or incorrect order, they are convincing us to have the food which we received incorrect order. this is so annoying...",3
They are doing froade with people by there offers. They are providing cash back coupon for cricket World Cup and they mention in there rules that we can use this coupon till 8:30 pm. but every time I open at 6:00 pm coupon is not there. I lost my 2 coupon like that. I also try to contact using there chat support they told me to contact through email so. I email with my problem but they did not back to me. so I feel like I cheated by Zomato.,1
I'm here not to review the app but for a humble request. I request all the foodies out there not to opt for plastic cutleries if its an option. Avoid single use plastic bags for the parcel. Tell the delivery boy not to bring the carry bag if its plastic. Lets make a difference. Lets make a change in our Environment by doing our bit.,5
"What a worst service. Fud items were missing. If you cannot provide proper food, please dont take the order. UBER EATS and SWIGGY are way better than this app. No customer care service for this app. How could a service app behave like this. Its a lose of money and time.",1
"You'll die Hungary if you order from this aap. Ordered pizza, after so long time I was at least able to place order, and after sometime they say technical issue order can not be place, your money will be refunded in 7 days. Idiots taking money from customers n getting interest from Banks. Without any service. Will not suggest. It's very confusing to place order also. We're trying to place order they're sitting options for restaurant review and other stuff. Peace of junk.",1
have been using there services for more than an year...Poor services. with some generic responses in service chat... Delivery not on time most of the times... Extra charges and taxes than other apps.. No grievance redressal... If ypu are hungry do not rely on Zomato,1
Giving 1 star and you guys no the reason.,1
pathetic customer service. I have placed an order and its status is delivered but i didnt receive any order. After informing customer service they have told me that the delivery is damaged. i have asked how come it shows delievered then. They have asked me for rearranging the meal I have said yes but after that neither i got any reply from the customer service not i got a refund or meal. Even after tweeting the issue to zomato twitter handle still no one seem to care. Pathetic customer service.,1
My today's experience was good if not excellent. Little delay in getting the delivery. Packing was Good and the food was very good. Shall give 5 stars with little improvements. But overall I am happy.,4
order cancelled without informing the customer and the funds not refunded back.very poor service. you don't even have an option of calling the customer care. no one responds. the delivery agents are useless. I am never ordering from this app.,1
I have order some dishes in Nov 2nd week. The order was cancelled by resturant side. They said amount will be refunded with 7 workind days. But still now i didn't get the amount.Also zomato customer support as said you will be refunded you amount next 24 hours day to day repeatedly. Very very worst services it shows.,1
never use this app as they are not atall customer friendly. they are just here to make money. accidently my order got placed and immediately within 10sec i called restaurant. restaurant was helpful and was ready to cancel but zomato refused to canceled after making me chat for 40mins. after 40min they said ur order will be cancelled but u will not receive any refund.,1
"The refund policy is pathetic. I ordered from Box8, they themselves canceled the order. I did not get the refund, also it is showing as order delivered in the app. Not sure whether I will receive the refund or not.",1
"Worst app for food delivery,once I order food unfortunately I it was get cancelled by my cousin and they took money as their penalty.so stop using this friends even swiggy is better than this . Then I contact customer service then said it will be resolved in 24 hours.then after they said it can't be resolved. I lot 456 rs friends.so stop using zonato",1
"They are providing offers on dishes by hiking its price. There are menu cards uploaded by the restaurants and zomato simply hiking the price for the dish and then applying service / delivery charges , taxes and then its providing offers which results in purchasing the food in higher than the double price of the dish..",1
"Good app to find the restaurant but worst app for food delivery.Order delivery avg time is 1 hr which is almost double then other food delivery apps.Customer agent talks to you rudely and respond very late.Let me tell you the worst part, If you see menu of a restaurant and will figure it out that price mentioned in zomato is almost double then the price in actual menu card of restaurant.They make you fool as you won't go and cross verify actual menu cards.I verified that for Healthybee restaurant",1
"Order was placed in just 1 hour 20 min for the 3 KM distance. (Navalur to Kazhipattur) in that time we can buy vegetables from shop and we can finish our cooking.. Great experience ever.. I think only one man is working for the entire Chennai. I contacted zomanto helpline after 30 min of order to cancel the order, they replied that cancellation is not there.",1
"Ordered, using the code ""Zomatonew"" which was givinv me a reasonably good offer. I had applied the code, but since I was new to the app, I was asked to link to the payment app, which I did but on going back it cleared the code n took my full amnt. I immediately chatted with an executive but was told, since I paid, nothing can b done. I am unhappy coz I had entered the code, it refreshed on it's own when I was asked to move to the linking page n I get the reply that nothing can be done.",1
"If I save multiple addresses, the order is delivering to the address which I didn't select. And chat support mentions it's my mistake, and call centre executive says it's not their work to check. And there is no refund. It's cheating the people",1
"Excellent customer service, easy interface and quick response. absolutely love it. better than Uber eats. as ive faced a lot of trouble with uber ears lately and have an outstanding of 300 rupees for food which never arrived. thank you Zomato.",5
"The new update is awful - the interface has taken a turn for the worse, and the customer chats are inaccessible and difficult to reach. Fix these issues if you want to keep customers.",1
They've eliminated customer support by tweaking the chat feature so that there is no option for the user to type in their query. The user is instead forced to choose from preset choices and the responses are preset as well. No way to reach customer support now. Brilliant customer support model from Zomato.,1
dont ever order Domino's on this app.. just use less.. and chat support is very bad.. they were lying about the delivery and timing.. and in the end told me that they dont delivery Domino's.. please call them.. and gave me the 1800 number. they dont even know were i ordered from.. 1 star for a billion dollar company.. shame,1
"Zomato needs to do background check of the vendors who supply food, also the delivery charges are high, MOST IMPORTANT - the price on the menu showed in zomato are higher than the actual price of the menu at the hotel, why to order from you if i get 20-25% cheaper rates with free home delivery from the hotel directly?",1
"I get food on the go, or whenever I want and wherever I want. I think I said it all. Please check out the offers they give as they are extremely rewarding. Only thing I do not like about this app is that I have to pay delivery charges. Rest is fine.",5
Hate this application...!! Accidentally I met payment gateway failure...and they promised to refund me back but they didn't...the worst service and application I have ever came across..fraud agents and app too...bloody thieves!! Each time I complained ans they were ready with an excuse...dump people!!!,1
"I placed an order from Burger King. after calling after 45 minutes to the valet, he told that ur order is cancelled . And the Zomato call center or app is showing day ur food is being prepared. chat person didn't respond even after more then one hour of order.. a very very bad response for a costumer who is waiting hungry for ur food",1
"Whenever I add special cooking instructions for the order and try reaching restaurant to convey the same, but no one responds on it. Even if I come on chat and ask support executives they convey like we are sorry for this time and will take care from next time onwards. Worst customer service.",1
"At first when i placed my order on 8th August 2019, it was showing payment was incomplete, but the money was debited from my bank account. And second time i again placed the order, payment was completed and Money was again debited from my bank account. Such a bad experience .",1
I have ordered food approx five times . but everytime it comes destroyed and the delivery boys always says . i have brought correctly . i can not do anything . no refund given and all pizzas were destroyed and delivery boy wants full rating.never use these app again in your life,1
"This app makes u fool . Today I ordered the payment was pending so it was showing to pay in cash , so cancel the order after 2 hours the payment was successful. When I contact them they are telling they will not refund or else they will not give me my order. That's excellent U make fool once and the last time. I don't tells to don't download the app.",1
Refund issue... very very bad. they don't refund money if the order is cancelled even as soon as possible after placing the order. they say that the order processing has begun. but how? i cancelled order as soon as possible. and it is not possible to start processing order within that time. disgusting 😑😑,1
"i have ordered the food through zomato app from Good Bowl restaurant, it is showing status that food is being prepared, showing same status for more than 2hrs. when i called to the restaurant and asked about the food which i have ordered they are saying no zomato guy came to deliver the food. and they said they will deliver order by restaurant guy after calling so many times. After following with restaurant they delivered finally ,2 hours delay.",1
"worst food delivery app. restaurants show those items which are not in stock, then after ordering the restaurant calls us to have a replacement and when we deny they ask us to cancel the order. being unaware that cancelling from our end will lead to a penalty. after repeatedly contacting the customer care there's no help. its very clear that this app is not at all customer friendly, only restaurant friendly and really cheap n fraud app.",1
"very good app for ordering food. 1 star missing because the dish based search doesn't work great, it lists the restaurant and we have to sift through each restaurant menu to order it which can be cumbersome.",4
"I was a regular customer of Zomato since 2 years. But for the last 6 months I'm afraid to order through Zomato App for fear of loosing money. At least 4 times I had problems with either missing items or different item has been received. Though I promptly informed the issue, I was denied replacement, or refund on flimsy grounds. The worst thing with Zomato App is that, You have no telephone access to Customer Care. Zomato will decide, what customer can do. While placing orders, please take photos",2
good services and wide range of options makes users more comfortable and delivery and delivery executives are good. if we have compare option for dishes with same name in available restaurants then it will be more easy to order based on restaurants and their ratings and taste and quality offered.,4
"My previous experience with zomato was good.But now they are cheating customer, accepting food order 1st, then they notify food has been collected, after that the rider will call it can't be delivered in the location,he has been shown different location, and the sad part we the customer has to bear the loss, can't accept its fault though I mail them with the order placed screenshot, consisting of my address.But they keep on sending generic replies but can't help. This was not accepted from ZOMATO",1
Uber eats use to show restaurants applicable to my location which deliver but Zomato shows all restaurants. I ended wasting time thinking otherwise restaurants also delivering but got red alert that they don't. It took a while to add filter to display restaurants which will deliver to my location.,3
"Ordered a food of more than ₹800 and delivery boy cancelled the order saying that it's far away from their allotted delivery distance and gave the official reason that the address was inappropriate,,I contacted the customer support but they also gave me the same reason , if my address was far away from the alloted distance then how come the Zomato accepted my order and now customer care is not replying to my issue .",1
They have a glitch in their app.I have placed order from chai point and ordered ginger chai. The app showed payment failed.So I placed the order again this time also payment failed.When I checked my order section they have confirmed both the orders and both the time money was deducted.When I raised the concern within 2 min they said they can't refund the money as the food is being prepared. They delivered one of the order & gulped my money of the other order. Fraud Zomato,1
Hi zomato. I used to love uber eats and you baught it and worse happen to me. I used to get half grilled chicken for 108 Rupees. Now you have baught uber eats and you are charging 202 Rupees for the same item from the same restaurant . These is really unfair and unacceptable to take out people's happiness. Thanks for destroying everyone's happiness. Your unhappy customer . Nouf,1
Very good services from Zomato and team,5
everything is good ... except the poor customer care service I've experienced. Customer care person are so irresponsible..and you people don't care if a person is a privilege member of your services or not. very bad experience related to services. otherwise the app and functions are good.,3
"some of my favorite resturants are still not available to me because of distance.. and in a small town like Ranchi with Mike traffic in most of the areas, this should not be an issue.",4
Uninstalled the app.. I have paid for a gold membership just 2 months and yesterday I get to see that my account is been blocked without any specific reason. And mailing them is not helping too.. Do not buy the gold membership they might block your account too.. And it won't be able for you to do anything.,1
Stupid and an idiotic systems they have in terms of support.. No excuetive will help you and once you place a order and if the order has poor quality of food delivered to you.. You can't even ask for your refund.. Money once gone is gone for forever.,1
"This is the worst app i can say. Actually i ordered a dosa from zomato but they cancelled my order but on the app it is shown that my order is delivered. When i made a complain against the same, they made me wait for 10 days and everytime they say that your refund has been processed but still i am waiting for the refund. Zomato is really a fake company i must say.",1
i have booked three orders and those were disaster. i recently cancelled a order before the food being picked up due to sudden emergency. those people taken my complete money. i didnt see them mentioning anywer abt cancellation and full amount deduction. i dint get proper response from support. worst app ever,1
"The customer care service of the app is pathetic. When we contact them with a problem in the food order, the only thing they do is apologise and say that they have sent the feedback. That's it.... The money you have lost is lost. Pathetic!!!! At this rate you will not last long.",3
"Dishes of most restaurants are excessively priced to make up for discounts. Please compare the rates of dishes in other apps. Also, the taxes and other charges is a huge rip off. Rs. 79 Tax for a rs. 140 dish. Rs. 4.32 is tax for same item on swiggy. Uninstalling.",1
Pathetic service... Not one restaurant has been accepting orders on zomato Ranchi for the past so many days and nobody knows why... Don't put big ads if you can't fulfill basic expectations of keeping your app running with restaurants accepting orders! No proper customer care also... Very very disappointed!!!!!,1
very worst customer service.....i placed an order with successful transaction but order got cancelled due to their shittiest app.....i ordered again with again successful transaction......and it's been 6hrs with the order status that we are assigning you a valet.....they don't even have a customer support for customers query......you guys don't even deserve 1 star,1
Zomato always made taking dining decisions easy. Rating helps. Approx cost for two is reliable. Zomato Gold is a big time money saver for big foodies. People put realistic pictures of actual ambiance. Map available. Calling restaurant facility is available. Sometimes discounts on delivery. Best food app it is.,5
I am gave one star because there is no zero. Hahaha. After many months i ordered again on Zomato. The service is still the worst. It has been an hour since i ordered. And you people are making the delivery agent wait near the restaurant to collect another order. If you cannot accommodate enough delivery agents why to run an app like this. Will never do a mistake of ordering from Zomato once again. Your chat support sucks!!!! You can't even afford phone support. Pathetic service,1
I have purchased gold membership. In their advert they don't tell you have to purchase minimum 300 rupees value and you have to pay tax which differ on day/night. Sometimes gold delivery is not available. I they had not said to use gold you have to order minimum 300. I never order 300 or more then how I am able to use this. 1800 rupees full waste. No direct contact with customer care.,1
"I just hate this app. It always takes wrong locations. They just give Some Coupons And do not accept coupons On COD. I ordered many times. Delivery pacakaging is very bad and order too slow. Dominos is much much better , even Swiggy And Uber Eats is better than this rubbish app.",1
"Bad company ...no proper bill is provided ...gstn number is missing in all bill, Fake company they do tax stealing ....and also promote vendor to do it , we are thing we get food from brand shop but they provide from local shop that is the reason not sharing food bill",1
Happy by and large. Here is a problem: My orders have been rejected in their entirety because one item was missing from the restaurant. My money was refunded 4-5 days later. I didn't get my food and money got locked. Alternatives could have been suggested.,4
Quite not satisfied with this app . Was using it for the first time. During payment the web page became unavailable. The money was deducted and the offer was not place. Unable to contact about this issue.,2
"I am not a big foodie.. but when it comes to food emergencies, you know what app to look for. It's clean, the design is good, the content is updated, it makes you feel welcome and gives you all the options to choose from.",5
Zomato work very good,5
"Less than 1 if possible. This app is just fraud. I have been using it since so many days now. On my last 5 orders I made I only received 3 orders, 2were not delivered which I have already paid for. When I went to their support team they didn't helped me at all they just kept sending me thale same common system generated message. I would love to mention their name Harsh,Abbas,sukanto they just avoided the issue. Money matters when it's hard earned not for Zomato as they are looting thr customers.",1
Very poor service! They don't refund your money even if they cancel order and give false reasons for cancelling your order. I tried raising the issue by sending email but they don't reply to your mail.,1
"Worst app Doesnt bother about customer and restaurants trouble customer by accepting the order and not delivering it. Zomato too doesnt refund money and they will continue making false promises even after raising concerns to them. Zero Customer satisfaction and indifferent behaviour towards the customers and customer's issues and troubles. They only irritate customers and trouble them by not delivering food on time and if delivered, then deliver wrong food items always. Repeated Worst Behaviour.",1
"Instead of improvement, this app degrades over time. It has been a while since the location accuracy and filter malfunctioned, at least here in Indonesia. Don't bother finding some new places with this app, it'll just be a waste of time. The extra star is just because they offer gold privilege.",2
"Worst customer service. I ordered food at 11pm. Waited for 1 hour. And got the response after on hour that order has been cancelled. It's happening for the 2nd time. Last time also, executive had the similar kind of justifications. Over that, customer care executive called and abruptly disconnected. I am not going to use this service again. I would highly recommend Swiggy over Zomato.",1
"I ordered today from fresh menu restaurant through this app. Estimated delivery time was 11.30 pm but didn't get the order yet, the time is 12:20 am. There's no response from customer care service both chat and customer care number. I'm planning for contat consumer forum.",1
I order from Zomato frequently.....for some reason the entire menu or all the items mostly the best ones aren't visible on the app and then I have to call the restaurant directly or order from some place else... It's very annoying coz when u do call the restaurant the item is available.... please fix this,2
Worst service. It used to be good but their service is going down nowadays. Had ro wait for 2 hours for delivery that was promised for 45 minutes. They keep telling me to wait for ever. The customer service is terrible and they don't have any clue.,1
"today i placed an order to grt panner kadai and i got chicken curry!!! when i tried to reach your chat, i got a message that chat inflow is too much and request to wait.. i waited for sometime but i saw that the time increase and now when i look for chat, i dont see chat box. this is thr 3rd time i am facing issue with my order!",1
Superb Experience Everytime...Every Meal. Delivery Guys please Try To ride slow life is more precious than that food you carry. And Customers...Guys come on Try to tip the delivery guys generously. They really work very hard. They dont ask for it and thts why its more satisfying. Its like a gift for their whole family. God will love you for that...!!!,5
Always the worst experience...whenever I order from Zomato...its always a pain...either the delivery gets late..or some itms are missing. Also when i changed the payment method the promo code disappears and we need to pay the full payment.,1
"I've had no issue with this so far with regards to ordering in and getting my delivery on time. My only feedback is that the app just fails to fetch my live location from time to time. Otherwise, it's perfect.",4
Do check prices with the restaurant before you order through this app Because this company is a cheater And specially don't be a gold member Don't even want to give a single star,1
"Poor service. Customer has been robbed after paying with Paytm. The order is yet to be confirmed by the restaurant even after an hour. Plus the zomato support is not responding. I want my money back. And this is second consecutive time when this has happened to me from the same restaurant. Last time i was levied for not being able to connect, while in reality i was constantly in contact with zomato delivery boy. He had some issues, wanted me to cancel my order and order again. In the meantime the order got cancelled. And they imposed the cancellation charge on me. Very poor. Improve the customer zomato support first.",1
"It was my 1st order on this app, actually I intalled it today itself and thought to try once, wonder! olaaa! I ordered burger, called to Sandeep (concerned person for delivering it), That wishmaster talked very politely and sincerly, totally imprrssed me, got my order on time and we gyz enjoyed it, Thank you Sandeep, Thank you Zommato! keep going on, may God save your hopes!",5
The app has become better in recent days. The user interface is friendly and the available offers are awesome. Even the support has become more efficient & effective. Keep going.,5
"They need to add more restaurants and street food stores. Also, they lack efficient customer support, you have to wait like 5 to 10 minutes to start chatting with the support team.",4
"This app has shown a gradual degradation in holding the customer base. Unnecessarily hiked delivery charges, items not present in restaurant menu's, double price of dishes if you are an Zomato Gold user, etc. With time it is becoming a waste of time to visit this app.!",1
"Have ordered food Several times. Poor Experience with Service Generally. The recent order i have placed was a ice cream and dessert, Both of them melted and couldn't eat it. Feel so bad for Zomato. Waste of money. Profit Motive, Not Service Motive. Try to groom your Service Care and Delivery Valets for future. Uninstalling the app ASAP and sharing my Experience towards.",1
"A very reliable and trustworthy app relevant to food delivery, restaurant table booking, gold experience, restaurant rating and other miscellaneous assists. I am a gold member of this app and i am very happy to use it to the fullest experience. Special thanks to ZOMATO for providing all the services with full responsibility :) .",5
With new update the support doesn't even care about undelivered food. It just hits you with the restaurant number and bails. Restaurant no. Doesn't work sometimes. The chat support option is only for show. There's no one to chat and support.,1
"Very bad. Zomato cancels my order on 2nd Oct'19, by telling me that restaurant will not be delivering any food item that day and tells me that my money would be returned shortly. Instead, the order is marked as delivered in 7 hrs. I assume that it's a mistake. I write to Zomato and get a automatic reply that I will be responded in 48hrs. Still no response. No individual available on chat as well. No customer care number to call on. Pathetic customer service.",1
"Pathetic service. The delivery guy called me, he said I am standing in front of your building and hung up. Then I received a notification that order has been delivered and when I complained about it that time they said you have not picked their call. I sent them screenshot, they did not help me. Then zomato customer care told me, delivery guy gave parcel to security guy. Then I went to security cabin I just saw my parcel lying there for hour.They did not inform security nor me. Pathetic service.",1
No responsibility for cancellation of order... No alternative in case of cancellation like other platform No updated restaurant information ------ Ordered food on zomato suddenly after 20-30 minutes zomato calls you and cancels your order stating restaurant is closed...Dont they should offlisted such restaurant before the order instead of cancelling order afterwards... pathetic way of reacting to customer concern..they think refunding money is all they have to do for making customer happy...,1
Bad experience. This is taking very much of dilevery charges,1
"I have tried it 2 -3 times and i enjoyed it a lot . Even once i had some issues related to order but the cleared my all queries,which i liked the most.......... ........just loved it. I'd rated it four stars as everything is not perfect.",4
"the app hangs a lot. it is either bugged or the company is resorting to malpractice to collect money. The wallet, which is called Zomato credits gets de-selected by itself during payment and the card gets charged a higher amount. be very careful. seems like Zomato is changing",1
"It is really very bad experience with Zomato, I have placed an order that had not been accepted when contacted support team they are not supporting. They will say go and directly contact to the restaurant even they don't give reference no. I don't know what basis we can ask the restaurant that we have placed an order what is the status. Really very bad and all other food ordering apps are also bad.",1
The best app for any foodie.. and hats off to the local delivery guys! So punctual so cordial.. well managed application as well as service.. Thanks Zomato for making life easier for people like us who stay away from home and would have otherwise skipped many meals! 🤣,5
"verry useful application!! im the kind of person who hates giving location address on phone, it takes up to 2 to 3 minutes to write down you location, then it takes 3 minutes to write down your order, then it takes 1 to 2 minutes to repeat back your order, soo you end up with 5 minutes for just a sandwich and few platters. so with this application it takes you 2 minutes to place your whole order and plus you can track it!!!",5
Very much thankfull in lockdown,5
i was just selecting the food and somehow the order got placed and paid on its own..when i complained your chat guy said it cannot be canceled or i hv to pay chrages! this is so stupid.. i spent money on food that i dont even wanted! this was my last order on zomato!,1
"very baad experience, they do claim that they will assist you in any queries and in any issues, but they don't, even delivering order in same address, in which you have already ordered previously is a issue for them, and they themselves cancel your order, and they'll not refund your money.",1
"Well i love zomato ,the hunger savoir in the nights with affordable and a reasonable price . I would have given the five star rating but the complaints are sometimes ignored so i m giving 4. Out of all the food apps zomato is the best food delivery app.",4
one the worst service they are giving to customer. if will order sonthing and by mistake its cancelled they will not return ur money and no body will give you proper response. nobody is there whom you can call and discuss for ur money. worst app. worst service. worst custome support. they are totally making people fool.,1
"Few problems here and there but good offers till now. But I do see a hike in price of many items recently. If i get an item from a restaurant, they take 100rs but the same restaurant on zomato take 160 for the same item",4
Users Be Aware: This app does not ask your permission before reading the OTP SMS which gets sent to your mobile when you provide your mobile number for login. I therefore assume this app is also able to read all SMS that are delivered to your mobile number including confidential ones.,1
"The zomato customer care people are not at all helpful. I accidentally orderd a diffrent dish and wanted to change the order. So i askd the customer care how to do it. To which they replied that it cant be done. They said that they'll check with the restraunt, if they can modify it. And replied to me that the restraunt said it cant be done. Then i called the place and here are the exact words used by the restraunt owner ""mene kuchh mana nahi kiya. Jhut bol rahe zomato wale."" so 0 stars for them.",1
"Bad service with respect to chat support, agents are rude by behaviors. They send smiley, they try closing the chat without resolving the query, before the chat is closed they forcefully send good night text to get rid of customer without resolving the concern, Zero value towards customer, No emphathy, Why do they even sit helping the customer when they do not do it from there heart, why should customer suffer for what company could not keep up with there promise of delivering right product?",1
I had worst experience. They are not reached me and cancelled my order and said no refund and no food. I was waiting in my home for more than 30 minutes. Please never ever use this application. They are just business minded people,1
Service very good,5
"The delivery guy reached a different location and I was told by your unnecessarily rude customer service lady that it's my fault. Do I really have to check if 'YOUR' GPS is working fine? Because that's what I was told. I've been receiving food to the same address earlier. Any online company that can't own up to its mistake in today's world, is only going to the ground (sooner than later). Or at least have a customer support that has the basic manners to talk to another human.",1
"experienced Zomato server crashes many times.sometimes takes longer to verify the order and can't cancel the order in such cases. Support is also not very supportive , usually answers all problems with same : we will take your feedback in note .",1
this app does not give any response for order you have placed when questioned for delay on delivery there is no response. you have to struggle to get through the restaurant and find out what happened.,1
"Delay , specially India Palace Restaurant it took more than one & half hour to deliver to my hous. Even my house nearby the Restuarant about 7 minuets walking . Very pad app they have no more options for food, no information about the order, no amount appear on the order!!",1
The best food delivery application . Very nice delivery .It was delivered in 15 mins only !!Absolutely amazing . When I used it first time I rated it for 1 star because there was no delivery on my location from another ID and.... they replied that we will cover your area and they did it . Very nice team zomato .,5
"Hated the app and the developers mind. It installed adware in my mobile. Now every now and then, the ads of zomato pop up on my mobile screen even after uninstalling it. Do not install if you do not want to be bombarded by unwanted advertisements.",1
"Worst experience ever, no proper chat support, automated pinup location is of 5km away from my given address and they canceled the order themselves, also charged cancelation fees from me, very poor experience. Will never use this app again.",1
Worst payment gateway,1
Good service Good service,5
"The worst experience ever. The customer care numbers are all invalid and when you try and chat with them through zomato chat, they are useless. I contacted them within 1 week of my issue and they say that its too late to do anything about it.",1
App shall improve customer support as I am paying money for delivery I am expecting them at least to tell me if there is an issue or delay with the delivery If the resturant is facing delays they have to inform in advance that this order will take long time to complete not only charge me money and then ask me to call the resturant myself Question. If zomato is not delivering why are they charging 6 dhs?,2
"There is one bad thing is that there is no option to review or modify the order. if order is placed by mistake it should be cancelled, but for this customer has to pay full amount without getting the product.",2
"very bad service! even if you report an issue they will ask for photos. who will think of taking photo before having a food? if something happened after having a food which resulted in a health damage, will they still ask for pic od what we had as part of their policy?? not at all understandable customer service.. needs to improve a lot for sustaining in india.",1
"Worst app ever. I ordered my food at 9:40pm and till 10:40pm they were showing reaching in 10minutes and out of the blue they cancelled the order leaving me with no option but to eat Parle G biscuits at night instead of dinner. Disastrous management and unreliable, redundant communications system.",1
App is too slow and my 1 order has delivered to me after 1 hour and 2 order after 33 min i want my refund as it is your policy of 30 min,1
Easy to use. App responded fast. My bill for food was 485rs. But later on the final amout shown was 529 rs. Actually they offered discount but instead they added extra amount. What this amount for was not show n in the bill.,4
"Order for food since yesterday till today I am still waiting after they have debited my card. I don't advice anyone to pay first. Food cant see, my money cant see. Even the chat window has been block cant chat with them anymore. Be careful with the way you deal with services like this",1
They cancelled my order because it was raining and they never communicate this. I ve been waiting for 1.5hrs the food and it never arrived. In every country rains and not because of that the deliveries stop. And in any case they should communicate that the order was cancelled. Really not serious!,1
I sent an email where BOX8 cancelled my order just within minutes I ordered my food. The order never left the restaurant. I sent an email regarding the same without the screenshot. Now they're taking a stand that order left and my address was wrong whereas soon after I ordered from another place which delivered me to the same address. Zomato robbed me and ain't planning on refunding. Accept errors in your process instead of laying off them onto customers. Worst experience. Uber eats rocks!👍,1
"I had ordered food from zomato and had paid in advance for that. Now after a while I learned that the order has been cancelled because they were not able to reach me, not just that they penalized me with entire amount and now I do not have food nor the amount. I would not have paid in advance if I did not want to get the food. The reason is the delivery guys beguile the company sometimes saying the customer is not accepting the order and they cancel it themselves and take the food for free.",1
After waiting 1hour for my order i recieved cold inedible food which i had to throw away and when reported the issue the customer service was of no help constantly giving lame excuses and i had to pay for the order which i couldn't eat. they have no refund policy or any help process. All they do is give excuses and con people to pay for inedible food.,1
"Worse service, ruined my new year party. Ordered on 1st Jan 2020, 1AM but food never delivered, restaurant didn't responded any calls even after repeated call. Chat support was also not able to provide any solution. So, if u don't wanna ruin ur special day then don't order food from Zomato.",1
"Very customer unfriendly people. Very customer unfriendly policies. Pathetic customer service. Hopeless service. You cannot cancel your order, modify your order or request or any assistance. My sincere advise to all friends is to stay away from this unfriendly app so that you can save your money & time.",1
Worst service . Don't opt for pro. They r cheating customers. No proper response in customer care .,1
"Very bad , non professional service, on 10/10/19 at 1pm i have placed order which were suppose to reach after 40 minutes, order been delivered my address at 4.30 pm, thats mean after 3 hrs when i had no need of that food, from today I ll never book my order through zomato. This is a disgusting app.",1
"Horrible app. Have been using this since long. Horrible customer service in case of mistakes. They make you pay for all their incorrect orders. Take too long to deliver in rush hours, give wrong food but do not give replacement or refund. Uninstalling this horrible app.",1
"Almost everytime I got my delivery late by half n hour or more. On this there reply is restaurant has not handover the products, delivery partner was having problem with vehicle. Why I have to suffer everytime. If you guys have any problem then you have to notified delivery will take more than hour so we can go for another option.",1
Be careful about the payment method. You don't get to talk to the customer care. I have not been refunded my few orders despite my hectic efforts to get it back. Only solution was to keep myself away from using it.,1
"Sometimes service is fine, but when it's not they don't do anything. I have received wrong orders so many times. I rarely get refund for these kinds of mistake. It's so annoying at this point.",2
No options for refund if delivery is late. Other apps have the same. My order was late by 1.45 hours and i couldn't do anything other than wait. My whole afternoon was ruined because of zomato.,3
Guys. People are not delivering orders and once raised support query the order seems to get delivered without me getting my actual food at all. I waited for 2 hours and the delivery man wasn't even reachable. This is insane. I have to wait for support team to revert on my message,1
Horrible experience. There is absolutely no check on quality of restaurants they onboard. Lately so many restaurants have been delivering poor quality food and all zomato says is that they are looking into the matter. Worst part is that we pay for they mismanagement of choosing restaurant partners.,1
"The app is worst I just ordered 2 plates of cheese tomato and got 1 and when I asked the delivery boy wheather its 1 or 2 he said its 2 and when opened it was just 1.. After calling the incharge over there he said ""I don't know anything u can go to the restaurant and talk over there"" I said that I will report about zomato he said that u are free to do that. In short its the worst app..",1
"Zomato and subway are super annoying. Ordered food from subway through zomato for the 4th time and each time i have received incomplete order. They either forget to give pepsi or they dont have and still accept orders or they are just ignorant. They then tell you to wait for another half an hour to get your pepsi delivered or tell you to either refund the money, but if i have ordered a pepsi with my sub how do i eat it witgout pepsi, they never understand the frustration, they are just more than happy to refund those 52 bucks. Swiggy works so much better.",1
Worst app i have ever used swiggy is much better then zomato. Zomato provide wrong no. To the delivery boy and even dont support and give response to the query and one more thing no updated status of the delivery and no tracking of the food...and i have the proof of the delivery recipt which shows the wrong no. Of mine,1
This app doesn't deserve even a star. I will give them zero they dont have a customer service and you can't contact them or call if you have complaints and their drivers are rude and they won't give your money back they will say they don't have changes and they will leave this happened many times every time they will have the same problem and the same excuse and you can't do anything because you will not find someone to discuss it with it the worst experience I have ever had,1
Too good to be true. Only download if you don't value your money...thank you,1
customer service gives totally wrost experience after given payment of food and any quality issues arises then you have to only waste your time and money in given order and service team will make you wait more than 1 hour and due to this delay quality of food become from bad to baddest... such a disappointing service team and i never recommend to any one,2
"very satisfied with the service & overall experience with the app. keep up the good work. on a side note, your ""valets"" could be trained a little better to find addresses and talk to customers.",5
"3 stars just because it has more than half of the restaurants that doesn't deliver food. When I press the delivery option, it still doesn't show the restaurants that deliver. it is the most irritating thing.",3
"Service was very fast. Faster than I expected. Eat-fit food was perfect. Nothing less than described in the menu. Fairly to say value to the money. Tasty, healthy also packed very hysterically.",5
Not going to order from zomato anymore. They don't have proper communication support. If your order gets cancelled then there's no option for refund. And you don't even get to Know about the status of your food and what they do with it. By using this app you have no control on your order. Better if you can go to the restaurant and buy it yourself.,1
Really very good app. I am satisfied with this app. The way of packing food is simply superb. And their sincere work in these threatning days was awesome. Thanks zomato for satisfying our needs but I am little dissapointed with the quality of food .,5
Wrost service at cancellation and following cooking instructions. Valet don't know English. Valet don't understand the delivery address. Fake Offers that doesn't exit. Don't remove old offers. Bad policies for cancellation. Had to suffer a lot.,1
It is the most worst application. If you order through it you will waste your money. Item ordered will not be delivered. They will never solve your problem. I will request you all not to use it at all. It provides the worst service.,1
only thing I appreciate is fast delivery but on cancelling order why u guys give penalty of not ordering via cash on delivery? there was a resn why I cancelled order bcs of time taken... That's totally not fair ..I cannot order via cod nd second thing is why the delivery man forces us to give ratings before giving order?? that's our decision not yours...,2
I could give 5 star instead of 3. but the reason for rated 3 stars because of the zomato delivery boys. at the door most of the delivery boys are demanding to give five star rating without handover the food to us. and it's feels like they are ordering to give complete starts without tast the food. some times i swich to uber eats or swiggy to avoid this kind of worst situation with delivery boys. hope you people consider this feedback in good manner and make them educate in respective way.,3
"most trusted app to order food online. There's always a assurity that food will be delivered on time and in its best conditions and if not due to any reson, they make sure you get it changed. how can i not talk about their offers, they always have some or the other offers going which helps students like us to not sleep empty stomach. thank you Zomato.",5
Been using this app since I came to AUH. Very useful specially when I am too lazy to cook or to go out to buy food. Although there are times that the order takes long to be delivered.,4
"Foodies, please use Swiggy & Uber eats. This is my first order on zomato & worst experience ever. I cancelled my order within 2 minutes of order placement and there was no information about penalty during cancellation, but when checked for refund, zomato is claiming as whole order value as penalty (rs.150). i have used Uber eats & swiggy and cancelled my order even after 10 mins(no penalty was charged).",1
My favourite app as they try to listen to your queries as far as possible... but I have typed this as was thoroughly impressed with Zomato as they genuinely care for their riders as well. . have provided them with raincoats which was missing till recent deliveries and I felt sad seeing them getting drenched... Even in small cities like Jorhat where the no of employees are quite few.. they have tried to maintain their fraternity.,5
I have ordered food online then after payment my order has cancelled with the reason that u my number is not reachable. But I have mentioned my house number and location. This is not the fault of the customer if the network is not reachable.,1
Poor servicing. Most of the restaurants there are unavailable to serve food most of the times. It happened to me twice while Its been 10 days I am still waiting for my refund.,1
"Worst food ordering app. Bunch of cheaters and fraudsters. Added on time delivery option to order. Delivery agent arrived late. When asked for refund, these fraudsters say that delivery agent delivered food on time. Chatted with agent. Agent is not ready to call me nor escalate to manager. Says that he is the last point of contact. Emailed them. Always same reply that they delivered on time and they can't escalate and it is final resolution. Wowo what a service. Bunch of fraudsters and cheater",1
"Honestly, just don't really have anything bad to say about the app. It's made food-hunting so much easier. I love the layout of the app, the way everything has been categorised; and being able to call through the app as well!",5
Zomato is only made for ravage their customer... If some one by mistake deleted wrong delivery address and within next 2 second he tries to change the delivery address they refuse to accept the request and deducted around 50% of paid money... I am using this app from last 2 year and every time I use to give tip for rider . But now I feel zomato doesn't care about their regular and good customer But if they cancel the order from their side than no additional charge would be provided by them.,1
"This app only became available in my location only after ubereats became the Zomato app. Compared to ubereats, it's a little cluttered and confusing. There are too many elements and it takes time to get the hang of it. The offers given are plenty. Tye navigation system is accurate. Overall, it's alright.",3
"Useless for me. This app does not let me pay using zeta meal card. It allows me to add the card but if I select the card for payment, swipe option does not come on the screen. The same card works well with food@work app. Also Zomato crashes if I try to change notification settings.",1
Experince is good but food packaging is not as much better improve food packagind and fast delivery,4
"very very bad service.. doesn't care about customer and their time. they will treat customers as beggers and will be very rude in service calls as well. The driver support people are real idiots, they never care about customers and they always back thier drivers. When Zomato dont know how to handle their employees forget about winning customer trust and leave this business. USELESS Service. Go to hell.",1
Further to my last message as would not let me finish.... they ensure it wont happen again and it does . I have tens and tens of examples but let me put my last 2 orders into perspective I ordered rit room 1 hour 45 mins to arrive and it turned up cold... theybtokd me the rider had multiple order to carry out and mine was last... so obviously reason why come they refunded 12 dirhams when I told then it is bot edible nobody wants cold french fries or a mixed grill. Time after I ordered fast food,1
"Well the reason for giving 1 star rating is based upon the fact that, zomato has hiked the prices on their site, i have compared with the original price list of the Vendor "" Flavours of Chakhna "". Every single item price has been spuked by 10% - 20% which clearly unacceptable and basically they are playing with the prices for their own benifit. It's really bad. I wish i could post you the snapshot.",1
"Zomato, its not showing the right location.. i think there is some problem in zomato. app i also try from another.. phone.. but no change . Because of that , i am disfaver the app.. and i think owner shold recover. it . then and then its the best of .. ,,🎷🎷😍",3
If you are looking for food delivery please avoid. Swiggy and Uber eats are far better. If your order is running late which it will in zomato and you want to chat with support it will be a discovery to reach that option and once you do the responses you get it not worth the discovery,2
The best food delivery app yet. Various choices. amazing offers. Live tracking map glitches some times but the delivery guys are efficient. They call up and gives u proper updates. Lovely. Keep it up.,5
Pretty convenient but I feel there should be one more step before hitting place order. like a confirmation maybe? Because once I hit place order while I chose the wrong item from the menu and they refused to cancel or refund. And that was quite disappointing.,4
Always there is a location issue appears whenever I ordered something from Zomato and lack of delivery boys. Sometimes it cancels order itself after 30-40 mins of waiting showing that there is no man for picking up my order. Very bad service from Zomato. 😠😠😠,2
I ordered food on 7th February 2020 at 9:48pm And the delivery boy who was assigned to pick the order was not moving towards restaurant. I tried chatting with Zomato rep regarding the issue and they were not able to give proper support. I called the delivery guy and he said he is not working today. Now the food was supposed to be delivered at 10:30pm and no one is going to pick up the food. I connected with Zomato chat support to ask them to change the delivery boy which they were not ready do,1
"the aap in all is good! it has made life simpler. but more care should be taken towards the packaging and on time delivery,often i see careless packaging and delay in delivery,moreover the restaurants should be given clear instructions to use authentic package and avoid spilling of food.",3
"It's so difficult to place order. We cannot fine the exact item that we want to order, it keep showing the restaurant names. I keep ordering from Swigy and it simple, but the their problem is they are not available 24/7.",1
I've installed and used this food app for the first time to know the difference from the other food app.In the first time I had the bad experience. The delivery system and customer care team are really the worst I've ever seen.Finally I've lost my money.I suggest everybody to not use this app,1
"As an app to explore the restaurant it is very good. But as per as deliveey is concerned, very late service. I jad ordered Pizza feom Cheeliza which is just 600 mt from my home, and zomato took 55 minutes to deliver it and it was cold by that time. I will not try Zomato again.",1
zomato provides good service but many times the order gets placed automatically when I just place the item in cart . This is very disappointing . and even if I inform them within a second of ordering then too they don't cancel it.,1
Excellent in the field of food delivery system. Very accurate and responsive customer grievance redressal. Thank you very much and very happy. I wish Zomato to scale new heights in future,5
Good foods but the cost of the delivery charge is very lot so kindly minnas the rate of the delivery charges,5
After selecting home address zomato captured some other address. After one and hour of wait I came to know order was cancelled. Everyone was so hungry yet Again I had to wait for half hour for food from local restaurant. Very disappointing service by tomato.!!!!,1
"Doing great job but still need to improve in the form proper procedure in case there is a complaint about the food, and try to add more number restaurants and even ice cream providers to your list.",4
If there is possibility of 0.5 star or negative star i would have surely given it a negative star. Because... This app is just a platform to lure people... They said for new users they are giving 5 new user coupons of 50% off upto ₹100... I used one and for rest all... It's not showing the remaining 4 coupons.... ALSO ... this app doesn't show seperately a offers section like the swiggy.... That's why I feel Zomato is digusting....,1
"This is THE WORST APP you will find for delivering food. If you are lucky, you will able to order your food without them looting your money. They cancelled my order automatically saying they delivery boy called my phone and I was unavailable. But i did not recieve a single call from him. they charged me penalty for the entire order and gave me 0 refund for a mistake that was either committed by the delivery boy or zomato. (That's for Zomato to figure out).",1
App couldn't able to locate the proper location and moreover the customer care told me to receive the order from that location failure which my amount got deducted paid already. Moreover the delivery boy was so rude and showing attitude as he is some kind of boss. Zomato should either scrap their service or be customer friendly to run the business.,1
very bad service not providing the quality of food and if you raise complain about it customer service is bad I am using it from more the 6 month talking to service center is really a trouble one reply and you will send about your queries or experience agent will not reply you for long and just send you sorry for inconvenience and not gonna solve your problem there are no quality standards for the food not quality standards for the food they are serving,1
"Good app, but sometimes evn a big names like empire messup its name with things like, last time thy just sent half of the order for another half had to struggle til 12 in night, tht was more thn 3 hours wait, so cancelled all, didn't gt enough timely support frm Zomato, aftr lot of struggle Zomato gve money coupon, thanks fr tht, bt empire ws rude nt customer friendly, Zomato shld have taken some action against them or hd sme follow up atleast next day morning.only refund was nt al i ws looking.",3
"Poor customer service. Even when you explain an issue with the restaurant, they say we will investigate and in return a response is received stating, ""we apologise, this won't happen again"". Swiggy is far more better.",1
"I am from vapi location i have marked my current location and mentioned delivery location, still your delivery person is arguing and misbehaving and didn't delivered my order and i have report the issue so the same thing happen customer representative also reject my order n didn't refund my amount. I have mentioned the account so you guys have to delivered at that location. Worst app for vapi, gujarat",1
"Worst customer service experience in recent times! It's been over 90 mins. since I placed my order & yet its not delivered. Tried contacting with Zomato but no response for over 15 mins. now. Tried calling the pickup executive who said his app was not working and that ""if it comes back online he will try to deliver the order ""??? Really frustrating experience! Wouldn't use nor not recommend!",1
The payment services can never be contacted. They are probably purposely doing this so that we are forced to make cash payments and leave out all the discounts that come along with it. Kindly please improve your payment servers.,1
Very bad No refund,1
"Good to see Zomato back like the initial days. Keep this up guys, our expectations as customers are really high and yes that makes your task more important requiring 200% efforts! Would be happy to write feedbacks for each delivery if you'll are consistent again in delivering quality service to customers :)",5
Loved this app. It's has good discounts and offers And the delivery is awesome during nights.,5
"App has a major issue. When I installed the app with my Google id, it auto updated with raipur address. When I ordered they did book my order with the auto updated address and upon cancellation of the order, I didn't get my refund.",2
It horrible.i have trying to reach to chat and connect for my missing order. But its not working,1
"The widest range of restaurants I've seen on any food delivery app. Nice service, quick delivery time. It would be better if the offers work with cash on delivery.",4
"worst app ever. money deducted from my bank account still in the app it's showing payment incomplete. the worst part is the support system says contact restaurant, restaurant is not helping me out. No response from anyone from zomato. uninstalling the app right away.",1
very bad experience ... if by mistake order from you guys cancelled .. and after a second you send a message for not to cancel .. kindly deliver my order ..they will not want to make chat with you and not refund and their chat wait time is nearly one hour very frustrating...dont install go for swiggy ok,1
time best kedping,5
pathetic application to go for least amount of help they would provide you with the order and that too the order has been wrongly listed and served by the restaurant and still they can't help you with it because it is beyond their control. i have uninstalled your application would be last in priority if at all i have to think.,1
Good categorization of food items and Showing the stars of the hotel helps to know the quality of hotel..,4
"Worst customer experience they are just getting money minded .... extra MRP and heavy delivery charges doesn't satisfy them. I got my order cancelled by mistake and they charged 75 rs as cancellation fees on my 60rs order.😅😂😂 I have good experience with other food online vendors they are customer friendly and will definitely help you out no ( food app like @box8 , @zomato ,@foodpanda) etc does but Swiggy style seems now😅 cheat India at best!",5
very bad experience I faced with the first order.. I used the coupon for 50% discount but on delivery I had to pay full amount.. Tried to chat with zomato but no luck.. since the delivery boy waiting for money I had to pay full amount... really disappointed...,1
They provide fresh food with minimum range of prices. But some of the delivery boys doesn't take care of the food. Zomato is doing a great help providing instant food delivery. They should take care about the delivery.,5
Pathetic service!! I had place an order last night. And it shows my order would be delivered with in half an hour. But after half an hour the delivery guy calling me and asking me to cancel the order from my side just because he wont be able to deliver my order on time!! I mean is this the things are we expecting from Zomato?? And i place my order on 9:52PM and at last he dint deliverd my order infact he canceled my order on 11Pm. Totally unsatisfied with this and i want the suitable revert on t,1
"My order got placed, amount deducted from account, but order is not confirmed, waiting for 40 minutes just to get confirmation on the order. Unsatisfactory service and app performance, app keeps showing problems frequently.",1
"Not able to sign in through Google. It asks to update app to sign in through Google, whereas I have just downloaded the app 5 mins back. Not able to use Promo Code when order is placed without signing in. Also, only 3 options of payment method are available.",1
"Why is that these days whenever I open this app to order anything, its servers are down? The restaurants which I choose don't accept any orders. This happens everytime. I thought it would be a once or twice a thing but these days ita happening very frequently. Please improve your servers",4
"Cash on delivery option is not given due to my cancellation of an order. But i have no other choice of payment. So i have to uninstall this app due to its limitations. When we r adjusting to the problems in orders or delivery options, why should we face such problems? Please Zomato Team, u have to look into to this matter the sooner.",4
"No Food, No Refund Food was not delivered to me and waiting for refund for 10 days. Daily chatting with zomato guys and getting fake assurance that amount will be refunded within 24 hours. This is ridiculous. There are hell lot of food delivery apps in market go with them....uninstall zomato",1
No number to speak with Customer Service. Only chat option is given and that too with an AI Bot. I put in specific instructions for the valet to carry change and I get 20 rupees less than what I should get because the valet didn't carry change even after putting my instructions via the chat. Really appalling standard of service. 👎😡,1
Worst app ever! Says super fast delivery but every time it's delayed by 1hour (ordered at least 10times). I don't why do i even pay the delivery charges. It's better to directly call the restaurant and order. Horrible experience!,1
"Chat window has problem. incase of issue with your order, the chat window takes you to camera but do not allow to share the pic. I am unsure if it is a genuine bug or created one by Zomato to reduce refunds. Really annoying.",1
I've a suggestion. The delivery charges and taxes should visible along with the item value. So that it would more appropriate for order. Coz there are so many things which is hidden customers feel like.,1
its the best app where I can search food or restaurant of my choice. The delivery is fast and staffs are really friendly. please keep up good work. 5 star to you and all the best.,5
Never order your food through prepaid option as once the money gets deducted they will make sure the order doesn't reach to you and also the money will not be reffunded.I recently faced this issue whre everytime I order via cod option they come and give at the exact same gps location provided but this time have ordered through card and all they did was plan and rob my money.Declined by telling that the location was incorrect and cancelled by themself only hence my money never cant be refunded.,1
"Many a times, they cancel the order after taking 1 hr. The app will show that your food is being prepared but suddenly you will get a call after an hour from Zomato that the restaurant is not responding, therefore we are cancelling your orders..",1
"You guys deliver food faster than expected. Easy order selection, can see the restaurants original menu card and order easily, even from far away restaurants. Executives are always polite and hygienic. Keep up doing the awesomeeee work!!A 10/10 for delivery and food both😊",5
"Worst online food app. As because it has increased very high rate of money by increasing dilevery fee, distance fee, tax, and much more which is more than our food which we order. Like our food prise is Rs70 or Rs90 but the dilevery charge and distance fee and tax and packing charge is Rs60. Which is not in our buget.",1
They will charge you but your food will not get delivered. Happened twice in a day that i have placed and order both the time amount got deducted but food was not delivered. The executives and restaurants are too irresponsible to answer calls of the customer.,1
Zomato is one of the best food app. I usually order my food form zomato. Trust me guys it's very easy to order food from your favorite restaurants also in midnight. Basically I am a non socialise people I don't like party outside. If I have to party I just call my main friends and order food from zomato and I get my food so early. This is one of the best app in my phone. I get so many discounts on zomato and think this is the perfect gift for me thanks zomato for making my life so easy.,4
App is OK for info and order but Zomato Gold Membership is 100% useless and waste of money... Not valid on any decent buffet not valid on takeaways... I have taken Zomato Gold and Dineout Gourmet Pass and I must say Dineout is 1000 times better than this... As valid on all 5star buffets... Till date I am not able to use even single time due to this... Dont buy at all... Pathetically waste of money...,2
What the hell. The app crashes every time not even able to locate my home on the map. As soon as i press place order it asks to add address. when i manually add the address then it asks me to locate it on the map and it crashes tried it 10-15 times. Worst experience.,1
"love the app and their service, first was using Uber, but when we recieve the items the size / potion of the food we ordered are much smaller compared to the original, first thought as it will be like that only coz of our discounts and all, then accidentally used this and ordered the same item and was more than happy to know that , at the same discount and price got, a much ""bigger"" deal and their after service poll and all, make the service much more likeable , altogether loving it 😘😍",4
"very nice user experience, especially the payments are very quick. It has all the options like online and pickup orders, gold, restaurant search. So it's like all food solutions in one app.",5
It is a good app. Have a variety of places that you can go eat and they also provide categories of places. The only problem is that sometimes the accuracy of near by restaurant doesn't match and the UI of app keeps changing so it takes time to adjust to it,3
The chat service is not working anymore. First the food is late for an hour and then you wait on chat forever for someone to come online. At the end food is delivered before someone comes online.,1
Worst app. Worst customer support. No refunds given even for items not delivered. Happened many times. Support does not cooperate. Total nonsense. Waste of money and time.,1
Always recieved cold order and late order..swiggy better then zometo atleast we recieved ordrs on time,1
"Never picks up right location. would suggest that at the time of order, the location address is requested to be confirmed once again, so as to avoid incorrectly delivery.",1
Very bad.. Restaurants are okay but I have issue with the app particularly They don't respond to any complaint They don't give enough discounts Their other charges are so high that there's no point of the small amount of discount they offered And more than that they don't give any refunds,1
everytime creates problems to me always just fed up with this when there is no option to get from place they should not place the order only after placing after paying after 30mins they will slowly call and tell that some other problem and what about money? they after 7days it will be refunded is this fair? never gonna use this app,2
Really disappointed with zomato delivery.Ordered 4 ice pops from House of pops and I received only 2. If you really want to cheat your customers and want only to lure them with 50% off coupons and provide only half the product I ordered then better don't give discounts.Atleast then I guess I'll receive the full product which I ordered.And this was my first order from Zomato after you aquired ubereats and this is how I was treated. Ubereats was far better than Zomato. I was happy with ubereats.,1
"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!! NOT GOING TO ORDER EVER AGAIN!! App is showing food delivered even though food was not delivered, delivery boy not picking call. Customer care executive chat was even more disgusting and was full of dumb questions not even reading what i was saying and disconnected the chat rudely. DONT MAKE MISTAKE OF MAKING ONLINE PAYMENT IN ZOMATO! There is no guarantee food will get delivered and they will ask to check issues with your order rather than checking issue with delivery.",1
"Service is pretty bad, I cancelled an order which was by mistake, and I don't receive any refund or don't let me go all myself to pick the order., I'd rate 0 for this service, but sadly it isn't available.",1
"App needs lot of updates to be done. With new updated app , no rest. Address is showing only displayed when you make the payments till that time you dont know yet how far is your rest and how long it will take your order to come. Not satisfied. 😞😞😞.",1
I used this app daily but their new support system is really bad as they replaced real support with bot support and now none of my queries are solved by the stupid bot. Only reason I used zomato instead of swiggy was it's excellent support but now it's gone so am I. Reasons for uninstalling - once I paid for my order around 500 and they took the amount and order wasn't accepted and I didn't got my money back. Yesterday I ordered a combo and a beverage wasn't delivered and these didn't got solved,1
Very worst experience. Till now I lost 700Rs. Whenever I ask in the chat there is no response at all. There is no one who is responding. The food which we get is also not good sometimes. I have asked so many times for refund but till now I didn't get my money back. very worst!!! I'll never let anyone to use this app!!!,1
"After placing the order I received that order received, restaurant accepted, delivery on the way...... 90 minutes later and no order, when we called Dominoz they said the order has not been placed and they keep calling you and u put them on hold...... If u don't have power force to answer calls why u open???????!!!!!!!! Bad experience and this is the last time I will order through u, Delevroo and Talabat are way better and still there. Good luck with annoying more people.",1
Everything is good and awesome. I feel like the velvet should know the address and area very well. I suggest you to keep the people who knows their area so they can deliver fast. Not delivering in time.,3
"A very helpful app for getting information about restaurants and cuisines etc, BUT worst when it comes to ordering food online. The dilivery person cancels the order with out any consent of the person who have ordered no satisfactory customer service.",3
"very bad app. I ordered my food, it showed the delivery boy had picked it up and sometime later when I called him, his number came busy. I called him 4 time and his number was coming busy. My order got cancelled and my money didn't come yet. Worst app ever",1
today i ordered food of amount 464 due to some urgent reason i was not able to pick up the call at that moment but after two minutes when i was again calling message came that the order is cancelled.It is very unhelpful from your side please initiate the refund as soon as poosible.It would be very helpful if you give refund as soon.,1
Horrible chat/online customer support. one moment suport equals minimum 45mins.. save yourself the horror & call the restuarant directly!!,1
They are getting worse day by day.. even the restaurants they tie up with.. ordered breakfast got it at lunch time and as it was pre paid couldn't cancle cos they charge for cancellations. when raised multiple queries they diabled the chat option on APP. swith to swigy!,1
pathetic food. providing stale food.,1
Very bad experience.. ordered food in mojo pizza @5.30 pm and waited till 7 pm and called the hotel regarding delivery they said that it'll be delivered@7.30 but not happened and i call back them @7.40 and they just simply said that the order is cancelled and zomato doesn't even know about all these and shows my order status as on the way...,1
Very gud and fast service thanq zemato,5
good online food delivery app...Suggest: This app could be better if you show which resturants serve halal meat .....Complaint : For the same order I have seen much difference in price within 10 minutes..... the resturants are shown unavailable for a moment and again accept order after 5 minutes.... also there is surge fee applied sometimes even in good weather conditions,4
The app is okay but the customer service has a lot to improve. the delivery executives are only focused on the ratings and wont leave my door step until they give themselves rating. The 3 stars are only for the offers on orders and Zomato Gold.,3
Restaurant will accept the order and says will reach your food in 35 minutes. But after 35 minutes they message that there is no one to assign to deliver your food so they are cancelling. This is not the way to provide services to your customers.,1
Not able to chat with customer care. Everytime i try i get 'something went wrong' error. Today i ordered after a long time and still waiting for for delivery after 1 hour. There is no option to cancel delayed delivery.,1
Great Deals. Deep Discounts. Incredibly smooth User Interface. You do have to spend a fair amount of time finding just the right amount in your order to maximize discount benefits but that's okay I guess. Domino's minimum ₹300 order is a d**k move honestly.,5
"Dear Readers, Please be advised during night never use this app 4 out of 5 times the delivery guys took off without even notifying and the worst part is the customer service people will still take their own to time to 'investigate' the obvious. Extremely disappointed.",1
it should ask for mark location every time of an order but it doesn't ask we have to manually do it every time if forgotten...kind of disappointed with the UI after the order placed you can't edit the location (should edit atleast around 500m),3
"I thought it was better than other's like swiggy and dominos , but come to know that ZOMATO also do cheat peoples.My experience was good at the first 3 months and by January 2020 they started giving me wrong address after ordering with my correct location .... but it was not once i got this same incident twice.... when i contacted there executive they told me that the order is being prepared and it will arrive soon even the location is wrong..... and forced me to cancell my order ..Do replay...",1
"loving the offers and experience of the app. In all honesty, i haven't used anyother food ordering apps in a while. its been zomato for almost a good month now. keep up the good work and the amazing offers.",5
there is an issue with the application. it is taking lot of time on loading. I even tried closing app multiple time but still problem is persisting. application is not responding. kindly note that I do have good internet connectivity as well as have updated the app too.,1
"1...Fast service,2....tie ups with good restaurants, 3...the searching option can be more easier need to work a bit on searching option 4....Huge variety 5... Dedicatedly working to satisfy the customers. Keep up the great work 👌",5
"They have ruined the app with the latest version. First of all, the zomato easy is gone. No more cheap meals. Also, in all the restaurants menu is not showing properly. Some kind of bug maybe. Please fix it asap.",1
These people only concern about delivery issues. The food and customer satisfaction is not an issue for these guys. Waste of money and time. Better to order from swiggy or any other food delivery apps. They might not always give you coupons but still care for your concern.,1
Cool n' easy,4
Pathetic service....you order the food and wait for an hr suddenly you will get updates in the app your order is delivered restaurant will not take responsibility and when you will contact zomato people they will tell they are not able to contact delivery boy and your order is cancelled and they will refund your money in next 48 hours....please sleep empty stomach for today.....what a shameless service people are working for zomato......disgusting.....i will recommend go for another option..,1
unrealistic delivery timelines displayed. have had multiple orders with over an hour of delay. you need to have a time bound delivery mechanism telling hungry people to wait another 15 minutes after an hour of wait is unacceptable.,1
"Lol remove that ""safe"" from the logo we know you don't make food yourself and how you got control over the delivery service. But anyway good service :3",3
"Thank you zomato, coz now your delivery/taxes & charges cost us as much as the food itself. Instead i opt for other food delivering services. ""ZomatoPro"" becomes useless because your additional charges almost exceeds the benefits of the coupon. What a shame.",1
Don't use this app. don't BUY GOLD it's a scam. I hope this review gets attention so I'm going to be thorough.. I've been ordering every other day using this app and every month I have atleast three instances where my payment is made online and yet the order is not registered.. Zomato owes me a few thousands just in compensation. Being an engineer and understand the application can falter but your helpline promises help in a week's time. EVERY WEEK. To top it off Gold is the WORST investment!,1
I was placing an order and looking for option to apply my coupon code but the order got placed in cash... I immediately asked the cse to cancel the order even before the restraunt could confirm the order... Bt the cse was busy giving excuses and explaining me the policy instead of cancelling it... By which the order was confirmed and i had to pay for not eating..,1
"The promo codes are no doubt good and the ZOMATO CHAT service is helpful too but sometimes, the application malfunctions. It does not show the option for cash payment and takes our money if we cancel the order due to some valid reasons. I am not satisfied with its working.",2
"Worst operations, my last many orders were cancelled after waiting for many hours. They think refunded money can be eaten instead of food. All they do is that they will cancel the order and then you and your family is on your own. They do not realise that people have hope that food is confirmed but at the very end when you have run out of all options they will pull the rug under your feet and kill all your hope for you and your family. Whole family is thinks as person unable to provide food.",1
They say you can use top60 5 times on food orders but it doesn't validate after one use. On top of that customer care promises they'll provide cashback once you place the order but that never gets credited. All the time swiggy giving 20% discount on the same restaurant. Can you guys stop misdirecting users. People who order everyday don't have the luxury for such gimmicks.,1
this app used to be so much better. whoever redesigned the current one needs a slap around the ears.,2
"Even if food is not delivered or wrong item or damaged they will assure of giving refund or coupon which zomato dont give later saying sone execuses. Their mail itself contradicts each other. Update: i sent couple of mails, but response from your support stuff was to execuse them as they can not provide me the refund or coupon though they admitted mistake was from zomato side, it was funny interacting with tour customer care executives",1
No option to cancel the order which was used to be there ... Food and money was wasted as two orders were placed at a time and that was happened as the restaurant had delayed the confirming the order.. worst experience and customer support couldn't do anything as per their company terms,1
"Conduct training programs for your delivery men, as they do not really know how to use maps and navigate on roads. If I go to a new city, I cant know all the paths to guide the delivery person. They have to see the location and reach me. By the time my food gets delivered, it gets cold and not very edible.",2
Excellent app for ordering food. But the most problem. No selecting food restaurant. The foods often we order such as combo. Or exclusive meal. Is often. satisfactory. Or. Maybe litte bad at sometimes.,3
i was checking for discount instead of going back. i accidently placed order & charges immediately got deducted from paytm wallet.. ever before the restaurant confirmation i cancelled the order all the amount got deducted even after repeated request to refund the money after cutting penalty no positive response from zomato .,1
this is a very nonsense app . a delivery man told me that I am not responding the phone call but there is not a single missed call in my phone . and he started arguing with me . thank God I had done cash on delivery or else my money would be gone . I like to say all the people that don't use this app or else your money will we gone swiggy is far times better than this app .,1
"This application have no support to deal with urgent issues. The rider it chooses are unprofessional. The way it deal with customers and merchants is very arbitrary. It does not care for customers, or marchants it's just focused on money making by hook or crock. Even if their is problem with rider or app the customer call restaurant and theaten them to do bad things or even ask Zomato to give money back. Sadly Zomato even do that and cause lose to Marchant and in case of Marchant it's same",1
It is very bad to say that the order was canceled an hour after it was received.,1
Liking the new UI but there are some things I'm not able to access and that's a bother. 1. Unable to see my Zomato level and the level charts. 2. Unable to see my status as an expert in different areas. I don't know if this is an issue or if this was dropped completely because such features should not be dropped.,3
I m having very much trouble regarding location tracking and address for order n refund is not issued too by saying its cancellation policy ....its 2nd time in a day n my order is not delivered today on my birthday n with this I m logout from app and nvr evr install it to mk any order...not satisfied with my last order and payment issue.,1
"The app is good.....but eventually u will face bad n worst experience of delivery sytem n even the zomato executive are also not helping the customer, they are supporting the delivery boys....the customer is supposed to pay for the food but is it the duty of the customer to collect the order from different place?",1
"Absolutely sucks!.,i had mistakenly clicked cash on delivery and ordered and so i had to cancel my order ,now I'm not allowed to use cash on delivery because i had cancelled earlier...,it sucks ,swiggy is way better ,since then i alway use swiggy,zomato is the worst..,dont download this app use swiggy instead...",1
I would like to give zero rating for this current order as no food was delivered. Moreover when the call was made to the person who was supposed to be delivering he said i came at your doorstep and couldn't contact you. I was standing outside my house throughout. I can tell that this person is lying. After waiting for an hour no food was delivered ultimately. Very bad service overall and bad experience.,1
Customer service should be improved ...refunds sometimes processed too late sometimes not processed ....rest everything is manificent from discounts to food packaging and delivery guys are f***ing fast enough to get your food to you before you expect,3
"Refund and replacement of order becomes cumbersome when food is not good or delivery problem is there,prices after discount is equal to that which is available in menu at restaurant place itself ie discount is just a bait so that people order more and more in real we purchase at more price than at restaurant",1
"On time service provided , nicely packed, deliciously served .",5
DO NOT DOWNLOAD OR HAVE PATHETIC SERVICE... They do not have phone support and chat support is too worst they will reply 15 mins once and u will get different item then what you order. Felt swiggy is best because of customer support is quick.. After that upto you when you go through bad experiences you will know zomato and remember what i told in case you download.,1
"hi zomato, here in Bangalore, past 30 mins zomato homepage is not opening , not only for me , maximum of my friends in different location, and ordering page also not opening, if it continues you loose max no of customers, now i am also going to order from swiggy,... please rectify the bugs in your app",3
"Be careful with online Orders. The Customer Support team of Food Delivery Section is Pathetic, Lethargic and work with Zero Accountability. They are not bother about quality of the food delivered to you after the payment is made. Same way the incidence of zomato delivery boy eating the food on street meant for customers. I tried contacting these buggers hundred times for reporting issue with the food quality but failed to get any reply nor any Refunds.",1
"A useless chat system, although they claim to solve any issues within 48 hours, in reality they don't even reply after contacting them multiple times. Simply put, try to avoid ordering from them instead use swiggy or uber eats atleast they reply to your issues.",2
"overall itbwas a great app, but sadly very bad customer service! they will keep on telling you they will fix the problem but nothing ever happens, it was my fav app but now i found many alternatives for it. if you ever faced problems with zomato just delete it don't ask for the CS help.",1
Money is deducted from my account but it shows payment couldn't be processed. No way to inform either zomato or Bikanervala. Zomato support chat is useless where we cannot write our concerns but can only choose from the option they provide. When calling on bikanervala given number then they are picking the call and then without saying anything just disconnecting the call. Feeling CHEATED ZOMATO. Please return my money back.,1
"highly disappointed with Zomato's food delivery system. they don't provide any call details of customer care, and you end up waiting for 40-45 minutes just to see a someone assigned for the delivery. my order was cancelled without any delivery guy being assigned.",1
very bad experience....both food and delivery status is zero.....1 rating is enough...,1
"Zero stars would be more acceptable. I was just told to ""take the hint"" when they refused to rectify a very bad situation with my order, to which they took the blame but wouldn't rectify. Do not use this app.",1
"Really disappointed with their service. At one point in time was really loyal to Zomato but of late their services has really taken a dip. From late deliveries , to rolling back Zomato Gold, to missing items on delivery, to fewer restaurants in comparison to competitor - I have seen it all from Zomato",1
All good. sometimes no order take. why no take no no. in good faith I wrote. please order take all time. emergency time normal time stomach hungry feel but when check no order take say that no order can take now why no ? anyway pertaining to the issues that I have faced I can explain that the service is excellent.the delivery staff are usually very good punctual and polite. keep up the good job. but ensure that orders are taken always.,4
"Zomato is becoming worse day by day. I have not received an order. They are soo busy that it has been 5 days and I have not got any response from them. Every time I try to chat they tell to send a mail. I even mailed them but as expected, NOTHING.",1
"Zomato chat causes the app to crash. Food ordered was inedible and tried contacting zomato, but no contact number and zomato chat was causing the app to crash. So, I'm left with no food at 11:50 pm and an app that doesn't work. Great going, Zomato!",1
The navigation on the rider's end is getting worse day by day. Zomato is giving a 5 min route a loy of stretch and making it 40 minutes by going in an opposite direction. Plus there's no way to give a feedback on the navigation.,1
"I dont have option to give less then 1 star, if there is an option i would have gave negative 100. Worst experience every time",1
"If you order same food at the same time from swiggy and zomato , you ll get swiggy delivery first and then after 45 mins to hours delay zomato ll deliver . Support could only say sorry every time but they never try to improvise their process. I wouldn't recommend anyone ro use zomato , instead please use swiggy",1
This is the worst application as far as consumer grievance is concerned. Even after receiving spilled food a mere refund of 29.75 was given for the food which was about 200. And after repetitive mails too... They don't respond on mails either. Wish I could have chance to give them negative stars as well,1
It doesn't give order updates...live tracking does not work...does not have offers...and delivery time...took them more than an hour to deliver food from a place just 10 mins away! Swiggy is way better ontime delivery...great offers and live tracking works!,2
This app change the ordered items after bill payment. Also if order is cancelled then they didn't refund the money. Also the support from Zomato is very bad. They didn't take any responsibility of the order once you paid the bill.,1
"Multiple bugs especially related to payment page. One resolution leads to another problem. For example, on selecting paytm payment option, few days back page was hanging, now page is open but you cant put any money for payment as its not taking any input",1
Worst experience not once but thrice I ordered from dada boudi and due to some network issues my number was unreachable. They cancelled the order and my money was not refunded. As soon as my number was available I called and requested the delivery boy to return my order but obviously he was helpless. I had a chat on zomato..and they provided me no help at all and not even refunded my money. This should be reported as it is a serious issue. They have no alternative for such issues.,1
the worst app to order food from the will make sure that they charge you money ...and if the food take 50 minutes late they the said time all the agents say is theres nothing they can do I request everyone order cash on delivery so if the rider is late more then the said time you have the option to cancel your order ZOMATO IS A THIEF,1
There's something seriously wrong with the app. I had cancelled an order and my pay on delivery option has stopped working for ALL restaurants. Please let me know how to manage the issue.,1
"what's the use of an application if we can't cancel our order if its taking soo long to accept..me have to wait and wait till the things get sorted or an executive reach the restaurant and gets it confirmed.. and mainly the refund issue, which always says next 7 working days.. kyu bhai paisa to 2 min kaat liya.. wapas dene ko 7 dinn?? no fair enough I think.",1
"Please see Google review also before ordering ,",1
"I mean, there was an offer on Zomato that I wanted to avail, but it got ordered before I could check the total amount to be paid or apply the promocode. Then the only way I could cancel it was only if I agree to not pay cash on delivery ever again, even though I responded to cancel immediately and it was there fault in the first place",2
"Worst app.. All are fake offers and fake services.. The costs for all items mentioned here are more than double of the cost of hotel prices.. Zomato is charging more taxes than existing tax, and even delivery charges are different for different customers (non zomato gold) for same restaurant order. Zomato not even paying delivery charges to delivery boys as mentioned in the order summary. The taxes from same hotel for different customers is also different. Please don't book your order in zomato.",1
Abo ut the restaurant no spoons and no 🥣 in the food After I have called also for them,1
I wish I can give 0 stars to them. I order from kfc with the help of Zomato and they time that was reflecting was around 30 -45mins and I have to leave for my flight within 1 hour. But order took1 hour 35 mins reach I left hungry food waste I asked for refund in my bank they rejected it and gave me coupon of ₹374 of same price of my order. When I tried to redeem it they told my you order food for ₹150 bucks and you can't re use that are fraud they ate my chicken and refund me less swigy is bet,1
This app is actually fraud... Their riders call and tell people to cancel orders according to their own comfort and give false assurance to pay back prepaid money but on cancellation of order they deduct all money as cancellation penalty charges... So unfair and illogical... Worst experience ever No redressal No proper person to call and seek solution Running fraud,1
"The app has offers but it is not valid in our city.They took extra charges for delivery but did not deliver the item in time and for this compassion also not available.All discount offer is not useful like first 5 order, 30% etc.i complained about this through mail but as usual no reply.WORST APP AND SERVICE EVER I SEEN.",1
Horrible experience...i placed order and due to some urgency could not pick call bloody hell they cancelled by prepaid order and refused to hive refund as well..i called bot for refund but to ask why the hell u cancelled my order..I wanted order to be delivered not even refund but if you are not delivering order atleast give refunds...What is yhe point of giving exact address if your riders cant understand that and deliever without calling..yiu people sucks,1
horrible app... menus are not correct... and when we place order and get wring deliveries the customer support is snobby... they are nt helpful at all... they tlk rude.. i got two wrong orders and when i tried to explain to the support that some of these items I am allergic to and cant eat.. they said they cant help since the food is already delivered.. why pay for something i cant eat.. they didn't refund the amount.. they put up wrong menus.. total fail app.. swiggy is 1000 times better,1
"The app is really good.. It deserves 4-5 stars.. But i rated it less due to it's last update.. They don't display the zomato eazy offers anymore, which obviously is one of the factors which not only i but most of the people like about it.. Bring that back, it was convenient and useful.. That was the fact that made me love zomato in the first place..",3
Im uninstalling this app untill u are hire kamraj back. #supportzomatoboy #supportkamraj,1
im using this app only when im bored to kitchen.. not provide good services by delivery boys.. and there attitude was so rude.. and they delivered food after 30-40 minutes and food was totally cold.. 🤮.. im not suggested for hot and tempting food... discounts are good but not meaningfull against cold food..otherwise hotels list and menus are good..,2
This app is not running a properly because address was not detected ....and app detected automatically other address...and than call to customer care they are ....not accept problem....and if we order cancelled than they will not give you amount....and say that this is penalty.....,1
You are not sure what and how prepared food customer is getting. Taste is not at all. Its better to be hungry than online food. Very sorry but you eat and see the food the select respective restaurant. Just delivery is outdated concept. Take money fir assurance not delivery. Delivery is job assurance is responsibility. Regards.,1
"i usally ordr food from different restaurants and many a times i get bad food.. i cant do anything for those restaurants sending bad food.. but i have a suggestion.. The section where u ask us to rate the food.. if a user gives some 2 or 3 stars provide them few options that helps him to clarify as to why he rated it low.. fr example in case of resraurant.. ""poor quality"" ; ""packaging"";""quantity"", etc.. and its ur guys' responsibility to forward those feedbacks to restaur so they can improve.",4
"the experience is better. i had some issues with my order, but amazing customer service. the agent assigned was very helpful and took my matter seriously. happy with their service.",3
Had not just one but quite a few terrible experiences with the zomato delivery. the response of the Zomato support was substandard. the delivery guys hired are completely inexperienced about the usage of the app and delivery itself! the entire experience has been nothing but unpleasant.,1
"After the Uber Eats and Zomato merger, there are absolutely no restaurants showing up on Zomato. None of the restaurants that were available on Uber Eats are available on Zomato. Utterly disappointing. Instead of expanding their reach, they have effectively shrunk down their presence. Wow!",1
This is my first ever review followed bt the reasons. Automated tips and delivery boys not delivering the food and sometimes sharing the meal without your knowledge. Really creepy plus professional. You spend so much on advertising and marketing. But you guys fail to keep your valuable customers satisfied. Really disappointed and annoyed.,1
Promo code shown has applied but after placing the order i have charged for full amount... I have explained the issue in vhat service but they are responding like bots and requesting me to email after almost 1 hour of chat...i shouldn't rate 1 as i can't rate it as zero star...worst experience,1
This is surprising and unprofessional that despite of developing such a great platform Zomato customer service is so poor and no customer friendly. This I am writing after many rounds of interactions with customer service team over a period of last couple of years... None of the time this team was helpful whenever required. Senior Management is advised to look into this as customer satisfaction should be one of the important agenda apart from earning revenues.,2
Quick and easy. Only issue i have is when i open a restaurant i cant view the address of the restaurant immediately. Once the order is placed the location is visible.,5
"As i read many reviews i find Zamato need to work on there service quality, i faced some issue the quality food which i ordered was v poor so i try to contact the Zomato customer care but in the name of help ,there is only deaf and dump app option, where we get automated reply ,no use of that , u feel cheated at that point Another thing if u want to rate that restaurant n want to share feedback there is no option for the same,",2
"Non veg items in veg food orders, hair particle, insects, and other foreign particles are easily available every now and then and worst service experience I have ever experienced in resolving the issue. Especially in COVID-19 situation, don't prefer to order from Zomato at least.",1
everytime I place order from them something is not delivered in order or I get a stale food. when complained they send automated response this was not our intention would not happen again. Always my money spent on Zomato is wasted. 0 out of 100 on all aspects.,1
"Atleast 20% of time they fail to deliver food. When you contact them, all they do is refund amount; you get your money back in 7 days & get the added bonus of going to sleep hungry. On every weekends/holidays they impose this 'Surge fees' on delivery saying there's high demand, like no s*** sherlock people are at home & going to order, why the b***** f*** can't you hire more delivery boys like Swiggy & others do? Bottom line, save 90mb net along with peace of mind & don't download this app.",1
This is a horrible and absolutely hopeless app. We waited for 2 hrs and then he asked us if he should bring the food!! We called 12 times but he did not respond. Horrible service yet the app said that the food has been delivered. Do not ever order from this app.,1
"Recently their customer support quality has become non existent. I had a food delivery delay of over one hour from the promised 45mins, total of 2+ hours. Restaurant issued a refund and told me to claim it from Zomato chat. The bot was useless and they were busy, next day I was told it was too late! Then i was told the restaurant declined the refund, which they denied. Its been 3 weeks and all zomato did was apologise and do nothing without bothering to even look into the matter.",1
"Zomato is operating considerably good in India considering the kind of people they have to operate with including the customers as well as the food delivery people. Even after these challenges, I evaluate Zomato to be doing pretty good. They should however, expand their presence on other parts of Indian geography and also take some good measures to keep their delivery executive behaviour and performance in check.",4
Very poor customer service.The order can be cancelled by delivery person and if the customer has paid for the order he will loose his/her money. There is no use in contacting customer care or sending emails to customer support.They will raise a ticket# but wont respond there after. Try uber eats or swiggy they are much better.,1
Emailed n number of times and did chat n number of times but no response. Didn't expect this from ZOMATO. Swiggy is much faster. Regarding delivery at my place which hardly 2kms from ur delivery point. But Swiggy is delivering. But not my from favourite restaurant. Even today I paid Rs.20 extra for delving. Not good.....,1
Expensive food. If you look at the original restaurant menu the food is slightly cheaper what it is listed on Zomato. On top of that they charge you taxes and to be honest I'm fine with delivery charges .,2
"It's simply horrible. Ordered food at 8.00 pm and till 2.00 am, it's showing your food is being prepared. Your food will be delivered by 27 min and sometimes it's showing by 28 min. That's all ...... and after this review I am happily uninstalling the scary app.",1
Good service compared to others,4
"app is good , new offers keep the customers attracted. But as far as food is concerned, last time my food was not warm. first time i have been experiencing such a case.",3
"Had a very bad experience with the customer support. They are not at all in a place of helping Customers for queries also Issues with the Application I mean automatic picking location was horrible. Lastly, they blame customers that we didn't write exact location.",1
"Zomato service is totally bad. If we received any problem related then i don't have any solution. No call ,no chat help ,only mail. But if any query related order then where we ask? .no solution. Then they tell mail to zomato. But instant query where we ask??.",1
"Worst support and quality services. I ordered for butter chicken and the delivered was worst. It is not butter chicken. And even when i contact support they do not have phone support. And support agent told me that they have quality services. Quality service my foot. Support agent do not have knowledge to how to treat customers. If there is option for negative feedback, i will surely. Poor services by zomato",1
Very bad service. My sister ordered pizza from dominos through zomato on 31st night. Pay online. Orderd not delivered that day. Till we are facing to get money back. Swiggy is far better than zomato even customer support also good. They are very kuch professional than zomato customer support.,1
Too many technical issues with the app. It seems like no quality control is made. And the info on delivery time is incorrect and they consider it acceptable to expect a delivery that will be 15 minutes late,2
Do not trust Zomato. They dont make sure proper delivery of food. I have been using this for more than 3 yrs and have had worst and embarrassing moments recently. They had sent me wrong orders 4 times and they just say that their policies have been updated and no refunds. Once they became a market leader their attitude towards customer relationship has changed. Very worst attitude.,1
Completely pathetic delivery service by Zomato...,1
Very very poor service,1
"The management team is very irresponsible. If you apply for a prorated refund of your Gold membership because THEY have changed the terms and conditions, you will not receive it. The team will not reply any time soon and keep stalling the process till you get tired of following up with them. Its been a month since I asked for mine and Im still waiting. Would not recommend buying Gold membership.",1
Loving the new update in the application. Amazing design. I use zomato so much because of the UI and speed. Food services can be improved but that depends on the restaurant and delivery people. All in all great app,5
"Such a bad experience after using uber eats.. almost all the time most of the good places are ""closed for ordering"". It seems they have reduced the radius area covered also.. Keep it up and soon some new app will come and overtake Zomato.",1
"The previous interfaces of the app was more user friendly then this update. #Lost option of Paytm wallet Their is problem while using PAYTM It showing zero balance and when I tried options Paytm UPI the only option it's showing is of my bank , not show the option of *Paytm wallet* Please try to fix this problem as soon as possible.",2
"Wrong food delivery, no live support. Restaurant blames zomato, they blame restaurant. Chat bot says the issue will be solved in 24 to 48 hours. So till then I have to stay hungry even though I have paid in full. This is not only in India. I have faced similar issues in UAE. No customer support at all.",1
"The offers are quite competitive. But the downfall of them is on the delivery. Everytime I order via App, there has always been delays on time of delivery which make you feel frustrated at times.",2
"Customer service is terrible. No remorse at all and takes too long to respond. Waited for an order 1 hour and 30min even though it was finished already because Zomato had activated a promo that shouldn't have been running and made me, the customer, pay for the fees.",1
"very poor customer service. highly disappointing. pls never try reordering incase your phone hangs or app stops responding as they will make it a duplicate order and charge you for what you haven't even ordered. this review cant be posted without a star, else it should get a big zero. useless app",1
Worst app. No customer value. Uneducated people are hired they even don't know how to talk and treat the customer. No customer support number. Chat support never work. Trying to contact them but able to from 2 days. If i would have have option to rate lower than 1 i would have seriously done it.,1
"worst food app., i placed an order without applying promo code by mistake and immediately went to cancel it and this app is saying that food is cooked and it will be wasted etc etc as I only took 5 seconds to cancel it and on my next order they included the price of food which I cancelled before and you got no choice but to pay that Bill also.. literally pathetic management",1
"Robotic replies not giving you the option of describing your actual problems. I once paid using my card and food never arrived as the restaurant was closed (did zomato feel the need to tell me? apparently not) - needless to say, never got my credit back even after following up with zomato more than once.",1
worst app for online delivery of foods. not even a single delivery has been delivered in due time. The delivery boy doesn't pick up the phone and always carry 2-3 orders at a time. Very bad experience.,1
Price of most of the restaurants are really high but you can definitely find out the restaurants of your budget. They've huge list of restaurants near you. So overall I enjoy using zomato. Their food representation is really good.,4
Delivery time is pathetic. My delivery was combined with another customer's. Just because the customer who had ordered before me had made mistake they were trying to rectify his problem. In the process delivery for me was getting delayed. I had ordered rotis from Swiggy and they got delivered in 14 mins. I had ordered subji from Zomato and they got delivered after 1 hr 15 mins. Imagine an hour's difference. It was extremely embarrassing in front of guests who were made to wait. So unpleasant...,1
"No option to give 0 stars. Horrible customer support. Have inflated zomato gold fees and no support for gold members. No customer care number..noone is replying on chat. Im left embarrassed at the restaurant because the restaurant didnt specify the correct name and I'm unable to use gold. Just the most annoying experience ever, zomato has been completely unresponsive!!",1
"Very poor customer resolving and retention. There has been n number of instances and everytime the so called zomato customer service team compels me to uninstall and quit zomato for life. Feels helpless when I have come on the app. Very very poor customer service, no value for the customers money.",1
let me tell u how this app works ur gonna find good discounts on food but with a little degraded quality nd if by mistake u booked an order for suppose of ₹300 then it will be charged on the next order with no mercy on the charging rates.so i asked them if the food was going to be dumped feed it to a poor being.and the reply was the food will be utilised by the restaurant itself.this means ur charging us for the whole food which is gonna be reused by the restaurant itself! this is no humanity...,1
Very poor service....facing many issues reagarding my orders...and the good thing is that zomato people said that they have no customer care number...so nobody can contact with them ...they are free to do anything what they want....very good policy...so tell us that where we can register our complain...who is responsibe person to solve our issues...,1
Worst aap for food delivery.. I ordered my pizza through this but after that they cancelled my order and said.. Very soon you will get your money now it's 35+ days and I'm still waiting for my refund... Even I have complained so many times but they didn't reply me correctly.,1
"Don't order here if you are hungry, they will not deliver on time, and never go by the estimated time shown before payment, once you pay its at the discretion of the restaurant at what time he can deliver and Zomato has no control on it, I did take my lesson the difficult way, hope you make a better one",1
"every time i want to order, app shows ""the restaurant is not accepting orders at this time"". and no restaurant becomes available... while on the website only one restaurant is shown in the list in my area 15 times...",1
"If logging with different numbers from same phone is fraudulent or suspicious, then it's better to order food from other apps.👎 And you won't get a refund even if the food is so bad that even dogs reject it.",1
I had good experience with Zomato. I request to include book for option in this app. Which might help to mention their phone. Coz sometimes we may book food from outstation for the member in home so that it can help the delivery boy to reach person in home..,4
The (burger king) restaurants never send complete orders. All that Zomato does is return credits that gets reflected in the account after 7 days. There's a lot of opportunity cost missed in these 7 days !!! Bad bad platform. Swiggy is so much better.,1
"Worest application really, they will give the offers but food will be low quality and quantity with the poor taste but if we go to the same restaurant or order in another application it will be tasty and quality food. It's to bad business.",1
Second instance of food not being delivered. After the order is done and payment made they call and tell you that it does not belong to their area so they are cancelling the order. Then the blame game and transfers start. Even customer care is not helpful.,1
"Hi i did order from dominoz through zomato. Dominoz was showing one garlic breadstick free with order but they did not place the order. They are not picking my phone as well. If lockdown happen, it does not mean dominoz loot the customer. They should have to contact the customer. Cheese burst pizza was not same as it was before. V less cheese is there . Very bad experience with dominoz now and before this. One time dominoz forget to send coke with order and now breadsticks.",1
Worst support team i have seen in any application. I had problem regarding promo code which the chat support guys did not solve. They just ask you to write an email every time you get a problem(which they know many won't do and just ignore the concern).Really disappointed with the services.,1
Everything was fine until the transaction and order was cancelled after the completion of online payment. No refund notification nor any response from customer care even after reporting the issue. Don't consider reliable anymore.,1
"I like to order from Jomato, it is working very well updated thank you team and zomato.",5
Very bad application worst if i could say delay food deliveries No support from executives Delivery person's are mostly Rude No refund of money if your food is not delivered in time or sometime it is not delivered also I want to give zero stars but sadly we don't have that option . I have deleted this application,1
Very bad app. Amount deducted two times but shows payment failed and after 30 minutes both order get placed. Also I didn't get refund. Also there isn't any reachable customer care service. Customer care service is pathetic.,1
Excellent experience 😉.... Serves like God .... Foodies inde kaval maalakha 🧚....,5
the taser of food delivery offers are good. the reason why I gave 3 stars is some times i am getting invalid promo when it was valid. ex: I ordered I item and after I want to order other by using first 5 new user offer but I does not getting it. I had left 1 new user offer. not only this other promos are also showing not valid.,3
Very unfriendly policies for the users. I placed an order by mistake where i forgot to apply the promo code. i contacted zomato immediately to cancel the order but got no help. very poor experience. wont be using zomato anymore as many better alternatives exist.,1
Fast service it is a very good app,5
"WORST!!! WHILE FACING AN ISSUE ONLY GET TO KNOW HOW WORST IS ZOMATO, ORDER AN ITEM FROM 2 HRS, NEITHER THE RESTAURANT NOR THE DELIVERY BOY TAKE Responsibility, Restaurant says order picked up some one, no proof of the delivery boy, delivery boy says I didn't ick up, No customer support from zomato, some automated system generated messages are there customer support, I lost my money, some unprofessional staffs of zomato had my food.... Will uninstall the aap today itself... No more use of zomato",1
"No control over the restaurants and valets. Orders are accepted, valets are sending delivered message before delivering to meet service standards. Zomato washes hands off these issues. When you call the restaurant they ask you to contact zomato customer care and vice versa. Service will go down eventually. Too many competitors.",1
"With a view to all feedback of users I observed every feedback has a same answer ' write on us XYZ mail ' but according to me feedback is the more important part of the customer service and should be as short & quick as possible so, can be get more transparency from user end but here you suggest one more time describe us the same on your official id So, user will be appreciate your response against query if the same would be resolve quickly on single platform (here)",2
"Horrible, been waiting for 20 mins for chat support as my account was debited and in the app shows as failed, I couldn't order food nor my amount is credited back and there is no response from the support team, absolutely unprofessional.",1
best app to order food online. their chat support system is awesome and they give great discounts as well. i love it. other apps are nothing in comparison to this. keep up the great work!!,5
2 star for good delivery on time. but this app not cancellation policy in any order and they are not give 5 second to cancel your order. if you order by mistake than you isn't cancel. and full amount adjustment with your next order..,2
They cancel order from themselve and doesnot give refund.worst service ever Worst app... Today also have played the order and they got the amount but in app it is showing incomplete,1
"Pathetic, specially the Gold plan is so useless. It often delivers late and then add promo as compensation and later fails to deliver the same. Ultimately the customer gets nothing. And the customer service is very slow. Better switch to others",1
"Delivery startegy sucks! After picking up my order, guy goes to different restraunt which further away and my delivery time keeps increasing. The sucking part is that chat support who doesn't have an explanation for this except to say it will be delivered in a century",1
Extremly bad app... Unhappy... This is my final order if i didn't get any response on this its making fool people by giving add by saying offers but while applying it while placing order then it's saying invalid offer. how come offer applied sucessfully 1 min before but just modifying before final payment then after it's not applying. very slow app it stucking in between also it takes me 45 mins to place one order with all plan menu item with hotels . i would suggest better to go for other apps.,1
worst customer support(or no customer support ).. due to rains restaurant said they cant deliver.. which is fair enough and i am fine with it but they should refund my payment.. to get the payment back was the real challenge(yet to receive refund at the time of writing review).. there is no way to call zomato.. the chat window just throws up random waiting time which never ends..,2
The customer service chat is very disappointing. No one comes at the other end to liaten to you. There is no customer service helpline number also. I have been trying to reach out since last 2 days for an issue but in vain.,1
"Only positive point is that I get the food delivery at home. Otherwise, all the items are sold at rates 20-30% higher than the actual restaurant parcel rates even after offered discounts.",2
seriously i rated it 5 star without knowing the fact that the price they show in their app is way too high than the price actually charges by restraunts and even thiugt they add deliver charges with the good example order is 150 but when i checked it by calling shop the price was 120 and they added 30 ruppes delivery charges extra now price reached to 180 so guys please don't orded from ZOMATO its a really a nabbing people pleaseeeeeeeeeee DON'T DOWNLOAD IT AND ASLO RECOMMEND YOUR FRIEND ALSO,1
"Can you add an new tab for newly restaurants linked to ZOMATO and food ordering can be done (do add date as of when the restaurant you got it joined and more over keep recent list date of restaurant, now a days we cant find a proper restaurant, and also give an request option so customers can ask which restaurant they liked and to be joined so you can join them by this customer suport and experience will be more improved",1
Very bad custumer care service now.I uninstalled the app after using it for 3 years.No effective resolution of the problems.one item was missing from my order and customer care tells that they will give feedback to restaurant about issue.No genuine action was taken to resolve the issue or to credit money back.The customer care response is limited to very few automated messages and no furthur action.you will be left with no other option rather than losing the money.,1
I like the delivery options and like tracking. Would prefer filters to select veg only restaurants at the onset. The zomato gold membership should be expanded to my favorite restaurants.. All of them are getting away by the day.,5
"this is my experience with Zomato, i will order very frequently in one restaurant , unfortunately one day i went that restaurant and i saw the rate and quality diffrence, then i got to know nearly for every order i am paying more than Rs.60 out of 200 order value. in this worrest thing is that value after 40%",2
"I would like to rate them 5 star but after few weird incidents, I thought of giving this rating. I would not recommend this app to anyone they have policies supporting hotels , they never considering the user. If you contact them for any support they will say like our policies won't work that way and they wont reveal their policies anywhere. Really disappointed with their support.Adding few more comments based on response, I already told above I contacted support and they said we are helpless",1
Sevice is very bad. Thier resturant partner delivered wrong item and charged heavily without mentioning the proper description of the quantity of the product. And if you complain about that they told you that we provide only this much which is much lesser than the quantity we usually get in the resturant for that price point in the same resturant when go for fine dine.,1
Good service executives and polite,5
"Best food delivery app as well as the restaurant booking, finder app.. all in one for a foodie in you.! Now they've come up with piggy bank offer which is really good. U get some minimum discount on each order..!",4
I have ordered from one of their restaurant i paid from google pay it was successfuly paid and the money was deducted from my account but they showed that it wasn't succceesful and thus my order was not placed. My money and time both was wasted. I sent then an email too addressing the same issue but they didn't responded to it even I tried calling their number but no answer. I tried to contact them through app but again nothing happened. Worst experience.,1
"Worst app ever.. It will show you all the restaurants open and once you've done with the transaction, they will tell that the restaurant is closed... Not that I'm concerned about my refund, but, I'M STARVING....",1
"What's up with the new damn update zomato? You removed the last 5 orders rating for restaurants.On ordering menu,there is no longer horizontal menu categories which makes navigating through menu frustrating. And the new layout is bad,why copying ubereats and swiggy ui design?",1
"Worst food delivery app. Received spilled packaging twice in a day. Moreover the chat support is not bothered at all. After waiting for 33 mins they are still not replying. And then suddenly they send a message ""Hope your issue is resolved by now.Bye"" . What the hell.. Such low level of service is not at all expected from Zomato.",1
"Very bad experience. They give multiple orders to a single valet due to which the food gets cold and the order gets delayed.. customer satisfaction has become the last priority for Zomato. Never ever order any food such as shakes, juices, Naans, etc. Because it will be spoilt totally before it reaches you and there is no way one can complain about it to Zomato.",4
"No problem with apps operations, but overall experience with service is very poor. Partner restaurants don't provide secure packaging but take charges for it. Happened with me. and in reply they shows only apology. Not recommended app at all..",1
A very reliable and convenient application. Zomato has really facilitated the delivery of food at our homes plus one gets the correct and appropriate reviews of the restaurants. It is like a shopping mall for foodies.,5
"Damed stop pushing your Zomato Gold Ad, I am fed up. I don't want it, many others don't want it. 5 stars to 1 star for excessive bugging, I don't feel like opening the app also as Everytime you open it you get the ad and it's been months and months. Old review - Love it, but I owe a lot of extra weight gained to it.",1
Worst app increased service charges but removed chat option from app. Many times the food is worst quality. If we need to raise any issue simply tell them to send a mail to some service mail. Swiggy is very very good and better in service and food also.yoi guys need to learn many trips from swiggy.. I love swiggy deliveries if,1
The app should provide support feature to contact customer care for immediate assistance. Zomato chat doesn't work and has limited automated options that do not serve the purpose. There is no contact number for customer support. Payment gateway keeps defaulting.,2
"I am not at all suggest this app for others this is not a first time when i book my order with proper location address it has take another address with 11 kilometres different my location regarding this issue I called customer care they are not serving properly they are very rudely talking,i was pay money for total order 334 rupees he said that we are not delivery in your address we will cancel your order and money also not refunded, I am very un satisfied and just uninstalled the app.",1
Extremely unsatisfactory. The riders are rude and cancel orders and we are supposed to pay the penalty for orders we haven't canceled. The order is messed up most of the times. Hate this app. Never comes on time if they deliver at all.,1
Worst app in food delivery. even they don't have any concern on customer queries they simply blindly follow the delivery boys words. my order was cancelled by you guys because my mobile not reachable when the time of delivery but it is a false statement made by the delivery boy. and you guys not ready to know this is true or not.this is the way you are getting profits from customers. plz don't install this app guys.,1
"Worst app ever, they have took my whole amount of money as cancellation charges, atleast they might have initiate some refund, orelse deliver the food. But when requested to them , they only replied that it is as per their cancellation policies.. 😡😡😡😡",1
Their service sucks literally. My dinner order was delayed for about 1 hour and got cancelled after making me wait for 1 hour. They should have informed about the issue without such a long time delay. They are delayed and impolite responders too.,1
They send egg patties instead of paneer patties.....how cheap you guys are,1
They have very much unfair rules regarding customer service.their policy is just to loot customer in the name of policy. Don't have any costomer voice support or any escalation channel.No option to revisit or re consider option to customer.once u hit that place order button you lost the game and the ball is now in their basket.,1
"worst support from Zomato. i have ordered Dominoz pizza from zomato with online payment. But the dominoz said that the payment not received and i have to pay again. there is no contact number for zomato, there is waiting tine for chat and no response on chat. i lost half an hour to contact, finally i paid the dominoz again, meantime pizza got cold and the mood is ruined. never order from Zomato. Same experience with my friend.",1
worst app ever...they don't even give their customer cares number so if you have any issue you will just have to chat and in reply you will receive prewritten msgs.so please think before ordering your food as they dont give any refund for cancellation even if its not you fault in cancellation of order.,1
"I have mistakenly selected wrong adress you guys didn't give option to change the address, I have cancelled the order and charged 75 rupees within 8 min of placing the order, you guys better have to BEG infront any street, if you guys charge this much. I have also placed the same order with same restaurant but different address. But you guys didn't give a full refund. SHAME ON YOU ZOMATO. this is my last order with you.",1
Bad service. Money was debited due to your server issue but the cutomer care of zomato was constantly aaking me to contact bank and We cant to anything. Also Charge for one item was 30% more than the actual price. Agree you have to run a merchandise but atleast show us why and where you are charging us extra.,1
App works fine and service is good. But servers get effed up and all restaurants go offline sometimes.. Service is decent at my place but I really wish they mandate people who bring orders not to beg for 5 star ratings. Let me eat 1st then I will rate.,4
nice app very usefull the problem comes when hotel doesnt accept order for longer duration they call and tell that they cannot send food. instead if they send food from another restaurant it will be helpfull. i faced this issue twice.,4
"Hotels and Restaurants are good but the delivery after 10 is like: Every delivery person cancels after 10 PM. And we get to know that after 30-40 mins that because of delivery person's non-availability, Hotels & Restaurants cancels the order.",3
"Service is getting poor day by day. 1) Very high delivery and other charges. 2) Delay in delivery. One delivery boy is delivering multiple orders in single time. 3) They will never give u refund ,if u r not satisfied with order.",1
"Zomato support doesn't work and if their is an update, im unable to update, i have something as Peggy's balance which isnt reflecting on my app, zomato support is my major concern , it hasnt been working ea very long time But when i check on past store app it doesn't show any tab as update Only shows, uninstall and open",1
"the full menu options arent all available. I dont mean ice cream either. I mean I can go to other service and gave full items and go to zomato and have half the options. however, I do think the opportunity to save money with zomato is better because offer coupons i can actually use. i appreciate that.",4
"Its a real time saver and efficient food dilevry app. The best part is that we all at a certain point have difficulties technical or non delivery of orders. They do care and take immediate action ,thats what make me order from them.",5
I wanted to cancel this order and reorder again as my friend came to my place. But no cancelation option. Zomato customer care called me and said next time when you order the cancelation amount will be deducted. Again Food vendor confirmed that they canceled my order but again sent food to my door steps. I will not use zomato and my friends also. M uninstalling app and never use zomato again in future.,1
The app is very buggy and always shows different prices for different users. I get charged a higher tax than my friend. I sent this issue through customer support and reveived no response. Would not recommend.,1
"I have ordered dinner comprising 2 items of chicken, i.e. Chilly chicken & Chicken garlic ( each item, 6 pieces of chicken in it as told by Theque). But after the delivery boy left, I found that the food containers are not sealed and only 4 pieces of chicken inside each chicken items. I immediately contacted Theque, but they told me, they had sent each chicken items with 6 pieces each in sealed container! It was my first order through Zomato! I request you to compensate me.",1
"its nice but the problem is it does not allow you to order from different restaurants at once. also it doesn't show the picture of many food items, which makes it tough to try out something new!",5
"I am having really bad experience with zomato. Item prices displaying one while order and when placed order it changed, when discussed with support chat they are not ready to help even they don't have customer support number. Instead of helping me they are giving excuses. Its really bad.",1
You assign delivery orders to valets which are far away from the restaurant thereby increasing the customer wait time. The food becomes cold after being prepared at the restaurant. You have a very small chat support team which is handling multiple chats at same time thereby increasing the response time. Very pathetic experience twice in a week,1
"Thank you saviours, but my complain is to be little smart...I got Zomato Gold for 6months of time, by the time I could realize that I have offer and could redeem my offer is gone..Zomato should have basic computer logic to chk start and enroll time what is the point of such offers which ppl couldn't use but you boost for it.",5
Excellent app interface for the food to view and some very good discounts.,4
The delivery is not at all good.. they deliver wrong food item and then they don't consider the complain also. The restaurant says they are not responsible if you place order through zomato and zomato customer care are worst. They say the order is delivered. There is no customer care number and on chat they won't listen. Worst experience,1
"Neat and informative, with facility to customize most orders. Also, very important, zero ad annoyance to voice out. One criticism is how difficult it got to get any info (menus, phone numbers, directions,...) on eateries anywhere else on the web. The monopoly is uncool 👀",4
"Awesome service, however need to improve on saying ""This restaurant does not deliver at your location"" . Unable to understand the reason for this, since delivery is done by you...not by the restaurants",4
"As a first time user of zomato, had terrible experience and would never use it again or recommand to anyone, cannot call customer support/text/or even delivery executives For a very long time food i orderd were still not given to delivery executive from hotels side as per your tracking is showing and cannot call or contact anyone or enquire on the same This will be my first and last experience with zomato and as i will be forced to stick to depend on my usual apps for delivery were never have i faced any issue like this all these years",2
The policies are absolutely ridiculous.. I wanted to change my payment method from paytm to cod. the app didn't even ask me first it..I cancelled the order for changing my payment method and 100% of my order price was taken as penalty... Not recommended for new users,1
It's okay but this is not cool that we can't get refund 😣 even when the food quality is not good or if the restaurant don't follow our cooking instructions .... Then why you ask us to give instructions when they not gonna follow that ....some people have allergies to some specific thing ....this is really bad .....,3
"This is the second time the delivery person has either not delivered the order or has brought partial order. This time I asked him to go back and get the missing order, it has been 30 mins since and he has not yet returned. Note is he picking the phone. Very annoying...",1
"What i have noticed is that, price rates have increased in the form of zomato charges (delivery included) and the food quantity has decreased significantly. And this change has taken place in like, 1 to 1 and half years itself.",3
"Overall great app for ordering food. I have suscribed for zomato gold and 2+2 offer is amazing where we get 2 complimentry drinks on first 2 drinks, plus on zomato gold some restaurant offer free second highest dish free like if you order dish ""A"" of price 300 and you have ordered dish ""B"" of 250 then you get dish ""B"" for free.....",5
"Easy to food. It's very nice of zomato to let us enjoy 50% off, and so I often hook myself up to lassi, Rs. 40 thing comes up to be charged a modest Rs. 20 and hurrah!!!!!, 40 mins more to savour a bite. Really loving it, with ordering on my smartphone, in Varanasi.",5
"Worst customer support. If we raise a concern in chat , they ask us to drop an email . If we drop an email with all the screenshots. They say it will not happen again. What's the point of dropping an email then .. complete waste of.time and effort.",1
Going to uninstall as service keep decreasing day by day. Order few items from popular sweet shop. One was incorrectly updated. Second and main item not delivered. But still you are charging delivery fee?? Earlier services was good but now it's totally pathetic.,1
I faced the problem with address issue. Already mentioned default address to deliver. But the app taking wrong address while placing orders and supporting team declining the orders by mentioning as not available to take delivery... Thank you for the support Zomato....,2
Very worst service.. Customer Support service also not good. They can take 1.15hrs fr deliver the food. My food prepared on 9.53 PM but its delivered on 11.10 PM. Customer support didnt reply my chats !! My Kind advice Use anyother Food delivery app. Nowadays Zomato doesnt care their customers.,1
"Completely disliking the app! I have been complaining since ages that my card is not being accepted on Zomato, I have send screenshots over email couple of times yet no response. I miss out on promotions because of a glitch in the app which no one is bothered to rectify it. I wouldn't even prefer to give the app 1 star!",1
"I ordered meal from McDonald worth Rs. 500 and they delivered that in Paper bag( and i supported that too, thats not the main issue) when i got the order it was wet from bottom may be due to likage of coke and due to which my whole order fell on the ground. I dont know whom to blame, McD or Delivery person. And when i did the complaint through chat (because they dont provide calling option) they're telling me it will take 24 hrs for someone to call me. Wow, great service.",1
you need to do something about you app glitches especially during weekend. Chat support literally sucks !! you guys take gold subscriptions but don't have the service upto that level... i am sure you guys are way behind in terms of the service you provide.,2
Worst service. Taking much more time than expected. The delivery person is some where and he is roaming other places. They even calling me that there are in the currentvlocation but he was at 7 mins distance. Actually the ordered place is only 3 mins from my home but they took 64 mins to deliver,1
I ordered my food last night around 2.30am and I paid for it but I did not get my order. 1st of the year I had to go to bed without eating. And my money is also gone. And there is No response from Zomato. Very very very poor customer service and Customer Satisfaction,1
"yes, there delivery speed is good and they are delivering within half an hour but, you have to improve the feedback system because, i ordered 2 times and the hotel reviews was good but the food wasn't, so please take care of the review system. how can a hotel get good feedback when there food is terrible",2
Their chat for support is horrible just templates are shown and i couldn't discuss my issue and I am unsure if my refund is being processed. I did a upi payment but my account is debited and the order shows its not completed. And nobody is on the support to help me with this.,1
Worst experience ever ....i have order momos approx at 9 pm today and it still shows your food is being prepared ..and when i try to contact customer care it provide only chat support which only responds please wait untill your wallet is assigned ..and it takes almost 3 hours and still counting ..,1
"it has turned into one of the worst app in last few days... coupons cant be applied, payment cant be done . Every now and then i am getting an error occurred. Refresh and try again but the problem remains same ...",1
Waste customer service. Plz do not go to order in online. They never refund you at all.,1
they dont update the availability of items. after i wait for my order for half an hour they call me up just to say the item is out of stock. this has happened multiple times. infact this happens consecutively on some days.,1
i am rating after using for a year continuosly and trust me it is the best app for food delivery and dining out...and customer services are also very helpful. thank you for creating such a fantastic app. i love it!!!,5
Zomato needs to cross check the original prices with their partners. The zomato menu has higher prices when compared with original restraunt prices. This doesn't include the packing and delivery. Just the prices of only the food.,1
THE WORST EXPERIENCE OF ANY FOOD DELIVERY APP. It is my great misfortune that I happen to use this worthless app. Only use it if you have like 4-5 hrs to waste as the app will show restaurants which are not available and then when you will die of hunger or have guests waiting then it will tell you that your order cant be accepted.,1
"Poor app management and customer care service If we placed an order by mistake there is no option to cancel it and there is no customer care reachable numbers we can contact to cancel it and the customer care service chat in this app simply says ""we cannot cancel the order"" this is utter nonsense. There are many chances in which human error may happen and an order might be placed wrong. i am totally not pleased with this kind of customer service",1
In an instant all the restaurants are closed and after some time they all open at once in an instant and this goes in a cycle. This is happening since the service started in our area Jhalawar- Rajasthan about a month back. I can't even order my things.,1
Unable to apply coupon,1
I've only left 3 stars so far because this is my first order. I'm from the uk and not used this type of app before and so I've been a bit held back to use it. The order process has been very easy to follow from restaurant decision through to payment. I'll add or remove stars when the order is delivered.,3
"man, pissed off trying to order food through app... every step was taking a lot of time....at last online payment option crashed 5 times and that too took a lot of my time...orderd food selecting COD and requested valet to take online payment.... why should i contact you on the first place, am i your employee to work to improve you, either dont reply at all or if you do be responsible....",1
"Please never use this app you have to regret it they will take your money and time, you would trash out of it, if you order strictly veg meal they will definitely send you something in non veg and you won't be able to have it over that they will not accept their mistake and will not refund the money.",1
"Overall a good app with great offers. But only thing to make it better is their policy on wrong delivery, late delivery. They should provide correct order if some mistake took place instead of giving that zomato credits which are useless if someone is hungry and waiting for his/her food.",3
"A useless app and with no sense of how to use logistics, 30 mins after ordering food, they cancel the order citing technical reasons that the rider/delivery boy is on a cycle and won't be able to deliver the order. Worst experience ever with an app",1
Felt like being robbed. Inflated prices shown in App. In reality prices are much less. Even if you take extra delivery charges into consideration still the prices are inflated for a majority of food items.,1
Placed an order and delivery status showed 15 mins almost for more than an hour hence contacted the customer care. They connected to the concerned delivery person but he said he didn't receive any order. Contacted the zonal manager who did not answer nor did he bothered to call back. Contacted restaurant and they confirmed that order was ready but no one from zomato showed up. Contacted chat support and after explaining everything he informed order is canceled after 1+ hour of follow up😠😠,1
They even don't have customers care number and the ad given of on time or free they are not giving as order delayed and chat with customers care so much time around 30 min they give coupons which not applicable to so many restaurants I request not use this app as they are deciving public with add of on time or free and no customer care number. I think it get to notice consumer court they only they stop this deciving people,1
"It has an impressive search engine but it keeps on insisting that I pay by card, which I find highly irritating. Whichever restaurant and whichever amount I want to pay by cash it says it can only accept the amount by card. Thankfully their are other apps like Swiggy that don't impose these rediculous restrictions.",1
Worst experience They don't have value of costomers concern. Delivery persons are fraud and they steal food of prepaid order and after so many complaint no one give positive reply to customers. We ordered food because we were hungry and we came from trip and and we despirately wait for above 2-3 hours and what we get fraud. And no one is listening us and eve they don't have customer care or helpline numbers...,1
"Pathetic customer service, no mechanism to contact zomato. They will not allow to cancel order in case if your order doesn't meet your desired delivery schedule. I have faced huge problems recently. They didn't bother about customer any more. We all should avoid using Zomato",1
Worst app ever. Worst experience. They cancelled my order unfairly and deducted my money unfairly. And doesn't provide me any refund. When I tried to reach them they doesn't respond properly. Not gonna use this app any further. Poor service. I doesn't even want to give them any stars but without it they will not post my review.,1
"3rd class app. not even setting my address for delivery. its impossible to enter my home address. whenever i enter my address , always shows ""somthing gone wrong"". after try 3-4 times , i put my hope aside and order from swiggy. which i very easy to order rather zomato.",1
Zomato is charging cancellation charges even if im not cancelling the order. That means the food is collected by the rep of zomato against your prepaid order n then not delivered further to ypur doorstep and for some reason if you are not able to ans the calls by zomato or the rep of zomato then they unanimously cancel the order even without informing you. And if you call back after sometime to check for delivery then you are told to place the order all over again plus ypu will be charged the same amt of cancellation charge as food bill. Very unhappy,1
"I tried to order denier 4 times and it did not work. Shitest app you will ever use to order food, too many bugs and its always down and the worst chat support , screw this 👎. I've managed to order from talabat from the first click. You just lost a customer 👏",1
"best experience of ordering food :) The restaurant in which i went every single day just to take food and bring home is now on zomato and everything is now gets delivered on time. The UI of the app couldn't be better, the over-all experience of app usage is hassle-free.",5
Zomato help is useless if you have any order delay issues they will handover a rs 36 promo code . it took more than an hour to get my food delivered and when called up to valet he said his bike broke down . i understand this but there might be some criteria where he can pass this order to next valet . annoyingly dissapointed,1
Worst for delivering for eatery as it takes your current location as your delivery address and den charges penalty the customer for no reason. The customer doesn't get the order but has to pay the charges. That's pathetic bcoz they give the reason as wastage of food and they only cancel the order telling the customer that v can't reach out to u bcoz u r 3.3kms away from the restaurant,1
"Very good app to order foods , nice work by the developer and their delivery service is also good as compare to other apps thier selected restaurant and delivery man are also so skillful but the one thing that disappoint me that they do not give any pic. or quality about food, so please take a strong step on this...",4
Timely delivery is good but there are lot of items missing in the order zomato should take initiative to check whether all the items are give are not we are paying u money by beliving u . Simply u cannot blame restaurant and if I call restaurant they will blame u 😡😠😡 point is u zomato take initiative not merely delivery the quality and items should match what we are ordering,1
The worst app for food delivery where the problems of customers and not at all answered and ignored. They are also giving wrong records and updates to increase there sale and customer. They are only concern about the money and nothing else.,1
"At least respond to the customers when they email you, tell them if you can't be useful. Keeping them hanging and not replying isn't very professional. We shouldn't have to rate you on Playstore to get your attention. And take responsibility of your delivery persons actions, they are your employees.",1
Wonderful app. 100% recommendation to all my friends. always delivers on time. great deals and never fails to deliver customer satisfaction. atleast till now for me.,5
They do not have any contact number to call. Thrice they messed up with my order. Depending on chat services takes forever. For my last order Delivery boy was not good and for almost 2 weeks i have been chasing them for refund due to no fault of my own..with proofs .it is still in process though hopefully after multiple emails and not helpful team. Not at all good. they show fake ratings.,1
"I never get my order invoice even after following up 30 times per order. It always redirects me to the app, and then gets lost. Absolutely terrible customer service who keeps saying it will get sent, but never goes through.",1
"Wrong order delivered, add on items go missing. Zomato doesn't take responsibility for anything. It's not just one time thing unfortunately. It has been happening quite a few times.",1
"it's worst experience of mine with this app, they are not providing what you order amd then if u raise query against it they just simply told u that what we send you was what you have order, they not taking action against restaurant from where food was delivered nor taking action against the delivery men by which it was delivered.then zomato support chat sometimes it gives u answers in bit sometimes take hours, and there were no gauranty for solutions of this kind of problems.",1
"Zamoto support team is not good and needs to be educated how to behave with customer. Previous version zomato app was not functioning the right location,I added manually correct address to be delivered. Zamoto support team calls me up for the current order and says your address is incorrect and had a rude behaviour asking the address mentioned is not as per zomato application. I still wondered whether don't know my address am leaving.Zamoto app is updated, but can't ignore zomato rude bheviour",1
Don't buy Zamato Gold worst services they provide. They push you for 60 to 90 mins for delivery. They play psychological games to buy 30 mins plans. I have gold worth of 2k but no you have to buy delivery plan. Delivery boy do multiple deliveries and they don't care your food quantity and cold hot what ever. Shame zamato shame. I will show you chat history screenshot if someone need black side of zamato. Totally worst services.,1
"no option to change order feedback. even support team is helpless. if we ask them to change the feedback, they can't change. if you give 1 star on any order and wish to change it later, no option.",1
today I have experienced very bad that I comes to know if there is a mistake of delivery boy and application you will not get the refund for the order if you wanna order something do it on your risk because if this happens to you you won't get any refund in some cases like if delivery don't want to come to your place but still you have to pay for this,1
Price is affordable and the response is really good... They listen and reply... They know how to please customers.. I'm happy with this app...much much better than other apps where they don't even bother replying 👍,4
"very nice app with 50% discount up-to Rs 100. Service is prompt and the quality of food of the restaurants associated with zomato is excellent. I like this app, very easy to use.",5
"Pathetic Service by Zomato. I have ordered 50+ times with Zomato in past but my last two instances with Zomato was very bad. Two times they gave me missing order. First time, I ignored.I thought it may be a mistake. Second time, when this happened and I complained to them they asked me picture which I was not having as I was not aware of there PICTURE policy.They straight away told me they can't do anything.That day i felt like fool when with 50+ completed order,they don't trusted their customer",1
The Delivery guys take 2-3 orders to deliver. Now what safety measures are the guys taking after delivering the 1st order. The app only tells us of the sanitized guy when picking up of the order and not after delivering the 1st and 2nd order. Be aware if your order is in 2nd or 3rd.,1
its a very good app. i just would like the time to be mentioned before the restaurant stop accepting the orders makes it easier to know if your running out of time but in all honesty its better than some other app which give only limited options to choose from.,4
"While I use the app whenever I hv to order food, I have a few gripes If a restaurant is not accepting orders, you come to know only when you select the outlet If there is any extra charge again it should be mentioned upfront on the first screen",4
its a good app but . . some resturants have unreasonably high price for simple comfort food . . and so Ubereats is taking over this app nowadays . . so i would like to suggest you to make the prices a bit affordable from student point of view as well.,3
"Pathetic experience. They couldnot deliver the complete order. And instead of asking them to get the remaining order they offered money. I already spent money to get the order, if it's not delivered they shouldn't even bother to offer the refund but refund without questioning.",1
"It's not possible to give zero star, otherwise would've preferred it. We literally got wrong order delivered for more than 5 times in a span of 3 months. The rectifying process is also long and tidious.. not at all happy with their service. Not about delivery.",1
Worst service among all the delivery app.. They only repeat the same line again again. When I asked for the help they always say that from next time it will not going to repeat. That's really disgusting.,1
"i love this app the design is so user friendly .The only thing to be improved is prompt for selecting the saved address as it take a default address. I also get exclusive deals and promocodes, overall good experience",5
Please do not order from Zomato. I had ordered food and the delivery boy couldn't read my address and he cancelled it. When I followed up with them for my refund they said its the cancellation fees. First of all their own delivery boy cancelled the order and they charged me for that. If in case you are ordering from them please see that you choose cash on delivery. I had ordered same food from another food delivery app they delivered my food before time. Worst experience ever. Such a bad service,1
"Could've been better. Sometimes the rates seem too odd to consider ordering. I know it's business, but as a consumer I look forward to what is satisfactory as well as at a reasonable price.",2
food delivery time is too late and in your family child has waiting for food we pay the amount but food was coming too late take the amount also but food delivery some more time 30 minutes I will still waiting but no one take my order amount was detected so I will give the rating is zero Once again same repeated problems don't use the zomato app in delivery 40 minutes time to taken then we go to restaurant and eat it return to home to taken exit 43 minutes then why did use the zomato app,1
Highly disappointed with the app. ordered a pizza from Domino's and it got cancelled and money is not refunded in my account. nobody is taking responsibility for this. is this how you treat your customers? it's been more Than 20 days i am really disappointed.,1
High costs compared to restaurants,2
"I got worst experience with this zomato app, they are having some payment gateway problem, when i pay my bill amount of Rs.245 they took amount from my account but the order was not placed, I contacted the customer care executive, he said as we will process to return the amount and will credit to you within 7 days.... After 7 days when I call to them they said like ""We processed from our side this is not our issue"". Now almost 3 months are passed I dint get my money back... Be aware of Zomato",1
"It's too bad experience today,it was delivered too late,and the live tracking shows he is at restraunt,but am getting the notifications he's near by location.and am trying to reaching with my problemsthey are not able to sort of my problems regarding for food.i want to give zero rating,but there's no option.",1
"Zomato does not ask if you have received the order or not. It means restaurants can play us. I didn't receive the order and Zomato showed it delivered. Not only I waited for my order for several hours, but also not received my refund back.",1
"This app has made getting food delivered very easy. Sometimes it's very difficult to get change for COD because the boys will not have enough money, make an option for COD that before leaving restaurant they can get change from that place if possible.",4
"Be specific about restaurant delivery range. I ordered from Domino's, after half hour I received call from Domino's that they can't deliver order as your location is outside our delivery area, so kindly cancel order or pick up ur order from store. This is very ridiculous. And Domino's customer care is very rude,",1
"we have to pay full amount of order even though we have cancelled it because of their app, why we have to pay for your app's fault that it changes delivery location every time, even though i have saved my homes address and the custumer care guys says it our policy we cant do anything you have to pay the full amount of the order that you have cancelled. so be aware of this situation guys just dont use this app in swiggy it just asks you why you r cancelling and thats it they dont chrge for cancel.",1
"Seeing your offer for a particular restaurant, I tried to place an order with that particular restaurant. But while placing the order I couldn't find any option to put the offer. My experience was very bad .",1
Very bad app... Order placed directly without showing payment screen. Unable to apply coupon and change payment mode after menu selection. Customer care also deny to cancel the order. I contacted them within seconds after order was placed but they denied. After all i got the food and food was also not good from Sindhi Sweets.,4
"The email support team is very poor and they ask you to wait 24 hours for them to respond when you receive a damaged food , very much disappointed with your support team , you will loose customers if you keep asking them to wait for longer hours",1
"Be ware, now the delivery guy cancels your order if you are a minute late and you get NO REFUND. Faced it today. Customer Care doesn't care. This way any order can get cancelled and the money is also gone. Other services like Swiggy or Eatsome at least refund the money. Be Aware guys.",1
"Worst thing is to not replying to the customers email subject to refund process. Zomato delivery is good but the information, guiding, resolving customers problems system is very worst, as i experinced from them, My one order was placed before the hotel situated in borivali, they debited order amount from my account and also not delivered the food, after some time i checked that the order was rejected but still today i havn't received any amount from zomato helpline syatem. kindly please resolve.",1
No need to explain but food delivered often is stale and poorly packed by high class restaurents too. Zomato has to understand not only delivery of food is part of its service but also what you people deliver is also important.I am sick of eating the remaining stale food of hotels/cafe .I have observed it so many times.,1
"really good offers on food , on time delivery and any fault in packaging or other food related problems were solved with care , it really helped when i really needed something special to eat .... ordering on Zomato has become my routine job ,😁",5
"Running fake 'on time delivery or cash back' promotions. I was not given any promo code till I contacted the support and the promo code that they gave after I contacted was an expired one. Now when I contacted them, they are saying that the coupon was already expired and they can't renew the date or give a new one!",1
"App is good but recently they started being passive aggressive in their notifications. For example telling me how the guy who is delivering food is poor and he needs to support his family back home, implying that I should give him money. This is not nice. Why for change you don't pay them more so I don't need to do that instead of you? Don't be passively aggressive to your users please. Another thing, they removed customer support chat!Very annoying! Only some useless automated replies. Very bad!",2
"My Favourite App not because of offers only, but the service is very fast and resolve your issue very quickly. Once I had received order with very less Quantity. I complained and I received same order again without any extra charges 😍",5
The app is good but not very good. There are many restaurants available but we cant order at all. Some times it shows only the menu but there are no options of placing order.,4
"Not upto the standard. I have been facing repeated issues. Please review your refund policy and make it customer friendly, the current policy is an utter disaster. Delivery speed is good 👍.",2
"I am satisfied with the service quality zomato provides. The logistics, the food, the time to complete order, live tracking everything is perfect. I just want to have more useful offers as a loyal customer of this app.",5
"The ""Delivery"" and ""Dine Out"" options are sometimes confusing. Would be convenient if you could add a ""Does Not Deliver"" under restaurants I might be searching for and whose menu and other options pop up.",4
"Always they have a problem with delivery stuff........they always have a late delay alongwith it they accuse us out ofnothing. One of the worst food delivery app. never, gonna order via this app. Charged me incorrectly out of no fault.......... this is ridiculous.",1
When i mention the address in zomoto why can't zomoto can take the address once...??? I should have to mention the address Everytime... otherwise address is changing automatically to a different area and they are delivering to wrong address. It really really really irritating. Meanwhile I can buy the item instead of explaining the address. They can't even understand the address even when i explain the location. only once or twice i got a product to the right location.,2
"i placed an order and paid through paytm, there was some issue wrt address as per delivery guy and i was informed we donot deliver at ur address and not only is my order getting cancelled my amount wouldnt be refunded too, i talked to some support guy who advised me to raise the issue by mailing them...i hve got no response n now no support person is attending my request..since i prepaid the order i feel being exploited..NEVER PAY BEFOREHAND, forget abt resolution, u r not going to be attended",1
this app deserves less than a zero star as recently I noticed that some third party advertisement pops up and when I traced it it was caused by this app. yes your service is wonderful but the fact that you want to remind me to order food is not nice of you and not professional at all. so you deserve a zero star because you do not only advertise for yourself but to other services and apps which is something I never signed up for. you should stick to food delivery or else you'll lose customers.,1
"Zomato delivers food from restaurants, which very very near to the person ordering. Unlike uber and swiggy it has a very limited radius. Very difficult to get food from the restaurants, which could be easily delivered by uber!",1
"Even though I have not done any suspicious activity then also my account has blocked to place any online order. Customer support is also unable to provide any solution. Multiple times they are sending reply that its blocked by system, they cannot do anything. Means there is no admin of this app who can manage the users even though you are a active user. Really very pathetic user management system you guys are having. Seems other food delivery applications are better.",1
I give it 5 star but there is a little bit problem infact it is a big problem as most of time when i want to order something it says currently not accepting orders.But when i open zomato on other device such as on my laptop it is open and accepting orders..so please make this problem correct. Allover the app is good.. Thanks..,5
"Offers are quite good but Something is wrong , The issue is about the prices .. the prices on this app is far higher than restaurant actual menu card rates..if you are giving discount to the customers so why is the price higher than actual prices..it means at the end The Customers are paying more on this app..",3
Delivery order cannot be placed anymore. Payment functionality fails and app simply shows a message on the screen asking user to check if any order got placed. It is surprising that such a basic feature does not work.,1
Please check update and app is cool super,5
I paid through phone pe and for the same order got paid twice..i thought the extra credit will be returned to my account but no..i have received none.when i tried to contact customer support there were no keyboard for me to type..and there was an automatic reply from my side which mentioned my order number and date horribly wrong..is this kind of customer support you guys offer??,5
"It was the absolute worst, they overcharge, the delivery person does not make an effort to contact and if the order is prepaid and then cancelled by the delivery guy then they won't refund your money.",1
had a very wonderful experience where my order was picked up and the delivery guy never showed up and vanished into the air never got the order delivered. zomato have no call centre and super dumb chat centers which is useless and no speedy response. my family had to starve for long hours because of this wonderful service,1
"its really awesome, thank you guys for making this awesome application. this aap bring the restaurants at our door step. feeling happy to rate this aap. but the 3 star because of the customer care support, calling features not available, you guys should work on this.",3
"Third order in a roll with issues. Previous two took about 2 and half hours and lots of calls needed to sort out. Third one from a MacDonald's about 500m away, which never arrived. Order cancelled. Will never use this app again.",1
I used to use zomato 4 to 5 times in a week But after my latest experience i am not gonna use this app again i ordered food and it says food will be delivered in half an hour but when it was not delivered in 45 minutes i opened zomato app and it says food was delivered i didn't received order.I tried to call delivery boy but his phone was busy all the time and after some time he switched off his phone.when I contacted zomato they said they can't do anything about it...worst customer care service,1
The gps always shows my wrong address so there is delay in order and also delay in reaching my home. Due to this the food does not remains hot. I complained several times and also set my home exactly moving pin in map but no resolution.,3
"pathetic service GPS not works properly than they will add address your current location as address, where i have been never before than after sometime they will call you just to inform you that your order will not be delivered you will have to cancel it without any refund claim. they fooled there customers",1
Poor service! Delivered food after 2hrs and it was spoilt.. It takes ages to get a resolution.. just money making and nothing else.. no option to cancel due to policy although we have to wait for hours together for them to deliver cheap quality food! Ridiculous,1
The app has been super helpful. and it's the best a working family can have. it would get the 5 star rating if they could work on their staff a little more. overall it's a life saver.,4
"As the app promise me you I will get free refund if I dont get order with in 28 minutes, now its telling my location is changed but it's not true they took 45 minutes priper food and I got my food after 2 and half hours , And they charged 10 rs extra. Very disappointed with it .",1
The order is still not delivered after 3 4 hours . The issue has happened multiple times . I believe zomato is not at all concerned about customer service and satisfaction. They don't care whether the customer gets the service or not. They just want the order money in advance,1
Best online food delivery app,5
i had the worse experience. the delivery boys cant even check the distance thenselves. apparently my home which was less than 5kms from restaurant was seen as 12 kms in his phone. zomato does not even have a good delivery service... had the most horrible experience... on top of that... the customer executive was very rude ... and couldn't even solve a small missunderstanding... i am hungry for last one hour and then finally when its time for order to arrive... they cancel the order...🖕,1
"Pathetic Service by Zomato. useless alp unless you are just exploring... never ever order through Zomato. i ordered food at 3:16 PM and till 4 PM the foos was being prepared. the order was as simple as a chicken noodles and a manchurian. upon calling their delivery guy says the restaurant is running out of ingredients and it will take another 30 minutes. when i wanted to cancel the order, zomato says i will be charged Rs.120 for cancellation. Pathetic",1
"With every update this app is getting more annoying and more stupid! It was much better before , now when you close the app and re open it it restarts all over! Also no more history of recently searched places and many other annoying things Bring back the old zomato!",1
"Worst customer service... Incorrect orders will be sent and we try contacting customer support they'll have a set of automated responses and there won't be any resolution at all.. they are all a bunch of scamsters looting money from people.. not sure even the listed restarants even exist or not.. learn something from your competitor swiggy., They r best customer service people... And u on. D other hand... R literally thieves",1
very bad experience. ordering continuous from same restaurant to same address thn also the delivery guy didn't reached on the location and when i told them to deliver to my address they cancelled my order and the money was fully charged for cancellation. i don't want to give 1 star also but had no option,1
It is very worst app. I took zomato gold membership but without any notification it changes into pro. I paid for 1+1 offer on food no for take 20% discount. Zomato is fooling customer it gives membership for 1+1 on food and 2+2 on drinks but zomato is not giving this service. I have wasted my money i will suggest u will not take any membership on zomato 🙏🙏🙏 thnk u.,1
Terrible... i tried to cancel my order immediately after placing the order..there is no cancellation option and the customer support is not at all supportive. i am uninstalling the app.. even after repeatedly calling the restaurant the order was not cancelled .. im highly disappointed,1
"Worst service, they accept order even if the restuarant is closed. After wasting 20 min time they say order is cancelled. This is the 5th time the same happening to me. If a restuarant is closed, mark it as closed. I guess your common sense has gone for a toss",1
very worst thing happening with zomato. i had issues with last 3 orders and the solution given is again a loss for me. zomato never mention conditions and when question raised on same there is no answer. it was showing min order value 100 for cashback and when i claim for the same you guys were saying min order is 200. there is no correct response and time taking things. im gonna uninstall this app.,1
very very bad app....not refund the cancellation amount if you want to cancel the order then the amount will not refund you back which is not useful for all of us....I suggest you that please don't download this app this is not good for us...i am not interested to give then 1 star i want to give them 0 star...they take my more than 200 rupees,1
"Worst app i cannot put my exact location in this app have to do through gps and maps, which doesnt show proper address. Cannot write my room no or building name. There should be an option to write it manually like other app. I would rather consider other food ordering app.",1
"You have cheated well. I have ordered for the first time but the company has no control over its employees, they canceled my order with their favor. Anyway, I have no problem with canceling my order, but my refund has not yet been credited to my account. The company representative told me that it will return me in 4 to 5 working days.",1
I dont know what would I have done without Zomato. Amazing offers and good food. However their refund policy is not good. When the food is bad only a part of the money is refunded instead of the entire amount.,3
"I gave this app 5 star for their services but recently their degraded performance am giving it 1 star... they don't take any security of your food, if restaurant serves you expired food they don't refund you back... last day i ordered chicken meal of 96 in which chicken was totally expired and smelled badly so threw it to the dustbin and complained them and they returned me just 24 credits.. I complained but they even don't bother to reply you... Disgraceful service",1
"This app is awful. There appears to be no way to view all restaurants in a mao view instead of list. When you want to search a specific neighborhood, results always include restaurants nowhere near that neighborhood. Results also frequently include restaurants that have long since closed. UrbanSpoon was an awesome app. It's a shame that Zomato bought it and destroyed it.",1
"The worst app for food delivery, since last 1 month my orders are continuously getting delayed. Today u guys crossed the limits delay of 1.45 mins serving cold food, customer care is saying so what we can't do anything abt this now.. Nothing could be worse then this its better go for DUNZO, SWIGGY OR UBER EATS Zomato is now big company they don't care about there regular customer anymore. So don't waste your time on this silly app filled with alot of bugs",1
I ordered today with online payment but it will take lot of time to deliver also zomato valet attitude is also very annoying i order my food at 9.37pm and it supposed to deliver with in half an hour but your valet is not picking up the phone nd not deliver the food yet  And there is no option to call customer care  I never used this app again and suggest everyone also don't used it very dispointing,1
Pathetic customer support again from Zomato. I have been getting an error while placing any order through the app. Everytime I try to reach out to help.. it diverts to an automated dumb chatbot. There seems to be no way to speak with someone directly. I am Gold member from a long time and now getting serious double thoughts about finding another service.,1
"I ordered a biryani from zomato and kept tracking the movement of the delivery guy in the maps. The restuarant was about just a mile away. The delivery guy seemed to be roaming around instead of delivering my order. After one hour 10 mins i had to contact the support and they were not of help either. One of the saddest experinces. Please dont play around with a hungry person, some advice.",1
search result vary for the same search terms.. if no valet is available it sometimes shoes that the restaurant is not accepting orders. online chat support is pathetic. it shows wait time as 1 min and instead u have ti wait fir 5-10 mins with no reply !!,1
"Map pin point location works fine at user end, not properly working at delivery person side.. Every time we spent more time to explain delivery location, customer care executives not give proper answer for that, simply told go and enjoy your meal.",2
Please disable the pop up of Location not updated. Everytime I open the app it pops up even when the location is correct. It's so irritating to close it every single time. The address is saved already so it doesn't make sense to keep showing it everytime.,4
"While choosing from menu the prices shown are less but while making payment the prices are increased. Also from the time zomato has started offering free orders if delivered after the given time, the realtime status of the delivery is not shown.",1
"poor app'will never use again', they have not assigned my order to resturant and their support team told me you will get in 15 min, after 1 hour.30min they have cancelled my order, and then I have to order using talabat , great service they delivered in 20 min.",1
This delivery has the worst quality of customer service. They leave you hanging till the very end. I just waited for over an hour after making online payment for food that never showed up and horrible customer service. Thanks for nothing. Switching to Uber Eats.,1
Super discounted Offers and fast delivery is always needed and zomato does exactly that everytime. You can rely on it anytime of the day. Refunds and return payments are much easier and reliable with zomato chat assistant. You can sit back and relax at your will once you place your order. Zomato even gives credits and piggybank money options for further discounts and offer.,5
The support tram doesn't actually contact you and apparently they listen only to the restaurant. When I contacted them stating parts of the order was missing they said they cant do anything about it. Poor support function.,2
"Online Order features are very poor. No option to cancel the order once placed but they can cancel our order when they like. No option to call customer care even. If a restaurant is not delivering food, this app doesn't refund the amount which is basically scamming.",2
It's so difficult to order food. Ideally it should take like 5 minutes but because the restraunts keep on switching their online ordering on and off it takes like 25 minutes to order food. I hated this experience.,1
Very bad experience....... My prepaid order canceled two times due to riders mistake but they do not even gave my order as well as do not refund my money after cancelation of my prepaid order..... On chat helpbox they asked to refund but i dont get my money back..... Too mch bad experience......... Genuine customer willl not come after this.,1
Excellent staff service....,5
it's a very nice app and I think everyone should install it and try it at least one time and I think so that if you will try it once you can't control yourself to use it again and again because it's really a nice app and the way they treat you and the functions of the app are also so good,5
"The new update causes the app to slow down. I cannot browse since I am always directed to the delivery page. Also, I have to wait a long time just to find the zomato gold pages to claim my complimentary dish.",2
Food usually takes about 1 hour to deliver.. Which is way far and worst than it's competitors. The only good this is zomato gold membership.. you get 1 disk free if your order is 300 above.. Everytime I order on this app I lost my appetite... Not a Good way to please foodie.,2
the customer service is really bad.. they don't even bother to acknowledge the issue and expect it to be solved without doing anything.. the only people are using this app is because of the options they get but there is no before/after service provided,1
"One of the worst customer care service team in the whole market... Before downloading keep in mind there is no one to one talk , can talk only with txt msgs on the app and it is fixed that no complaint will be entertained.. if love your money don't go for it",1
"Very bad customer service.3star rating in Cheating and looting money from people. If they were not able to provide order, they could have informed customer and cancel the order. But these people accepting orders and not providing it on time instead they were cancelling orders themselves stating customer not responded and not even refunding the money. How can they say customer not responded ??? Inspite of hunger , how can someone will deny food??",3
"App works good and is helpful but delivery service is horrible. Most of the Delivery guys are not aware of routes which results in consistently delayed orders. If you are using prepaid or have guests at your place, please use Swiggy else for CoD Zomato is just okay.",2
Really helpful and easy to use. Very secure about payments and offers move round the corners throughout the year 🤘. You can make amazing use of this when far from home...!!! Such amazing delivery status at small city like cuttack is just amazing. Overall its a nice app.,5
The delivery and food were all upto the mark but i would prefer if you change the delivery utensils try to replace black plastic dishes with some biodegradable dishe which is safe to store and pack both cold and hot food because all of us are aware that hot food in plastic containers is injurious to health. I hope you consider my reviews and try to work on it.,2
"I'm familiar with the hotel dish prices that I eat regular.... But zomato pricing is min 20 rs extra, than the actual rate of the dish in a specific hotels, they should keep someone to verify the prices! Personally so that they don't keep their items overpriced in app.... Bcoz Zomato charges 50 rs as delivery charge!",3
I have ordered for a cake from a bakery and it was worse...I tried connecting with Zomato but there is some error showing in app . I also tried calling the customer care no. but that came to be an invalid one.. I want my refund for the payment i have done. It was my first attempt and probably the last. Will strongly recommend not to use this app.,1
"One of the worst customer care. Whatever mention in the mail, I get the following copy paste reply. Nothing else. Not even mention of solution. ""Hope you're doing well and sincere apologies in the delay in responding to you.  We apologize that you weren't provided with a satisfactory resolution. We always pride ourselves in providing our customers with a seamless support experience and feel the disappointment for not being able to live up to your expectations. ....""",1
"i want to give 0 star rating. As its not possible, I'm giving single star. I have ordered from ZOMATO and received entirely wrong item. I have reached zomato chat support who kept me waiting for 40 mins. After 40 mins , they replied to me and closed conversation in the same minute as saying there is no response from me. Worst customer service which I ever experienced.",1
Bakwas App h... one delivery person given to multiple orders where in the customer has to wait for hours their order to be delivered & also they charge cancellation charge when you cancel the order for late delivery h. 1 star se niche nhi h kuch agar hota to wahi deti... Filhal ke liye app uninstall kar rhi hu....,1
Horrible application which keeps on throwing the ball towards the restaurant and keeps you in a situation as if you're the only who is going to suffer. They just need their 22% commission from restaurants which they once you order from them. Pathetic service.,1
"The selection of restraunts is better than other apps ,but increase the discounts guys. Most of the orders i assume are from students or working bachelors, not all middle class families are regular customers and the really rich folks have their own chefs & may even prefer actual restraunt dining than ordering food online.",3
the most third class fooding app. never install it. it takes on your order and delivery takes more than a hour when you as to cancel they ask for the payment to be added on your next order. instead use swiggy it is far far far more better,1
As i have received incomplete order on 28th april 2019 and till the date i have not received the pending credit amount of Rs.60...Every time when i chat with Customer support executive regarding my credit amount they only say that we have initiated and the amount will be credited in 24-48 hrs....more than 5 times i have conversation with them and every time answer is same from their end..Very Bad Service,1
Please try to give refund if the order is cancelled within a limited time period...🙄 I've had cancelled my order within 1 minute after placing it because I changed my mind... & your excuse for not refunding me the money back was that the restaurant has started preparing the food. Like seriously..!!?? Who starts preparing food so fast...🙃 Even Rajni (Can't). Sorry Not Sorry...🙃,2
"I had a painful and pathetic experience, I had placed the order in dominos on 16th Nov 2019 at 10:03pm, I haven't received any order and after 1hr I got messages that order has been delivered, bledy you guys doesn't have any customer care also to raise the concerns and restaurants like dominos minting the money from common man.",1
Had terrible experience with first order itself. Money got deducted even before i could notice. And within 10 sec turned to cancel the mistaken order and the support says it is already being prepared and cannot get cancelled. Now who starts preparing order within 10 seconds. Thats ridiculous.,1
"Why are we paying for Zomato Gold or Pro as you call it these days? Most of the times the ""additional 30% discount"" that you keep displaying doesn't work. It keeps giving error once the promo code is applied. So end of the day, I am as good as non-pro customer? Is this some sort of trick? Also, if the restaurant delivers wrong items of less price, you are not replying to the customers for the refund. No body responds to the emails sent with screen shots. Where are the ethics gone?",1
Recommended waste of using this app. There is no providing customer service. Waste and worest thing with fake promise. I had ordered the food yesterday the order was taken confirmation after 30mins so I called the restaurant and cancel my order they said we did not get any order and not working zomato chat for long time and no response from them. After 1hour zomato executive calls me food is prepared I said that I had already said to restaurant cancel my order after some long time I got call from zomato and said order cancelled money will be credited to your account within 24hrs. After 1day I didn't credit my amount till now so I try to ask them through zomato chat now they are saying not able to refund. Bloody customer service making with fake promises. There is no value for customer money. How can they charge without providing food for customer. Waste of app I hate it.,1
"Worst experience in delivering food . The drivers are not aware of the route. For a hotel which is only 20 mins away, the driver after picking the order took 50 mins to deliver the food. I could have a picked the food myself .. Feeling pathetic for using this app to placemy order. At least would have opted for other services like Swigy. Worst experience ever and this is no way near to the customer service given by UBER.",1
"Always a bad experience. These people just cancel your order without any thoughts. Last time, I ordered cake for my parents'anniversary..2 hours later they cancelled saying there's some technical issue and almost all the bakeries were about to close by then. Today again, they cancelled my order without any prior information and an alternative. ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING. One time, I ordered an ice cream tub and found a screw in it ...informed Zomato via twitter..but no one cared to give a call back",1
waste of time ordering if we canc the order they make penalty charges equals our order cost waste of ordering in this app and also am not getting non veg orders....waste of ordering...,1
"I placed my first order today. A valet was assigned, then again reassigned to another valet. By the time the second valet reached the restaurant my order was cancelled automatically by Zomato even though the food was kept ready by the restaurant. Poor customer service. Chat option is terrible. Had to then place order through Swiggy. First Zomato order and such a bad experience.",1
Cancellation fees charged for delivery accidentally put at wrong address despite giving them a heads on to do the same within minutes of placing the order. Initially the customer service executive was not even ready to give any refund. Horrible experience. Never ordering through this app again.,1
Very good service!!,5
The worst experience with zomato. I placed order but want to cancel it. They didn't allowed me to cancel it. I tried to reach out to them via chat 7min was waiting time to chat. I waited for 7min min time I asked hotel to keep order on hold. food was not yet prepared. I had chat after 7min with support team and they told that they cant cancel the order and they will not provide any refund. Then I received call from support and started conveniencing to accept order and declined refund. Worst Worst,1
"They have improved their delivery services. I can see they are out with a new UI also. All in all its a very handy app. If you are in India, you need to have Zomato, will save a lot of your time in one way or the other.",4
"Don't use this app. They will not be giving proper food. And also don't refund the money if you cancle the order. They keep saying lie that the order was deliver from our end, so no refund will be given.",1
Very Costly: For order of Rs. 130 i paid Rs 45 as delivery. So costly deal!. Other apps are much better and provide great discount unlimited times. Learn from other apps. Response for your query below: I have written in simple english read once more you will understand.,1
"Finally this brand also starting to show its true colors. I ordered food for my mom by her mobile only. And set payment method as CoD. After ordering the food, 2 hrs had been passed but no sign of delivery guy or any food. Delivery guy was not picking my call and when i contacted customer care through chat, they said he's busy on another call, lol 🤣. It means, You just want to deduct online money instantly and loot from customers, as you have no refund policy. You are Uninstalled now 🖕",1
"this is the worst food ordering app ever. the restaurant declines ur order and u arent even told about it till you actually make an attempt to chat with their very inefficient chat support. happened 2 days in a row. secondly, if the customer cancels the order from their end he is charged the full bill amount as cancellation fee. but if zomato cancels it from their end 12 credits is what u get. yes u read that figure right! Thieves is what i can call you",1
Very bad customer care service. Repeatedly received bad conditioned food. When it came time to them to refund you money they give you zomato credits. Would stop using such an app. I recommend to use Uber eats instead of this app. Sometimes they take out option of cash on delivery so that we pay in advance and then they give you bad service and in compensation they will give u zomato credits to shut your mouth.,1
Superb Service n enjoy with zomato,5
The orders on various occasions have come incomplete and not just from this account. On different accounts. This happens regularly. Mostly from taco bell. Zomato should really have a procedure where they double check the order before leaving the restaurant.,1
"8 out of 10 times you will be disappointed. e. g., They deliver wrong items while we pay higher price for some other item. Getting them refund the difference amount is extremely difficult, not possible most of the times. So basically cheating. Took 2 hrs to deliver an order once.",1
"So far the best and the greatest food ordering app. You can order food, check reviews, look at the images of the food and restaurants you are ordering from. Read and write reviews as well.",5
"better than other food services, offers are available everyday good for the people who they don't have enough time to cook food or go out and eat, really very good experience until now.",4
Good & fast service provided. I also get a good discount. Quality of food depends on the restaurant from where you order. So there's no fault of application or delivery boy. So I'm satisfy with there work.,5
"Delivery executive canceled the order since he couldn't reach to address and after more than a hour I get to know that order is canceled that to 11 in night, after this I was not refunded my money back stating that send a mail if you need your money back. Just don't go for installation.. It's worst.",1
worst experience about money refund. mailed the whole issue. i think the should have been developed with more ease. there should be areas of cancellation of order as well as fast customer connectivity chat.,1
Too bad experience . i was a regular user..but they cancelled my order 2 times in a week.one time cancelled from restaurant side after 1 hr from order..so simply wasted my time. another one cancelled while bringing food by delivery guy..they said some technical issue..such an Irresponsible people..dnt knw hw to retain customers,1
"Service is becoming bad day by day.... In the starting you were good... Now a days I don't even want to open this app.. you guys are just looting in the name of the pendemic... Nice collaboration with the resturants guys, ask them to increase the price more one day we will find the price of food is more than gold. Don't want to use bad words for you all since some day back ou were there to feed me ... Sad u lost a user today.... keep your profit earning guys... 🙏🏻",2
"good as of now.. ordered 5 times, and got it delivered. but mostly the delivery boy details seems to be wrong. it is written that he can speak english, hindi, tamil, telegu. but most of them can't speak hindi or english which is an issue while contacting them",4
Very good application every Order Delivery on time any location,5
I too had problem with zomato previously. Some times parcel was partially open and some times liquids were completely spill out from container. Delivery executives many times are Un professional. Still I tolerated all these days. After reading many reviews since two days I got a lot of information about ZOMATO. INow feel like Uninstalling ZOMATO. Good Bye ZOMATO.,1
"They could improve on the edit order part, which is very very very primitive as on date compared to any other app. Sorry Zomato but it's a pain to order with this kind of an experience. This would be my last order on Zomato until you improve upon your app",1
"Worst customer service ever. I would advise all to never order from them as their goal is to just take money from customers without wanting to provide service for it. They cancelled my dinner order without talking to me first; the delivery boy was the rudest I'd met and worst of all, they didn't even have the decency to refund my money. So I was left hungry at night without food, without refund and without any service. Swiggy and Uber eats are much better. Never order from Zomato.",1
Had really a stupid experience using zomato... I got the ice cream totally melted like water ...and the support team asked me to reach out to their mail I have written a clear description attaching the pics of the package i recieved.. Without resolving the problem...they asked me to rate the support...and asked for feedback... Swiggy is a healthy and hygiene food delivering app..which meant for literates.. And zomato is a local & street - food delivering app Never encourage zomato,1
"Completely Waste of money, waste of time.. Multiple bad experience with ZOMATO. Ordered more than three times.. Every time I got the worst experience of food. I reached the customer care but they only accepted the mistake but never refunded. They are trained, knows what and how to reply and apologize.",1
"placed an order and cancelled within a minute. zomato isnt ready to refund the amount... moreover their support system is so unresponsive, they take about 10 minutes to respond to each line... and the support staff was totally unprofessional. this time it just crossed the line.",1
Worst experience and never thought would have to go through the pain to just chat when the order is not delivered after an hour than the scheduled time. Just cancel the order is what i requested but there is no response from the support. Pathetic.,1
"Don't buy pro.. You will get 10 percent off on selective restaurant with a condition of minimum buying of rupees 500 or more. So no use. Now, they bring new feature you can't order sometimes below 350 rupees whether you are pro or not. So, Nil benefits of Pro. Zomato has lost its charm after lockdown. Now, It's just picking your pocket. Today, I tried to order some food, it asked52 rupees as delivery charges which includes 20 rupees of distance fee for a delivery just 900 meters away!!",1
one of the worst platform for ordering food. i ordered food and it was incirrect item delivered. i asked thriugh chat to refund which thry have denied as they said it is not in their policy. i cant give zero star reviews as there is no sich option. pathetic customer service executive response whose name is shubham. there is only chat option available for complain as owr hima dn there is no customer care email ir or contact number. please beware of these cheaters. not interested.,1
"The new features that have been added in Zomato are not good. You can't see the live tracking, can't see who's your Zomato vallet and their number so that in case if any order gets delayed, one can know through the vallet. Not liking these features at all!",3
My money has been cut multiple times and the order will be canceled. They don't refund the money back. Customer service is below average compared to other online eatouts. Decent for food delivery. But support is very bad. Try your luck.,1
"Customer support is worst, useless, pathetic. People on chat support does not reply for hours. I used to place approximately 3 to 5 orders per day but Zomato doesn't seem to value the feedback. Literally they always try to mould the issue and blame the restaurant for an issue which is an operational issue for Zomato.",1
"Trying to connect with cc, but none responding..Orders delivery times Re 1 hr 20 min but order are getting delayed beyond that too.. its 2 hrs but neither any response from restaturant and nor zomato chat bot responding...after 2 hrs executive appear and saying smae old stuff...sorry sorry sorry..it will repeat again...but who will value the time of customer...at this late hour of nght, which rest. will deliver...really absurd",1
It's useless all ever it take your money when you goes to use 60% or any other offer then you need to pay online then after this app will cancel your order and give a refund after 7 days and that 7 days your money will use for any kind of activity. It's useless app ever swiggy is 110% better than this please don't install this kind of useless apps,1
They never have the answer for any issue..we will improve next time that's it..i ordered the food at 12:30 and received at 2:40 & didn't assigned their valet for the order..after waiting for 2 hours they have the answer..we will improve next time & for this ans we have to wait for another 30 mins..if you do not have control over restraunts and you have to solve our queries by just saying these copy paste lines then shut down your services..experience with zomato is becoming more bad day by day..,1
A great app for a foodie. Provides every minute details about every second restaurant in the city of your choice.Detailed reviews of customers as well as food bloggers add a lot more value to it.A perfect app it looking for a good restaurant to dine out tonight.,5
There is no support from the team,1
Wrost app charged a cancellation fees even after 2 min i cancelled the order after being ordered. I have never seen any company to being this level of rudness. They says the food will be waste for them. But when i personally talked to restaurant they says that they didnt started to prepare the order.,1
After payment restaurants need to accept your order if it decline then your payment will be on account of zomato.then you need to make nxt purchase from zomato so you can redeem your on account money maybe it decline again because restaurants staff find location is far from them.thats happen to me twice and navigate was set before place the order.,2
"First time experience in Kolkata , Newtown area was too bad. I ordered sweets, which has no preparation time at all, still it took 2 hours to deliver within an area of 7-8 kms. Not at all upto the level of other food ordering apps. The Zomato app is fancy, but not delivery.",1
"Worst app! I ordered pizza from it and they asked to wait for 33 min. After 30 min they said order is not accepted while they have given me order accepted notification at the time I have ordered it. So, either you give them 10 Rs extra for on time delivery or they are going to starve you.",1
"Very bad service is being delivered by zomato. I have ordered food on 5th Aug and zomato app showed the food has been delivered but I did not get food. When I called zomato delivery person he told, his phone number is getting used wrongly and he doesn't have any order with him. He left the company long back. What sought of service is this.?",1
Delivery is always Late and zomato doesn't care as they are just ordering partners. The restaurant is responsible for delivery. None care. Zomato gold is a scam. After upgrade there are hardly 2 restaurants with gold for delivery and that are asking minimum order of 300 which was not mentioned during payment. If such hidden conditions were disclosed I wouldn't buy gold membership in the first place.,1
"The amount discount giving is less then the showing tax in each product.. Good facility, but tax in each product is not 18% its some time more than 50% also... This should be mention in each restaurant after opening in zamato... While ordering this should not be added..",3
"Delivered in time, good response from delivery boy. No damages to the food packings",4
"Bad experience. They have resturant which don't deliver even though app says they deliver and then you need to struggle with chat bot if the resturant cancel your order. Lot of time is wasted in this, then u have to struggle for food.",1
"very poor service quality. Looting money from customers. Never pay online, only go for cash on delivery. or else in case you need to cancel they will charge full amount as penalty and no refund. Customer service executive wont even reply on chat. They dont even answer to your mails.",1
"Good , help this app during emergency",5
"Terrible company with terrible customer service. The app allows you to register, pay and order food but no live customer or delivery support. Ordered yesterday, restaurant falsely claimed could not deliver to hotel. Both Zomato and restaurant falsely claim to not be able to reach me at hotel. Even though they have gotten through on last 2 orders. And no response from Zomato about this order yet. They took my money however. I will be disputing this on my credit card for nondelivery of product/svc",1
Nonsense of a service.Zamato should shut down its services.This is the 3rd time that my order was cancelled in thr last 1 month. It says order item out of stock...wherever the hotel is ready with the order. The delivery boy waited for 30mins and then had to leave because his app showed order has cancelled. Wherein I didnt cancel the order. At 12 o'clock in the night if this happens then what should a customer do. I strongly recommend all my contacts not to use Zomato for any delivery. Pathetic,1
"Worst service, no check on orders received. Vendor accept as they receive the order. They do not check if they have that item or not. I ordered dal chawal just now and vendor call me and said I do not have that but I have accepted your order. Which was pre paid. I cannot camel it I am sending chicken biryani for you. I told him I am a vegeterian, yet he sent the order with rider . Pinged chat support they said order is delivered we cannot refund. What a wonderful service zomato.",1
Can be more user friendly with more options,3
"The prices are too high(~20% higher+delivery charge) in comparison to the actual resturent price. The offers available in the app is just to make you fool. Don't belive in it, it's a trap to waste your money.",1
"I just order some food ,at the time of payment all the transactions had been done .The money is debited from my a/c and it says that the payment has been failed. I'm still waiting for refunding my money !!!!",1
We order quite often and it's been really efficient so far apart from a few glitches and late deliveries. It's quite user friendly and has many good offers on a daily basis. You can find almost all kinds of restaurants/cuisines.,3
Zomato can improve the UI by making it easier to use for the one who is new to ordering food. Keep the app simple. Remember that ordering food online is a very personal experience.,3
"We take such things for granted, but today I wanna express huge gratitude to Zomato for its amazing service, getting food was never before easier...Kudos to the app DESIGN team.... just perfectly done with intricate elements which brings so much comfort while ordering !!!!",5
"New app is heavy, lags and error all the time (something went wrong,please try again) and need a lot of data to keep going on Terrible since the app decided to focus more on Gold. Deleting photos is a hassle,however i'm glad that now we have the explore feed. Would be better if you bring back following tab too",3
Delivery time excellent but main concern foods quality and quantity are tooo bad & rubish. Delivery boy & Zomato also responsible for the poor quality. Discounts are good but too much discounts are not healthy for customers. Don't provide vogus discount s.. provide good quality foods.,1
I've been using Zomato for a while now. The sheer improvement they've made shows their commitment towards the service. A suggestion for future update - kindly include an option to blacklist/block certain restaurants from appearing in recommendations.,5
"I have ordered paneer fried rice in a mid-range restaurant for the first time. Delivery was quick. But the quality of the food was very very poor. The food was prepared without a drop of oil, Even rice was not boiled properly. Within 30 min, the rice got dried. Again my mom fried the rice by pouring enough oil.",1
"Don't use this app. The delivery boy cancelled my order for no reason and the money was also not refunded. Their chat support is rude and the mail support is also unhelpful. Unless you always pay in cash, you will be cheated off your money.",1
Pathetic is the only word that is apt for this. U get charged for an item in ur order but that does not get delivered to u (generally sides). And the cust serv is least bothered to make the delivery happen forget about refund. They make money like this.,1
"Location selected by the zomato is very much worst. It accepts orders for unknown road, but not near by villages. The location accepting criteria should be as per the population basin or village basis but not by drawing a circle from town.",1
"The customer support of the organization sucks. My problem with zomato gold subscription stays unresolved more than a week. I've renewed my gold membership but somehow I can't use it in the city I'm staying in. Couldn't reach out to anyone regarding it. They only have email support and chat support in the app, on which the messages never gets delivered instantly, it takes 5 minutes to get delivered and the support guy replies if he feels like. Absolutely disappointed with the whole experience.",1
Zomato accept your order very smoothly and the time of delivery they decided which customer they want to deliver fast and same time they waiting for the 2nd customer whose schedule time is over more than 45-50 minutes to automatically cancelled his/her order.... very pathetic service provider they are........ I have recently very good experienced about their service,1
"Zomato really is upsetting now they dont want to help customers now. This will not go long. I order from zomato nd they missed my item when i tried to reach chat support,the chat support is pathetic if u are looking for help you will not get dont try even.So at the end of the u will look like fool after ordering from here.Because concerns are not taken seriously here.",1
"It's the worst app ever, I don't know why but the app doesn't show any non-veg option in menu of any restraunt, I complained about this but none of their agent took my problem seriously. I am really pissed with this app.",1
Worse customer service. No body is responding at the customer table.. Order got automatically canceled and than again got confirmed after an hour or so. Since the payment was already done I couldn't do anything and the customer representative were seems busy eating to make any response whatsoever,1
It's impossible to get your money back if your order is canceled by chance. No customer care number is there to contact. You will have chat in the zomato app to complain but just a waist of time.,1
Ultimately fantastic app for foodiies,5
Stupidest Customer service! I have been charged a cancellation fee for an order that the restaurant did not even accept. I have been explaining my concern to different CREs each time and they all give me the same reply that due to change in policies cancellation charges would be levied upon cancellation post order acceptance by the restaurant. Have even shared my screenshot before my order got cancelled that clearly states I would get a full refund as my order wasn't accepted by the restaurant.,1
"Basically Zomato is pathetic place. They take payment, accept order, message you that your foos is being prepared and then decline your order saying the restaurant is not open today! Don't ever ask me to trust you again. If you can send me false messages about my order being accepted by restaurant and my is food being prepared, I dont think you tell the truth about anything.",1
very fast and convenient.. very easy to order food with this App.. lot of good offers are also available in Zomato. I had a bad experince with my last Order.. but it was the mistake from the restaurant.. and zomato gave full refund even thought its was not their mistake..,5
They don't even except orders most of the time. What am I even supposed to do with app.,1
"I am not able to use my Zomato apps, from the moment I purchased Zomato Gold. Even if my GPS and Internet is working absolutely fine, Zomato app is not able to detect my location and hence I cannot use Zomato services. I have tried to login in multiple devices with the same account, be it a mobile device or a computer. The problem persists everywhere kindly help.",1
"love the app and services from zamato. They are responsive, delivery is fast and the most important thing is ""they care for customers"". Keep up the good work!!",5
I have placed my order once but due to their app technical issue there was debited twice payment. After that I tried to contact for help there is no customer care no. They have only app chat and there they ignore their customers talk. Worst food app service,1
"The delivery service is pathetic, the chat service is hoax, and the refund process is slow as a turtle. My recommendation is that please don't download this app rather look for another alternatives.",1
"Useless service, rude customer service, if your order is cancelled then you will not get your refund, if you will contact customer care they will say you that your fault not ours. And i didn't get my refund so many times don't go for it go for swiggy its so far good from this.",1
Bad experience. Ordere and waited almost one hour. Then i called and got know that order is cancelled and not reflected the same in app. After this they have given ₹24 voucher for this incident. Kind of insulting me. Just thinking abt UBER EATS is there. Their delivery was fast and good customer policies.,1
Whenever there is offer.. Your app doesn't work. If you don't have the server capacity then why you publicise such offers??? This only create problems for the regular customers and even regular customers don't get any offers. Such a third class server and service.,1
"Worst app. I kept on searching restaurants, late night but even restaurants open till 4 am, had switched off taking orders. If this is really the case then zomato must regulate the process and only show restaurants actually open, rather than wasting our time!",1
i tried ordering food. payment was done money was deducted but no order was placed. And your customer service is ridiculous. I waited for more than 40 minutes and still didn't get any response,1
"well not satisfied with their services, silly excuses(like bike puncture) for not delivering food that too after a long period of making the order,rude behaviour of the delivery boys and they ask for the rating before giving you the delivery, then comes the refund issuses and when you try to talk with them every time they say refund has been initiated by our end, check with your bank. are you guys trying to tell me my bank not accepting my money??",1
very bad experience... they r not helpful.... i was having issue with the order trying to cancel that... but they r giving only 1min for cancellation... My order was not updated in chat option... & after 2min they were not at all ready to accept my cancellation request...,1
"Pathetic Customer service ....App is good and fine only as long as there is no human interaction...The moment you reach out to the customer care , all the arrogance come out ...Never ever make the mistake of linking your wallets , be it PayTm or MobiKwik ....The glitches in the app deduct the amount directly from the wallet without your authorization",1
The waste kind of support. They told me tgat your order has been canceled and will be delivered within 4-5 days so again i ordered the same issue came. Then i preferred to use swiggy and atlast what came is surprise both zomato and swiggy came to doorstep they o accepted swiggy one. They don't hava proper desk support uninstalling it,1
"Excellent service, easy to use this app.much more help full....and I like d GPS tracking system with that we can see at what time d order will come n where it is exactly.the main thing is I like d order status it shows clearly. THANK U SO MUCH ZOMATO...",5
I had placed my order & my money was deducted but the application got stuck & i had to place the order again. I was told that my amount would be refunded in 7 working days. But it did not happen months have passed.,1
shows closed restaurants and items not available.takes 20 30 mins to tell that it is not available...call centre wont answer anyding they just tell we will forward to concerned department... after 2 months also same problem...chat support is worst...had to channge rating from 2 star to 1 star...that is the performance,1
Absolutely unprofessional n disgraceful food app....left my entire family hungry n helpless...did not deliver a prepaid 1300 rs order n no1 replied or even bothered to inform or even help us wid food or the prepaid money order we did...its a DISGRACE for a food app...might as well go n pick ur orders urself as ZOMATO hardly cares abt customers after u pay dem the money!!! #loots!! mental harrasment n humilation!! 1 hrs n 30 minutes n waiting...no food n no information frm zomato!!,1
not happy. selection was restricted to only one item at a time. address traced was wrong inspite of sharing the live location. no one checked the address given along with the landmark and called my relative in mumbai. it was shocking and embarrassing. The delivery boy was decent and apologized. service delayed by 25 minutes 🙁,2
"Dear Zomato, Can you please explain why are the menus on your app/site show the inflated prices than what the actual prices are? This is a blatant breech of trust that we as a customer put on you. You already charge delivery fees then why this discrepancy? Sole reason why I haven't used zomato despite their 'offers' in recent times nor have I renewed my gold prescription. You used to be great , but since i noticed this I felt cheated. Seeking the explanation. Sincerely, Disappointed Customer",1
gud app but i dnt understand y does the tracking system never works ....all d time the delivery boy is standing at d restaurant only....n y is it that the delivery boy has to reach the destiantion only at the exact delivery minute ....the person is waiting near d destination n just waiting for the time to b over,1
I usually don't change my review from app which I am using from long time.App has some issue recent my order with them has changed my view. This company is having worst service. Not helpful. People support arent helpful. Its time use a different app.i was using this app from more then 4 years. All these reviews from other user proves that they have downgraded the level of there service. If there was option to share screenshot of the conversation with support would change mind of all the users.,1
I ordered thrice in this app and three times already git canceled. It was online payment which is prepayment. yeah as soon as the order got canceled i got notification that refund initiated and all but still now i didnt get the refund i contacted to the customer care they said the same but still now i didnt get it its about 1300+ rupees if i didnt get a response i will move legally against the app,1
Very bad experience. I have order biryani and in app it showing delievery in 45 min but after the order delievry change from 45 min to 90 min. I asked to cancel but they simply saying we cant cancel this order ask seller to cancel. Seller saying we can't cancel. service is also very poor and very slow response. From the chat service look like they give value to seller not to customer. Earlier service was good but now it is worst.,1
"It's better not to use this app. As they will first take the amount, then make you wait for long and then cancel the order and will again make you wait for money for so long. And in return costumer will be fooled",1
"When we try to chat for issues, they could not solve, in my case i ordered one biriyani, almost one hour i have not recieved my order, and the delivery boy location is showing one place it self, i try to chat with zomato they are not giving any proper reply and avoiding.. Seriously i am going to delete this app and i will never install this",1
Totally disappointed with the service... Ordered it and they claimed 27 minutes while the restaurant is just 5 minutes away from my home... After half an hour when called the restaurant they didn't find the KOT.. and Zomato said after half an hour that there will be delay in your order... Disgusting indeed..,1
"The usability is the worst. It used to have a map navigation to find places based on your location and ever since this was removed, one keeps lost trying to use the app and search places based on location and other variables. Please return the map based search.",1
good app.. providing food from your fav resturants at the home. but the worst thing is their delivery boys. Sometimes they speak very rudely. They should not offer services from the resturants which r inconvenient to their delivery boys.,4
I have been a very regular customer of zomato for a very long time I usually order at least 2 times a day But from last few months zomato has slowly raised prices of all food items raised delivery charged added surge fees distance fees and also reduced coupon codes now its very rare to find coupons at all plus price in zomato is significantly more expensive than restaurants. People don't be fooled and loose money go and order from restaurants its a lot cheaper trust me you will save lot of money,1
good app. delievery time has been improved and thats a good thing. also assistance is very helpful but sometimes waiting time on chat assistance is more and that makes it annoying..just sometimes. otherwise its a good experience overall. thank you and keep up the good work.,4
"I tried yo cancel my order just now. Tried 5-6 times. The app always says, we have a high inflow of orders Thanks a lot. Have those high inflow served. Just for the information.. I have been using this app for more than 1 and a half year. Awful.",1
Had a very bad experience. Worst delivery person who behaved rude and worst Customer care service who didn't provide any solution. I wish the technical team can improve their location service and not harass the customers through the delivery persons who move to some other locations and accuse the customer of providing a wrong location. I mean how is this even possible when the customer has been always ordering on the same address every time.,1
Please read other reviews also... U will know I ait making this up Uber had really great offers Food mafia.. Never deliveres on time.. Have never been updated.. if there were multiple delivery.. U have to freaking wait as the time crosses past your delivery time Most of the combo offers can be misleading... I bet you will regret it.. Charges 180 for something that's worth 70 bucks The customer support... I don't even want to talk about it... Bunch of wannabes who managed to score big...,1
"using "" current location"" is sometimes inaccurate, it's keeping on the same location or city as my house even when I'm like in a totally different place that is too far to be in a range.",2
It's th worst experience I have ever had with food delivery app. There is a total disconnect btwn wht the restaurant says nd the Zomato executives. My food has been delayed for more than an hour and it's not here till now. The executiv is unreachbl on his phone. This sucks,1
"My experience with zomato is very bitter. Restaurant cancels orders even after accepting and zomato don't do anything. You don't monitor the orders at your end. Then why are you taking delivery charges? Regarding ZomatoGold package, I was told that 1+1 offers would be there for both dine in and delivery. But till date I did not get any 1+1 offer for online order. This is one kind of cheating/fraud only. You're following what you had offered while promoting zomato gold package.",1
going to uninstall I made a order to domino's and the outlet is hardly 15 min away. they accepted the order I made the payment and then the delivery boy said he can not deliver to my location. what is the use of this application if we can use it planned a day accordingly. 😠.now they are saying money will be returned in a week. are you serious!!!!!!! don't I put my location first then only made the order.,1
Your app is the worst app amongst all food delivery apps.I am saying this because there is a reason behind this.Last time I ordered from your app and your delivery service is so lame that your valet delivered a different order to me instead of my order and i also didn't get my money refunded.That is why I not happy with your delivery.Improve your delivery service and address your valets to just be sincere about their work .,1
Little Disappointed!!! Why don't provide the details of a food's original images because i ordered something but the hotel delivered totally different item . Then i realized the name of a food is same but item could be different one hotel by another hotel.,3
Very good app. But theirs hotels food quality(taste) is not much good in packaging but when you go to same resturant to eat you can get diffrent taste. But zomato should give extra offers or reduce the tax or vehicle charge .for getting more order i guess,4
"First of all there was payment issue with my order that no executive could solve. Secondly, I received food that was extremely inadequate in quantity and was not even taped or sealed properly. I'm utterly disappointed with these service!",1
Direct order and Zomato order has difference qty as well as value. If you restaurant no. Suggestion call directly. No sealing process on ordered item. Item delivery is going on with normal boxes without sealing. This is the situation under gold membership.,1
"Worst app for food delivery. The promised time is a joke. No timely delivery, pathetic customer support and irritating unprofessional delivery executives are usual things for them. I tried to give them a lot of chances but every time they never failed to disappoint me",1
"I opted for on time delivery or free,, i was waiting on my exact location outdoors to receive my order but delivery partner was late.& All of sudden a message flashed that i am not eligible for refund because my location was not accurate on map. Zomato is cheating us .",1
Very bad customer service. ordered food and order was cancelled by delivery person and fulll money charged no refund and in another case money deducted and order was not placed and there customer support team is just sending common messages about policy and no one is available in chat room worst experience. issue resolved later. thanks zomato,5
"very poor customer support. order today amount deducted from card & order shows payment incomplete error. when contact customer support, shows waiting time 9 min & after that shows error server problem. still dont get any solution. please be careful before ordering.",1
Worst experience... Delivery boy was stuck somewhere and they even can't assign other person to deliver the order .... Waste time on chat and don't even have other communication source which is frustrating at high level.......i received my order after 3 hours and till that time they were argue with me that its not there problem ...... Waste time.....,1
"This is something not acceptable the zomato has started doing fraud . It was only yesterday that I was cancelling my order due to extra delivery time than it was mentioned and on the app's chat server it was showing that there will be no cancellation charges on the order , so I cancelled . But then the unexpected thing happened ,there was no cancellation charge ahh but the whole amount was taken as a penalty by the zomato . That's something great . Didn't expect this from zomato😔.",1
Its the worst food delivery app I have ever used. I am putting this review after third repeated incident that the food delivery boy either says he has delivered the food or dneys to deliver the food after accepting it. This leaves me with no option butoney going in wate and me slepping with empty stomach.,1
-Good- - Gets you food delivered from nearby restaurants -Bad- - Zomato Gold - I got sub standard dishes once I informed restaurant that I have Zomato Gold and I intend to use it. -Ugly- - Unreliable food delivery even with zomato tracking. Order before 8pm for dinner or forget it. Especially bad during weekends. - Non existent customer care. You cannot call customer support of Zomato. Also the chat support is just generic messages by bot and insanely difficult to get to a human to help you.,2
"I alwayz use zomato to order food where ever i used to go. On august 10th I ordered through zomato and i received a wrong item. When i contact your customer care they said it will get resolved within 24 hours and its already a week passed still nothing from your end. I pay for food and its my wish to eat what i like to eat, I dont pay to eat for what you guys misplace my order. Swiggy is much better than your service. Never gona use zomato again .",1
"Poor service, bad experience with regards to online payment and refund. I made the online payment and merchant cancelled the order and upon contacting customer care they informed me that it will take 6-7 working days for refund. Waste of time.",1
"Absolutely horrendous coverage in some areas. Worst during rainy weather. Chat support is ridiculous. Also, for some weird reason some decent outlets serving good food have low ratings. No wonder rival food delivery services are killing it.",2
These people can not take the correct location. if you are in a new city be prepared to get your orders cancelled. twice my order got cancelled and all they can do is initiate a refund. switch to swiggy or uber eats adding to my previous review. now they have started another unscrupulous practice. discounted delivery charges. whereas if you order from the restaurant the delivery is free. their chat support is the worst ever. they have predefined responses which they recite like a parrot,1
It gets u to order food that cant be delivered as the restaurant has already closed. And on top of that it gets to keep ur money as one has to accept order after 2 hours of waiting or just surrender the money as the customer isnt patient enough. Best app for getting looted.,1
It sad to know ubereats got sold to zomato.. there was zero comparison with zomato because uber was way more cheaper and really had unbelievable discounts which i even combime both zomato and swiggy so called offers whould be less. I really miss that app and the relativity it had. Both the most important point here there why zomato didn't yet have such discounts and why it charges delivery charges and so charges don't know what are they for????,1
"Its an amazing app. But sometimes food quality bothers me and i have no other option apart from throwing it (rotten or smell comes from food) and i cant do anything else. Except from this, this app is the best i can get.",5
The veg. Biryani was so tasty . Its taste was amazing . The dilevery was in 20 minutes . This app is so fast.,5
"😡😡😡🤢🤢🤢....PLS COOK YOUR OWN FOOD..ZOMATO SERVES UNHEALTHY FOOD AT VERY HIGH PRICE...THE FEEDBACK PROVIDED TO RESTAURANTS ARE DELETED BY THE HOTEL MANAGEMENT...HOTELS ARE DISPLAYING FOOD PRICES WITH 30% INCREASE IN PRICE AND ZOMATO STEALS YOUR MONEY BY SHOWING ""OUR RIDERS ARE IN HUGE DEMAND ,PLS ORDER MORE""....I REQUEST PEOPLE NOT TO USE ZOMATO🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 ...",1
this is the worse experience in Zomato. no proper way of communication. the people who is responsible to handle the chats are not capable enough to provide proper information. neither the custom care number is not provided in app nor there is any way to the direct contact with the agent of Zomato. the email ID does not even work. I tried so many times to send mail but the mail is not working. I have never seen such apps who renders this much poor services to its customer.,1
Don't connect to low quality firms. Faced poor service.,1
"The experience is awesome. Always helps when in need of food, in case of emergencies. The food quality is good. The track is also provided all g with delivery boy's name and phone no.",4
Very bad customer support. No reply on chat service for 40 minutes now. No number mentioned to call customer helpline Update: chat support no longer available despite troubleshooting. Service has degraded further and I didn't know that was possible,1
There are glitches like before order cancellation it was written that there won't be any charges but later my money was not refunded. The delivery person are dumb and rude as well which lead mr to cancel the order as he wasn't able to find the location.,1
"I went yesterday with my friends.the food was ok.service was fast.Pathetic part was the guys on service were very rude.Before finishing food,in between they were asking to collect the soiled dishes,seemed like they were cutlery shortage. Very unfriendly staff.Even the manager got rude when we asked to adjust the table for kids to sit comfortably. Very bad service",2
worst customer support service they have. There was a missing item in my order and its already been 4 days i haven't received any refund. I am talking to their agents on a daily basis to get my money back and they are doing nothing but just giving false assurance and asking me to wait and have patience.,1
"Today again I had same pathetic experience at Zomato. ordered a cake and a comolimetary item. Did not get the item. complained to zomato and they say sorry we can not do anything. I think Swiggy and Foodpanda are far better. At zomato, Once you have placed order, they will not listen to you. Their customer care executives are like robots who will say only two things - sorry sir, and we will improve later on which never happens. They do not listen to customers.",1
Although its a good experience with zomato but from few days i am facing a problem with the app. whenever i go for live location it didnot pic and show something went wrong try again. i have uninstalled the app and then again i downloaded it but in vain. please help.,5
What a waste this app is.. something went wrong error all the time...I think so it is only for the first time users so that they dont have to give the fake discounts that they had shown in the advertisements..,5
"Easy to find out deals and offers. Browsing restaurants and getting to know the menu is very user friendly. Zomato is super focused on customers and the experience they should have. You'll are doing a fabulous job! Thanks you, Zomato!",5
"What happened to the notifications? Previously we got notification when orders were accepted, on their way, and had reached it's location, what happened to all those? Please ensure we get notifications with the next update.. We miss the Zooooommm!",2
This app is the best option to get food delivered on time. Food lovers like me would love to use this app. Must in every mobile. User interface and accessibility is excellent. Zomato has always delivered my order on time. Thanks to the Team. Kudos!!! Best Wishes 👍🏻,5
"Its customer support is very very very poor and pathetic. They don't have call support so customer can't call and describe his/ her issue. They allow chat only. They are expecting that the customer who faced some issue in his lunch or dinner delivery, vl connect them via chat and describe.!!!!!! What a great logic. Their customer executives keep you waiting for more than 25 mins without your consent or prior notice.",1
"Good service, on time delivery. In app reviews are pretty genuine and helpful while trying out a new outlet. Only issue I faced so far is that some times it shows that a particular outlet is not accepting orders but my friend sitting beside me is able to place order.",4
It was my first and favourite food ordering app but now the user interface and paying system become is so irritating and paying system have some issues it is not working properly. Now I am uninstalling and give 1 star. See when customer is hungry they want simple and fast app don't make customer frustrated,1
"Very delicious, but packing is not good",4
"App is good, the service provided is also pretty nice. The problem is with the customer care. They don't even have a proper customer care service. The chat system is plain stupid. Your problems will never be resolved here.",1
worst. customer experience i have been promised for the refund as i didnt get my order .after paying i m continuesly contacting from past on week but they till 3 days said they have initiated and it will be credited in your paytm wallet soon and today i contacted about refund and they are telling that they have refunded and amount has been credited in my bank account as i have paid through paytm how they got my bank details to refund .this people are just fooling worst and a pathetic service.,1
"have order morning breakfast, it seems it will reach in afternoon. rider says that how I can detect your location in entire Gurgaon.. customer support saying that your location is incorrect and hang up phone by saying thanks without listening to me. and I am still waiting for my breakfast.. now rider says I will not come.",1
"Very bad experience with Zomato.. Friend's go with Swiggy They always value theare customer and care for money.. I use both.. Some time get very poor food from both. Swiggy always try to gave some kind of refund. But Zomato they don't care.. They don't have c.care team.. They reply like this.. ""Please be assured that feedback has been shared with the restaurant partner about the food they've delivered. Our efforts will surely be emphasised on providing you with a better experience next time. """,1
Now they are charging more and offering no discounts either.In my opinion its better to use restaurants own home delivery.,1
"Excellent app, but one thing is the person who don't know how to order they will drink 3 Rivers of water for ordering, I also tried several times at last I ordered perfectly. That is the reason to reduse 1 star",4
provide some rectification option after ordering the food. it is nt good to charge for the cancellation order....if somebody mistakenly order the item n afterwards they want to change the item...then u should provide some option for changing the order ....very disappointed 😒😒,1
"I had ordered my food at 6.30 pm and I had a call from restaurant that the order was ready at 6.45pm but no one is here to pick your order from zomato then I do chat with customer care he just copy pasting his templates but I didn't have any solution and finally they cancelled at 8.00pm and saying that refund will be processed only after 5-7 days, even I have never heard such worst service before, worst zomato and also it's delivery boys. Don't irritate those who are really hungry man.",1
your services are not good as i think i don't know the exact status of my order sometimes restaurant contact number is not reachable and sometimes you delivery boy number is not reachable and when i chat with your team they take a lot of time to reply you tell me if a person is hungry so he wait for your food for more then one hour for delivery.,1
"Just now my order got cancelled, apparently without any of my fault. As per you my number was unresponsive and so you cancelled my order and can't refund me. Well first: I was online and reachable. And second the service guy didn't even ring the doorbell. Also As soon as it got cancelled I contacted chat support to provide the number of the service guy so i can contact him. But well you guys started blaming me. After countless orders and debates why zomato was better, You guys disappointed!!",1
have had a few instances where the correct address was not communicated to the restaurant. otherwise it's a good app. great offers. i really like the lists as well.,4
"cancellation is not available. i have requested the restaurant to cancel my order, but they are refusing to cancel and forcing me to take or get the penalty chatges though i immediately requested for cancellation which is a very bad experience.",1
Best food quality,4
"I installed the app. At my first order l cancelled due to a phone call from the bakery and said ""we don't have that item"". Now always when l order the food it includes the cancellation fee of the previous order.",1
"This whole app is rigged. I'm a gold member and whenever I open reviews of any restaurant, it only shows the good ones and makes a fool out of you. It's only when you dig deeper and open all reviews you'll find bad reviews being buried under the good ones. A lot of times a place with horrible reviews is presented as the best one out there just because the review tab takes you to it's best reviews and not its latest. THAT'S CALLED BEING A CHEAP CHEAT. YOU HAVE NO ETHICS AS A COMPANY.",1
customer support doesn't respond on time and if we make a short delay in response they will close the ticket. I raised a concern of spoiled food which was not in a condition to eat and they wants the snapshot of the food which I thrown to dustbin.,2
"it has failed to deliver orders twice in a month for the same customer and you are making customers wait till 1 hour on online chat support, no availability of support executive for one hour(never seen such in any customer service) Ridiculously not liking this app.",1
"At first i had a great experience with Zomato but now with every passing day Zomato is getting worse than before. As I'm a regular foodie, i would recommend Zomato to buck up and get back on track. Wish I could give less than 1 star. This my 2nd review and I am uninstalling Zomato now forever",1
really nice. have ordered food. easy to use. Order values of lower amount are also accepted.another app I was trying to order from dominos but they always said that below 300 the order is not accepted but in Zomato it is accepted.,4
Really bad experience.. I have ordered food.. It was bad.. I asked for refund... But still i have not got the refund.. Secondly...today i was ordering food.. I guess the app was down or what.. My money has been transferred to zomato.. But no order has been placed... Waste service by zomato... They dont deserve even 1 star,1
i have been using zomato for quite a long time before i just deleted it for forever. they show offers and all however they send you stale food. i agree it might be the restaurants problem however when i contact the support for the same i get mistreated as a customer. i too work at customer support but i never knew that they behave so bad and dont help and get paid for nothing. But i gotta trust them without any follow ups and updates and proofs for my problem. i hate this app.,2
"Don't use it. I got a very bad experience not only once, twice. Got incomplete order two times and even they don't have any courtesy towards the customer. I won't suggest this to anybody. Got a very bad experience with this.",1
They don't even deserve single star. Below are the reasons. Delivery guys eat food to be delivered They charge lot of charges like below to deliver Delivery fee Packing charges Surge fee(all the day) Distance fee Taxes Thee Zomato chat is also not that good to use if you have any order related issue Also your mobile no is no longer safe. You gets lots of messages from restaurants which you previously ordered,1
I had to wait for one hour and a half to recieve my meal eventhough the resturant is 5 minutes away from me. And when I contacted customer support they said I just have to wait one hour and a half!!!!!,1
I have ordered some food from some restaurent and i got my some item missing. When i called the restaurent they said they dnt have rider and they cant send the missing order. Then i used zomato support to complain they as usual in starting said they will reply in 24 to 48 hrs and when they replyed they said they feel very regreted and this will not happen again. What the hell i have always trusted zomato and also been the gold member. Now i am uninstalling the app. VERY DISAPPOINTED.,1
Best app for foodie lovers like me,5
"Very much disappointed with zomato chat support! Dont know if it is a fault in app or the chat support personel, that after a long long wait i got a response that too only with a ""hi"" Also they closed the chat very rudely without asking even the issue us resolved or not!",2
"I placed an order & paid for also the amount got deducted but still no responce from the resturant & no confermation from your side also.. And on the top of that your customer support is such a pain. If someone is needing something urgent,the person will Die but wont get reply from your side",2
I really wonder why they do not provide Cash on Delivery option over a particular amount. Its pathetic and frustrating.,1
It was totally disappointing. They accepted the order ..and after an hour their delivery boy said the location is quite far so I can't deliver it.. please cancel the order. My mom and sister wasn't feeling well at that moment and i had to order food for them,1
"😡 I have very bad experience with Zomato☠👹👺. Please do not use this app. They are fraud. I did not receive my food order which was delivery service. When their delivery boy couldn't deliver, they skipped my order & replied wrongly that your order selected as pick up service, so you go to the restaurant & collect your food order. When I requested them to cancel the order, Zomato couldn't even cancel my order & did not refund my money. Finally I did not receive my order.",1
"Zomato has zero customer service in case food quality issue is there. They will basically blame the restaurant and refuse to do anything further. Even in case of rotten, spoilt or inedible food. Basically no food quality and hygiene accountability. Don't even give basic refund. Online customer service gives automated response and refuse to do anything except say sorry this will not happen again bla bla. Warning all other customers that dont expect zomato to do anything for you if things go wrong",2
"prompt delivery, very good selection of restaurants. very easy to order. we usually order thrice in a week and every time we found prompt delivery staff behavior is veey good. we can track online easily.",5
chipper than others app like swiggy. Delivery executive behaviour also good. but one thing I feel that delivery executives app assistant is not good enough. They found some struggle to find address. overall experience is awesome.,5
Really am not happy from this app. Due to payment condition.Am just apply promo code on my first order its show successfuly on my order but i paid full payment due to lack of full information not show on this app..its my first and last order on this app..its worth aap according to me..plz anyone dont use this up.i give rate for this app 0 thanks,1
There was some confusion with the address and the zomato person cancelled my order. I'm trying to reach out to support but it's not working.The address that I've put was correct but the app picked the wrong area. I didn't get the refund.,1
Good and polite,4
on 15 th i have ordered food at 0816 . delivery time was 0917 . After 0945 when i have contacted resturant they said they require one more hour.nobody was there in zomato chat support to help Tried several times lasltly brought food from local shop.zomato should clearly say that food can not be delivered well in advance. chat support is horrible,2
ever since the update the app does not give correct rating of the restaurant and service. at some instance the hotel info is not even shown. delivery section we are not able to go to the reviews. delivery section hotel menu is not directly accessible in case you want to see a pic before ordering,3
"worst app ever whenever i try to order meals it always show that the restaurants aren't accepting order and when i order smthg like snacks etc, suddenly all restaurants are accepting orders. I don't even want to give a single star to this app but it won't be post until we give star to this stupid app",1
"Instead of paying online and the food sent by the restaurant, how can the delivery boy say that he can't deliver the food when he is just few minutes away from the destination. On top of that we pay the tip, the delivery charges and the food cost and still we have to buy our head. After talking so much with customer care and the delivery boy he reached in 2 mins...how was it possible? Please give proper service when we pay without any disturbance and hitchkitch...",2
Zomato has very poor customer service. zomato provides only contact number of the restaurant in their app to contact regarding issue with food or delivery. Zomato does not provide any contact number to complain if there is an issue with their delivery or the delivery boy. I recived a pizza where the toppings were completely smudged to the corner of the box. The delivery boy sprang away saying that it was rhe fault of the restaurant. Zomato was not reachable to call and complain for the issue.,1
personally my vision is that zomato has a deal with the restaurants to provide different type(quality) of food to the customers which are not good as well. the taste is also different. i visit the restaurant & feel the quality but when order the same food on zomato i found the difference. therefore only 1 star.,1
Won't order from zomato again. Sent my food to the wrong pinned address (even though the address typed and told over the phone was correct). Didn't get any refund also had to wait for more than one hour for food. Horrible customer support.,1
"Horrible, it doesn't open as expected and keeps asking for location despite logging in and slecting the correct address. Everytime I open the app, it struggles to open and throws an error that something is wrong.",1
"DO NOT DOWNLOAD! This app is getting intolerable day by day. Highly rated, priced restaurants are delivering SUBSTANDARD, STALE food, delivery guys refuse delivery because he wishes so, food is delivered spilled despite their 'safely sealed' gimmick, cooking instructions are not being followed. And they reply ""we'll take strict action against this"", ""looking into the matter"". The agents are not connected for around 10 mins and are to reply with computer generated message ""were we helpful?"".",1
Pathetic app with no customer support. Only chat bot replies. Payment deducted but no delivery. Waste of time and money. Ruined my entire party. Not to mention that orders will ALWAYS have missing items.,1
"you are tired, late, busy, lots of friends coming over or whatever the situation, just sit back nd relax .. Zomato is their",4
"App is good but frustrated totally with my first order. After waiting for 40 minutes when I called the delivery boy, he said your order is cancelled as we cannot deliver beyond the limit of 8 kms. Totally embarrassing.",1
"I believed in zomato but this time i really feel this is worst app ever. I ordered 5 Domino's Pizza and did the online payment, but i didnt received my order even after 2 hrs. Then again i ordered new 4 pizzas and again same happened. I just cant explain how worst the feeling was as all my friends were hungry and were waiting for almost 3 and half hour. My friends wanted me to give very bad words to zomato as well as to dominos but I thought giving bad words will not be the solution. Be aware...",1
Worst service. Never ever use this for online ordering. I neither received food nor money back. They don't have any customer service. You have chat them for queries to which they don't respond at all. Worst experience. Useless app,1
Ridiculous app .. Yesterday i ordered pizza from zomato (domino's). I paid with UPI then i got a message that my order get cancelled. I thought i will get my money.. I talk to customer care staff they told me to mail to zomato i did that too but still i do not get my money from zomato . Poor service poor management.,1
"Though the restaurant options are quite high as compared to other apps, delivery charges and other hidden charges are extremely high. Uber Eats only charged ₹20 irrespective of distance and was providing quick delivery service amongst all in Navi Mumbai area.",3
Best service and good food,5
"The app UI, UX, even the service are good but the location it shows is not at all precise. Everytime, delivery valet person has to be explained with detailed address. Swiggy is more precise in it. Please rectify.",4
Very worst customer support.. when the order was placed and money was deducted from account.. but they say payment was failure..it will be credited to the account 4 to 5 days.. we peoples are just waiting for the food.. they didn't send any kind of intimation to us..,1
"I ordered food, forgot to change my old number. Paid money by Google pay, new address was updated. I got notification that Delivery boy came till my doorstep and went back. He did not come at all. As my number was not updated, he called on old number. Later I chatted with customer service team, they said it's my fault, money won't be refunded back now. I told them this is my first order on zomato, i usually order on swiggy n they never call, money is paid online, address is updated, they send it",1
"Have ordered many times &has been delivered also properly. It is very useful as comes in handy when guests r there. Also, if I don't like to travel but wanna eat from some other place,it is very useful.",5
It was good at first days nd now just it's a big problem it is not taking promotions always saying something went wrong try later . As i ve promotion nd i have not used it nd it also has not expired then what's the problem !!😡 My pickup code is not working. HORRIBLE😡😤,1
"very bad experience, today have placed pre paid order but partially order delivered, am trying from last one hour but no one responding on chat box.i don't know whether i get refund or not. even they have no customer care number. so be careful when you place order in Zomato.",1
once i was disappointed with its services as it was unable to reach to me to deliver because i was not able to attend call they should deliver to location provided but they didn't i was waiting and they didn't have cancel and refund policy I do not like that one mainly i didn't get money but order was cancelled by restorant,3
This app is pathetically slow! Even after the update. It fails again and again at transaction page. Today money was deductted twice but order was not placed. I guess there are better apps around then this.,1
I have been ordering since long time and very often. I loved using this app than other apps. This app is so user friendly as well as it always gives me discount. Overall experience is amazing. Thank you zomato,5
"The gold benefits is totally non beneficial for people depending on delivery. It destroys restaurant's own discount which makes the meals more expensive. Eg. A cake of price Rs 500 which the restaurant is providing for Rs 300. If I order two cakes normally - Total cost is Rs 600 If I order two cakes with GOLD BENEFITS - Total cost is Rs 700. Hence, ye saare (Zomato) milke hame pagal bana rhe h.",1
"Ordered The food it Was total blunder, the quantity and quality both were compromised, I tried to solve the issue by chat support and it just selected few of the items only and refund amount was chosen randomly... The food was total waste for me",1
"Well planned robbery when they pretend to 'serve' people in tough times Neither takes the responsibility to deliver the right product not takes the effort to replace it, just forces to accept the wrong delivery, with the delivery valet and chat support staff saying different things to annoy the customer, all this is done when it's sure people can't get them replaced on their own due to government orders which has locked people in their homes.",1
"This is the worst service provider i say.. I felt really bad experience a couple of times. They chatged me unnecessarily. Though i cancelled the order after 2 mnts i placed, didn't get the refund.. And the supporting system is also not good. I will never ever use this aap from now. ZOMATO - thank you for all the bad experiences.",1
zomato was good initially but now it is getting worse... if anyone is looking for a good online ordering app then this is not the one. getting wrong orders from the vendor is a common problem but this guys don't handle properly and moreover they promise u some credita but will give u less credits instead... worst online food ordering experience with Zomato.,1
One of the worst food service providers out there. They do not know how to make services easy for the customer rather they have all the points in making a customer's life hell. It takes about a month for them to give the customer a refund for their own fault of putting restaurants even when they are not available. I would not reccomend anybody to order from zomato. Worst app ever. If there were any negative stars I would give an infinite negative. Extremely BAD,1
"It has become a necessity in our busy schedules. Order from any place and you can enjoy it any other place.Sometimes kids call and ask for some snack from any particular shop they willing to have. I do order from office and enjoy the food delivered at home, with my family.",5
"Updated version of the app is fantastic.it has enabled to book tables and also can know the price and menu.includes all info abt the restaurant.Great service, great offers, discounts, coupons, ontym delivery,useful chat support .thank u .",5
"Not able to go to my profile in new design, my phone's right side upper corner not working, please change the design or allow the horizontal view of app, (not able to buy new mobile now). When i buy new mobile I'll inform you, that time design your app whatever you want! But for now, please it's my request to you that change the design. Thank you! Lots of love",3
"this app is very usefull. first when I downloaded it i did not think it will be match with my think!! but, when I ordered some food there was very less prices of food. like: if I buy some food at shops... shops were costly to get expensive food. but zomato gives me very less prices of food. hot & yummy😊😊 but now I'm satisfied with this app.",5
"Worst app for food delivery you can ever have. They didn't respond on time on zomato chat. And if you order something at midnight from zomato, the delivery person unnecessarily cancel the order. And when you tell them about the problem on chat support they even don't reply for hours.",1
"Can't order anything for past five days. First the orders kept getting rejected as soon as I placed them. Now I can't even place order because it keeps asking for my address even though I've already saved one, and then it says something went wrong my i try to save the address. Can't get past this to place my order. Really irresponsible from these people.",1
Delivery charges increased and cost of food is also increased....but is fast beyond the imagination..... Quality of food is also bad.... I have tried from most of the restaurant.... Please maintain the quality of food and service and cost,1
"worst customer service, too much delayed in service. if we will do everything than what is the use of the app. app is used so that good services will be provided but day by day services become worst. if we have to do everything than we will direct contact the restaurant what is the use mediator.",1
"Suprb.. don't know about others but we are enjoying. Fantastic app, great service, a beautiful team work. Wish you prosper heigh.. not at all worry to grow old & think whether some one will be available to take care of us at the end or not. Gave up idea to find a suitable ""Old Age Home""... I should always find you next to me!",5
"past 2 days app takes money and doesnt send orders to restaurant, then u have to follow up. today app took money, its almost 90 mins later no order. Disappointed. This app used to work very well, now its faulty.",1
"Mostly I had to stay away from my home, so getting homely food is very hard. But when I can't control the hunger Zomato is the only were go for help, good offers, great choice if restaurants....please remove very low rates restaurants and add new ones, update the new dining areas in all locations",5
this app is good for discount offers but got dispoint with delivery boys and their service... they are asking to like execellet smiley during the time of delivering the food. and some are behaving rude... specially the one who delivered my food today morning.,3
The app sucks. I was unable to track the order. Very poor navigation very disappointed.. I had to call the delivery guy to know the order status. There should be zero star option.,1
"I order food regularly through this app and get it delivered on time. I can find out great food joints through this App and being a zomato gold, get some privilege at the partner restaurants both on home delivery as well as while dining out.",4
Zomato service sucks... The customer support executives don't understand English at all... It's not one person who couldn't understand the issue... They were 4 of them could not understand the issue no matter how many times n wats I have rephrased the issue... Still the issue is not resolved...,1
"It is waste app, it won't give refund for damaged food, please don't use this app. I got totally spilled out food in cover itself how one can eat such type of food. I have asked them for refund, they are not responding for any messages.",1
"Zomato You just embarrassed me in front of my friends and ruined my party. Your site is as slow as tortoise, even it is faster than your site. I was trying to order since 2 hours but it kept showing error.. I am getting off from zomato..",1
first of all i want to tell Zomato that if we are paying 200 for food then we are not hungry for their 30 or 40rs refund which they provide for complaining. if the food is below average then start replacing it or rather start refunding the whole amount else you will loose your customers. there are other applications too which are doing better so please start respecting our complaints or else everyone will start uninstalling your application.,1
It's really a super super super application I really happy with this app☺☺☺😊😊😊👌,5
Had I bad experience with today's order. I placed an incorrect order so immediately within a minute I contacted the zomato support to cancel it. I didn't ask for refund but instead zomato credits. But the support guy ask me to pay cancelation fee of ₹198 which was not logical and refuse to help me. Anyway this was my last order with zomato there are many more app in market with much better deals so I would like to suggest you to improve your customers service.,1
"There must be an address confirmation prompt before placing the order, sometimes people forget to change the address because the last delivery address remains default. So please make some changes on it.",4
"bad service,i have placed address near to my home but they are not ready to get my order on my door step ,they took exactly 1hr20 minutes to deliver and demanded us to collect the order where the location is showing when v refused and canceled my order they told us that v have to pay the comple amount in next order as my order was cash on Delivery,i will never trust zomato again,in my last order also the total bill was around 568 where I got the same think for 510 even the hotel is not 2 far",1
"I used to love zomato.. but day by day your services are falling in all criterias.. Behaviour problems of delivery person, quality of food, response by zomato.. everything has downgraded in quick time... I m Highly unsatisfied still giving 3 stars coz i used to use this app often... 😶",3
It's the best app for ordering food and it's service is great. I have never experienced any bad behaviour of the delivery boyds and has always got my delivery on time and with proper packaging 🙂. As my mumma is ill from past couple of weeks I have been ordering from this app and I always get a good discount and good service by this app. Hope Zomato won't degrade it's good service or stop giving offers. Love from Kolkata 😋♥️♥️,5
Great dealing with Zomato,5
It's the worst experience with customer support... No one replies on mails..i have lost my money on orders due to their inconvenience and they told me that I haven't answered the phone... I have done the payment so that's why they said like this... If I would have been done cod then they can even find my exact address,1
"I had ordered food and after 2+ hours of waiting my order get cancelled as there is no response from the delivery person,his phone was switched off,i tried to contact customer support they said after 2 hours they too unable to reach him and as the reason my order after waiting till 1.30am got cancelled and customer support just said to order again. This is just the worst experience overall for me. Uninstalling this stupid app right away and will never install again and others do so too. Sht app",1
Very badly developed app. After you apply coupon price increases after every click you make. This is i think to fool customer because customer will think we applied coupon and paid but actually coupons are removed automatically if you click any button.,1
"I was a regular user of this app, however today my order got cancelled and i was told that the valet tried to reach me on my number multiple times. I have not received a single call and when i called the valet, he disconnected after hearing my name. My refund was also denied. I have vowed never to order from Zomato again. Unistalled the app aswell.",1
the service they give is worst if your address has some sily mistake or the delivery boy doesn't find your house they cancel the delivery and no refund is given they did same with me and my prepaid order didn't got me back i will not reinstall or make order from now...worst app i ever used don't install this kind of apps,1
All the prices you see is in the online menu already added some extra money to it. Useless offers will be applied to get the same back. How many times should we get cheated by this.,1
Food ordered was not delivered correctly it was spilled and was not eatable. There is not customer care number. Its just the chat option that to its guide by BOT or IVR. When raised compliant with photo the response as thank you and money not refunded.,1
"The zomato chat support replies in 8 min, but when they asked to confirm to transfer the credits as a token of apology, and did not hear from me for just 3 min, they closed the chat and went away. Great work!",1
"the app does not allow cancellation of order and will go round and round until the order is processed and then you have no choice nut to accept order or they force you to pay , even if its the apps shortcomjng....its Zomato way or the highway...Fix it !!",1
"nice app, amazing service but sometimes there is a problem in the payment gateway and the order is not confirmed after an transaction. But, they will return ur money. Rest , a good app.",4
"I love zomato, especially the 40% or 50% discount which is always available, the estimated waiting time is always true, if chat support cud be faster then it wud be really helpful, and I personally feel zomato takes a lot of delivery charges which actually compensates with the discount tht u r getting, but overall I love zomato",4
"order accepted by restaurant but items not available. restaurant people says order auto accepts when no activity from restaurant side, nothing could be done from restaurant side. poor thinking in this prospect of app design need to modify this parameter of app.",1
This app deserves a zero star rating. The service is nothing short of scamming. Charging a full penalty without even telling. I will never use it again. Will recommend my friends to not use this as well.,1
it takes ages to connect to customer service. I complained at 3pm and the customer service executive replied at 5:30pm.Really really bad customer service.it seems zomato doesn't care about their loyal customers there's no partner program like swiggy super for free delivery.... Update: Now you've ruined another good food delivery service uber eats by acquiring it...if you add Rs100 food in cart your total bill is Rs160+? you losers,1
"User friendly and helpful app. One suggestion i have, like you have a 'Veg only' option, can we also have a 'Non Veg only' option.. Date oct 2, 2020 Very disappointing when u cant get a bill generated and there is no response from the customer support email.",3
As per the latest experience. Much appreciate your service,4
"Really unhappy with the service. Restaurant phone number is switched off, Driver is switched off, Zomato Chat is not working and Zomato IVR ends abruptly. No refund expectations but I was hungry when this happened. All in all, not reliable.",1
"very bad app, constant crashing, you end up spending a lot of time with customer support trying to get refund for money deducted over nothing than waiting for your delivery, Talabat is better with excellent customer support.",1
"if you have zomato gold its the only good thing. if you are ordering food then its the worst app. uber and swiggy are better. the dont have an option of sold out. so after you place your order the restaurant accepts and you are waiting for your order , the restaurant is preparing your order , suddenly it says cancelled order. it happened to me twice.",1
"I had placed my order through zomato at pizza hut and we did not receive that order we waited for 2 hrs, we contacted zomato and even pizza hut but still we didn't get our order, this service is very bad and after complaining zomato failed to deliver our order. After such bad experience we are never going to order from this so called zomato app.",1
Too much fluctuations in app... if we open app and find some restaurants before ordering if we go to other app or close zomato app and again when came back we are not able to find the same restaurant it will say as restaurant is not taking online orders again 2 to 3 min same restaurant starts taking orders...,4
"Ordered food based on quickest delivery time less than 30 minutes, it kept changing. The valet started going to different directions probably to cater to multiple deliveries. After a wait of 72 minutes cancelled order. Imagine relying on Zomato till 10.30 pm but having to cook as food is undelivered.",1
"All the coupons displayed on app, are invalid. And unfortunately it never shows the validity concern. You just come to know when bill is raised. Morerover there is no way possible to cancel or change the same.",1
Good food delver app,5
"The app is decent and much better than swiggy. But the live track option is not correct. It never gives correctly location. I get the order, even when the order is showing"" being prepared"". repeat of my review. no major changes despite every week of update. are you guys really reading your reviews?? or just wanted to us to waste our data for useless update...",2
the customer support is very poor and they don't refund the amount to customer even if the order is cancelled because it took long time to confirm from restaurant and then customer need to wait for long time until the restaurant accepts no other option for customer as he pays for that order and shouldn't expect refund for cancellation of order due to longer waiting time.,1
"Your customer support is horrible. I made two orders and a message was displayed 'Error occured'. But I lost the money form my paytm wallet in both cases and the order status still remains on pending. The hotel havent received the order when i inquired by calling them I chatted with zomato chat suppirt and emailed then, yet not even a reply. I need a refund for the same",1
I gave 5 star before. Now these guys service is becoming very worst. They are not following the schedule i ordered pizza by 10.30 its not yet delivered now still i am waiting. Two days back they called me as i was unable to pick the call for 10 min during call they simply ignored and canceled the order and went back i tried to connect with them later. No response from online chat. I slept simply without having food because of this guys. There is no refund policy as well. Worst ever service i had,1
"I mostly order in Dubai. So, this rate is based on Dubai only. UI is good. Service and cooperation is good. But sometimes Address selection through GPS is not so supportive. And delivery ppl get nconfused on that.",3
You can't search for a restaurant without adding a address!! Crappy user experience. Plus if they screw up or delay the order.. the refuse to refund the money and threaten you! Gone to the dogs... Swiggy sometimes seems like the smarter option.,2
The worst app I have ever used.... It takes your order while you are waiting after some time they will call you or inform you that your order has been cancelled due to some technical issues... It has happened thrice with Me...,1
"The complete order had not been delivered to me, I don't know whether it's the delivery man's fault or the restaurant's, but I am really disappointed, and I won't ever use this app's service again. Really disappointed.",1
"Please note that you did not mention in the app that the payment will be cash on delivery, and you mentioned that the amount will be deducted from my visa. I didn't have cash and this is very unprofessional to let your customer face this situation.  PS: I received the order 15 mins late 75mins for several orders from the shops that are 10 mins away and the food was not hot.",1
"I find more food joint options in my neighborhood in other apps like foodpanda, swiggy, etc. Also I have booked few restaurants earlier but I didnt see the Zomato Gold membership benefits extended even though I shared Zomato Gold membership details with restaurants. Also Zomato Support is pathetic. The only option you to contact them is through chat window and one needs to wait for 10-15 mins to get a response. Day by day the online ordering through Zomato App is getting worse.",1
it used to be very good the new User Interface is confusing. the very basic search by map to know the restuarant around you disappeared. too many information all around the application . it used to be much simpler and clean.,1
I wish there was zero stars. Terrible experience. we did an order in zomato and it was already paid. But it was cancelled saying driver was not able to reach the number but until wencalled them we din get any text or call. the cs chat support was so pathetic that they were asking the reason again n againnwhich we had to explain couple of times. and when we emailed them aprt from from auto response no response. Pathetic response and I will never reinstall this app.,1
"Very Bad.... as I found food item missing from my packed/zomato tapped food parcel. just check your food at a time of delivery and make sure that restaurant deliver you full/complete parcel. All food was packed in plastic bags/polithin, which I don't prefer for hygiene and clean environment.",1
Time shown 25 min and order come after 1 hours kindly update your system so no one can become fool,1
"The restaurant was open for online order and hence i ordered online, my order wasnt accepted, i called the the delivery guy and he said he'll reach the place and confirm with me, after 20 mins of ordering the order displayed accepted only to know by the delivery guy that the place is closed and it only showed accepted because he clivked on something, all this took over 45 mins and i am left hungry. moreoer the support wait time shows chat 1 min n i havent received a reply till now past 25 mins",1
"Wish I could give 0 star. The delivery boy goes somewhere else, when the address is clearly mentioned. He cannot reach the added address and so he cancels the order saying phone was not reachable. There is refund for this.",1
This app do not even deserve 1star..I selectd my first meal and without any confirmation it ordered automatically...ok no problem with that...but now im unable to use promo code new50 as im no more new customer as per there worst policy..i prefer u to use other app for ordering meal..,1
"this is the worst experience i have had, i ordered through zomato for the first time. i received stale and rotten chicken! when this was brought up to the customer representative he had the odocity to say he can not refund but can only apologise for the inconvenience caused! this is absolutely the perfect way to con customers. what happens to my money now which i have paid for the stale chicken which has gone straingt into the dustbin!",1
"Zomato is not going to reply you until and unless you had placed a recent order, whether you are a daily customer or not that doesn't matters. To get a reply from these people you always need to place a recent order. Trying to communicate with them through chat support from last 2 days, as 5 days before I was assured to be taken strong step against the rotten food delivered. But since today, there's no response from Zomato support because I haven't made a recent order.",1
zomato sucks!!!! i recently ordered something and suddenly restaurant owner called me told me which you written in instructions its not available so you can cancel and reorder..so i done the same and after i was shocked to heard about that policy..if the order is cancelled you charge whole amount as penalty..matlb m that dumb i paid for nothing..meri galti thi kya ki restaurant ki and dont reply to comment ki..sorrry for inconvenience plese mail us..tum logo ki service cod k layak hai.. 😡😡😡,1
"Pathetic support... no live person to interact with who can actually understand the issue... no cash payment option available... only online payment that means while money is gone if order is not placed successfully... my advise to all, better look for other food delivery options rather than choosing this zomato...",1
"Unable to download also...what is happening guys, what kind service you are providing? Make your team work and this resolve #Support_Kamaraj",1
It's very interesting app and as well as useful,5
"Amazing app to order food without hassle... Also, loved the feature of promo codes that offer huge discounts... Easy to use and user friendly, makes food ordering an altogether simple and quick experience.... Keep it up team 👍",4
"3 stars becoz of late food delivery,the time which you gave that our order will be recieved we didnt get our order on that particular time nd you also not provide cancel opt., if by chance someone place wrong order then he/she feels like some big mistake has happened... i hope you will pay attention..",3
each month 12 offers are given . worth for value . i suggest to use this for bachelors . cheaper of all other apps . customer care supports you much better and rectifies our complaints. Pizza burger offers are poor and bit costly for orfers above 300rs. so it is best for pocket friendly dine,5
GPS is worst. Riders cant even locate the destination and also How come if food is out of stock This app accepts orders and then someone from Zomato calls up and ask us to choose something else... Because after waiting for long you come to know there is no option as food is out of stock. Guys do not use this app.. Worst app,1
My first experience was very poor. Price is usually very high than normal and quality is very less. I talked with support but didn't received any help regarding that. This is how Zomato treats his customers. No more word to say about this service now. Thanks Zomato for serving me that type of food which may cause any health issues.,1
"Dont pay online as when I ordered food of Rs 1200 from a restaurant and paid online,the delivery personal went away from the gate just because he couldn't connect my phone and didn't bother to reach me at the address I added for delivery and cancelled my order...I didn't get my refund back and was treated poorly by zomato & restaurant personal both & my issues weren't answered properly..upon insisting on talking with authorities they said they dont have such policies..they only chat..",1
From last few days I am facing issue with 1. Delivered food will not be in a proper condition 2. Spoiled food 3. Charging extra 4. No proper customer service 5. Late delivery In short Zomato is application which is just to make money from customer without satisfying them.,1
App have the option for self pickup but its not accepting for all restaurants.. You cant choose a self pickup option even if you are present there at restaurant to take your food by self... You have to pay the delivery charge unnecessarily and take it feom the delivery boy...,3
"within one minute i asked for order cancellation, but they refused and said food will waste. within one minute which food prepared.maggi take atleast two minutes. they can taste your food but can't cancel order. with in one minute of placed order.",1
Worst app and services! Whenever I had some issue with my order the customer support is useless. They take forever to respond and have the same automated replies. Most of the time their server is down.,1
Some times it is quite irritating when Zomato delivery boy ask you for rating. Let the customer enjoy their meal. When Zomato team already sent a mail for feedback so why always delivery boy ask for a feed back. We are here to enjoy meal not here to give ratings when you are hungry and not in a mood to do anything else apart of eating.,2
Pathetic App after the latest update. The chat bot is so dumb which is expected looking at the quality of other features. To make matters worse sufficient human intervention also cannot be opted for. Payment proofs cannot be uploaded from gallery.,1
"Why this app is misbehaving always. It is automatically taking my location even if it is off because of that I can't search any other restaurants in Mumbai. And when I am searching for any restaurants in Google it is directing me to the app for the menu, but menu doesn't open in app it take your location and shows resturants in your place because of which I can't see menu of restaurants which I want. Totally disappointed. I can't see menu of any restaurants in Google or app even though I have it",1
"Worst experience. I've been a daily user for months. As per their policy if food is later than 30 mins it can be cancelled, only for them to later tell me that's not possible. Get your stuff sorted",1
"Even though I set the location and address, it somehow doesn't save it to the correct location automatically sets it to another location. Please rectify this error.",3
Poor service. No customer service executives available to call. They take no responsibility if the delivery is late and don't refund the money back. Also the app crashes many times.,1
"this app was the best when i started using it,but now it has become the worst ,as it always shows that cash on delivery method of payment is not available....worst!!!!",1
"No response on customer service. And if payment is done on the spot, why can't refund be done on the spot. We need money for food at the time not afterwards. Please resolve as this is affecting us mentally and physically.",1
Worst ever experience with Zomato. I order food from McDonald and i see that cold drink spilled all over and entire food become wet and was not in condition of eatable. I checked with customer care what they told is you have to eat the same food we can not do anything in this case. Going to uninstall this app. Swiggy and other delivery partner are far better in this. #Boycott Zomato,1
Zomato is fraud company i had order food my order was not delevired to me i had paid for the I had told them they told plzzz take it one time execption worst app zomato is swiggy is best,1
"The delivery guy marked the order as delivered after I've been waiting for 45 mins and I'm left hungry. I contact the customer service n after spending another hour with them, they bluntly say we will refund ur amount in zomato credits in 24 hrs. The customer service person has no idea about handling the situation either. They keep on saying random stuff instead of closing the issue. If they take 1 second to deduct money from you account, why do they need 24 hrs to refund. Never pay online. Pathetic service by zomato. Don't use this app.",1
"useless app. nothing to do with the website usefulness. can't search anything around me, keeps annoying me with gps location and forces install this app if you try use the mobile browser view. and therefore if you link the browser to the app, the app forgets what you were seeing. resuming: fail app",1
Service is very poor. Even i am a zomato gold member. But the service is 👎. Zomato valet pick multiple orders and the food reached late multiple times this has been happend with me. Order within the same route is understandable but for opposite directions 😭😭,1
this app has the worst customer support and delivery support ever.. when i ordered something from this app the delivery guy called me and said he cant deliver it and then told me that the order would be cancelled and i would get the refund.. so i placed a new order.. however later i got both the deliveries and was charged as well. when i tried contacting the customer service they told me i would be charged.. so i waa left with less money and extra food that would get spoiled.. thank you zomato,1
I'm a gold membership customer. Zomato agents are not helpful. While I raised the complaint and no action has been taken towards the restaurants. This has happened few times. Many restaurants they sell on half discounted rates and still the rates are high with bad quality as well as quantity (Is the discount useful for us as customer). We pay our hard earned money just to enjoy the meal and in return we get disappointment.,1
Very poor app. The food is generally very bad quality. They have no quality control over the restaurants and obviously no customer care.. inspite of complaints no resolution comes through and they don't bother about it .,1
Zomato delivery is always a bad experience to me they make money by stealing our hard earned money,1
The best app for food delivery and information. constantly comes up with best discounts and offers too. absolutely love it. very courteous valets and the service is on time. keep it up.,5
Such a bad service from customer care chat team. They cheat customer by chating like they support us.After taking the rating they left without problem solved.pathetic customer care chat team.,1
When I feel hungry at 11'o clock also I can order anything . This is very good app. We will get more nice offers and discounts on our orders than getting it on our own. The only thing that is to improve the timmings of the delivery,5
"1. very bad customer service. 2. They don't give you contact number of delivery boy in case you need to update the delivery location 3. you can't cancel any order once it is placed , even before the restaurant accept that order",1
Very bad experience with the app..The app should not have cod payment method. The valets who carry the order do not carry change even after telling them which creates problems in payment..also they're limited in online payment accept like they do not use or have paytm or google pay only have phonepe,1
"Don't use this instead use swiggy or Dunzo, they do not have cancelation policy, even if you order something by mistake they can't cancel it, I did not receive any assistance, at last my 1500 order which was by mistake they did not cancel in fraction of seconds made a request, they are fraud don't use zomato ever pathetic service.",1
"Delivery charges changed by 4 rupees for an increase of 100 meters, Wow. Further for a delivery within 3-4 km it is charged as Rs 32. Don't think even what food is served to customers is checked from partners on regular basis. Needs lot of improvement.",2
"Easy to use. Two things i wish could have been better. 1. Getting crash whenever notification arrives( OS Marshmallow). 2. If I search for restaurant, I couldnt see the dish to order. May be that restaurant might not listed for delivery. I am not sure.",4
worst ever experience. prediction of delivery is about 25 minutes and it takes almost 2 hours to deliver. also theres no option of cancelling the order. support link takes too long to respond. (it was not opening in my case),1
"Payment made by me is successful, but after payment it hasnt redirected to zomoto. So order failed abruptly. But refund was not provided. When i contact the bank, they said transaction was successful to merchant, for any information contact the merchant. But zomoto isnt responding. Bank statment says that transfer to atom technologies. But if transaction hasnt reached zomato, why the transaction is not rolled back. Complaint Status",1
Food was not delivered twice or thrice from two restaurants which were delivering food theirselves. I'll not mention the name as I hope they will rectify that issue. And zomato finally replied and resolved the issue I faced. I'll always rate 5 out of 5 star to zomato delivery valet. I appreciate zomato for the resolution I've seen today. By overall experience I had I'll rate zomato 4 out of 5 star. Thanks for your support and service.,4
The best delivery system,5
"I placed an order today and I didn't received the food till now. Location of rider is steady, when I made call, the no. was switched off. Chat is hang on status of typing, support no. is switched off.",1
I am a regular usee of this app and recently i have started facing a lotbof issues wiyh hhe behaviour of the delivery boys..We live in an apartment and on the 3rd floor ..it is not possible to go down n pick up delivery going to the ground floor ..some rude n arrogant delivery boys refuse to come up n deliver ...they should know the difference between delivery at a house and an apartment or complex. ..,1
very bad experience.I had to cancel my order for some urgent reason.cancellation was done within 2to 3 minutes.There policy doesn't allow them to remove cancellation charges.I had talked to the restaurant and no food was prepared.Now I am placing order for 26 rs sweets they are adding rs325 cancellation charges .when chatted with them they said it is their policy they can't do anything.alas three cheers for zomato.money making policy.,1
"Your new interface sucks, I am not even sure what I am ordering, everythjng is mixed up. I have to use the app like I am operating on some kind of complex puzzle. Keep it simple",1
"Loved It! Please add Cancel order Button! Because Sometimes , we order something by mistake! And sometimes when The shop owner rejects our order , We don't receive our refund! I got a loss of 900 rupess In My Parents Marriage Anniversary!",4
Wowwww delivery.no calls et all.Good attitude boys ❤️👍,5
poor delivery. it seems they have taken people for granted. very slow delivery generally they take more than 1 hour for delievry and once you are ordering the food it shows food will be delivered in 20-25 mins. even the executive on the chat do not revert,1
Very good app good job zomato but one problem your food are not hot it gets cold,4
"There is option to contact customer care but they won't respond. I have recently lost my money. The money was deducted from bank, but the order was not placed. So guys please don't use this app. You will get better customer support from swiggy, uber eats etc.",1
its easy to order food. all good restaurants are avl in the list. but sometimes got different items which i never ordered. but its ok sometime. delivery is on time. service behaviour is good & zomato contact centre people are also very supportive.,5
Worst app... Cash on delivery is not available every time.. and when it's available it is not allowed to apply promo code. Maximum time resturant are refuse to accept order only Street food types of stall are available..interesting thing is u will not able to complain on customer thing.. Fruad,1
"The service is good, but please make sure, you deliver on time ! sometimes I get my order after 45 mins from a hotel nearby, and the estimated time would be 25 mins.",5
just offers no quality control its just a delivery app which doesnt look after any aspect other than delivery. one can just give a review in the app and that changes nothing neither quality nor timely delivery . its only good if one cant go to a restuarant.,1
"In case of any mishap, they don't provide any help. Often won't even provide a customer service executive to assist you, all you get is an automated bot. Everything is alright apart from the pathetic customer service.",1
Very poor service restaurant accept order then cancels it by saying we can not deliver in your area and which take enough time to reflect in app so that u can die due to hinger😠 And they don't have customer care all they have is chat box. Where u can not type u have to select ur problm. Really disappointed.,1
"Terrible service. Everytime there is one or the other problem. Payment issues, rider issues. The order is always late or they will deliver the wrong order.",1
Services of Zomato is not good . And the fake message come before the food deliver,3
"Zomato is Amazon in food delivery. Many of you would be wondering why this guy is comparing apple with an orange. Well, when it comes to customer service, there is no other delivery app who provides even a comparable service what Zomato provides. They are the best in customer service and their agents are eager to listen and help. And this excellent customer service coupled with a good number of restaurants serving delicious food makes the Zomato the obvious choice for me, everytime:)",5
"Pathetic app..very difficult to find menu and delivery options in restaurant menus..also the restaurants that currently not accepting online orders also reflects as available options in menu. Just waste of time, go and learn to design an app from Swiggy.",1
worst app.. they assigned my order to restaurant as rider was not available.. the restaurant called me and asked whether I can order other food as the food I ordered was not available. when I refused to do so and asked for refund they assured me that I will get refund and update the order status to delivered.. the zomato didn't take complaint as restaurant was delivering order and restaurant is nit receiving calls..,1
"Whenever I try to open Zomato customer care chat, it closes down automatically and goes back to the previous screen. I am just not able to use the chat feature and it is very frustrating.",1
It happens with me many time that i order in evening around 8 and i wait for 1 hour then rider goes missing and his phone is also switched off.. Then wait for 2 hours then chat with customer care then they just apologize and cancel the order.. They never think that at 10pm what will i eat.. Feel so helpless at that time.. Just pathetic service..,1
it is worth experience it is good for 1st users but sometimes the restaurant eccept the order give time to deliver bug waiting for 4 our it will not deliver and the person who is hungry has to wait gor hours for food and end upto cancelling the order and it is not showing live tracking also and it is not updated the customer,1
"Pathetic customer service..i cannot really explain how dissatisfied and annoyed im with the language used and with the time used to reply on my concerns..i had to plead nd write reply and say 10 times each everytime..they call them support executive and they dont even reply and support.. you ask them 'a' they will write their standard copy paste answers but for 'b' which was never your concern.. im paranoid with the behavior or the executive who spoke with me..he was shameless,hopeless n useless",1
Very good service. This app is the most practical and convenient. Delivery is super fast. Customer service is exceptional. And the discounts are great. A feature that could be added is where the restaurant can upload in real time if items are out of stock or unavailable to reduce cancelled orders. EDIT : My overall rating has come down as Zomato has changed the Gold Buy 1 Get 1 offer to overall discount which is a meagre 20% for most places. This is unfair to users who have opted for the plan.,2
They least worried about customer issues. No proper customer support. They don't worried about customer and never question the restaurant if any issue with parcel or any quality issue. I personally faced it . I never recommend this app. If you need peaceful life Don't install this app,1
"Poor App. Pathetic customer service. Erratic App, clearly unable to handle surge hours. Lost my money and no order was placed and in addition the customer service section of the app became invisible. This is nothing short of a scam!!",1
Poorly dsigned app. Not customer friendly..wilfully hides cancellation modificatjon optjons. no pooup reminging to apply promocode before order. cant sense the promo by the payment optiom chosen. chat option is hidden. customer care number should be conspicuously diplayed. But fo my inertia i would habe shifted to a better app long back,1
To all customers who are using zomato please avoid to pay online and try to use cash on delivery otherwise there is chances that you loose your money if order not deliver. I have ordered something and paid online from the select address option . Rider and customer care cancel my order and saying that the map you have selected is wrong .However the address is perfect and i have received orders on same address previously. They took my money and no response from email or chat.Always use COD option.,1
Zomato made ordering food very easy. Lots of offers make it cheaper than others. Also there is a very helpful customer service. whenever there is any problem with order they always help without any delay. Amazing experience with zomato 😋,5
The latest update has a lot of glitches. Doesn't show any restaurants. The screen just says we are not accepting orders online. We'll be back soon. Only when you search for specific restaurants does it show anything.,1
Had a disgusting experience.order was given hotel which is 10km away from my home.can u imagine how one can eat cold food..??? When i cancelled this i dint get refund also. Shameful thing is that there is no customer care no to speak on our problem. Automated message reply coming in chat service. Is this the way u run a Company???,1
I just ordered a tex mex salad and i got poisoned. I am still vomiting from the sauce of a SALAD.They don't serve food. This is NOT food. What is the ministry of public health still waiting for? What a shame.. Tfeh,5
Very poor customer service . After doing mail to customer care nothing was happened. First of all they are placing order mistakely if you are doing mail to customer care no response to your email is coming from them. I am totally frustrated with this app.,1
Very good and tasty 😊😍,5
not that much better like swiggy. regarding swiggy they never ask about oocation and the path. they come thru map. here we are supposed to guide them. please improve on that. today my order was not delivered trying to discuss with both the restaurant person and the delivery person. no response from both. very worst app and service...,1
use only when u have ample of time for doing chat with Zomato.. bcz there will always be some issues.. let it be of restaurants or the app itself.. and u can't call zomato.. just chat and wait for response and keep on typing the problem u having... seriously ?????,2
The app is pathetic. Once I cancelled my order since then they have disabled my cash on delivery option.,1
"I was a happy Zomato user so far. But I am extremely shocked to see such fallen standards of customer support, especially in times when brands are giving customer support top priority. They have very poor customer support and have extremely poor policies for customer grievances. It's not how many times you serve your customer well but what matters is how you handle things when customer is not satisfied. I realized for Zomato, money is top most priority than customer. Very badly disappointed.",1
Worst experience. Most of the food will be delivered 1 hour after estimated time. The delivery boys wont deliver to door. They ask to go to their location. Zomato is worst at solving issues. Never ever going to order food in Zamato. Careem now is best Uber is also fine.,1
"really bad customer service where they send messages of regret and apology without solving the issue and act as if the issue is unsolvable.Disapponted a long time customer where i used to order almost everyday and when i had a problem..all i get is ""zomato credits"" and apology messages instead of a refund",1
"As a Zomato Gold Membership holder, i can say its the best deal for people who love going out to enjoy delicious food and drinks. The live tracking delivery along with offers, piggybank concept and choices of restraunt makes it a special/must app for Food Lovers",5
"Their delivery method is really bad. Most of the time Zomato miss the timeline which they show on the app. Not just by 5 - 10 mins. If you want to orders to be delivered on time, double the time which they show on app.",2
"Worst food ordering app. Every experience has been a nightmare with Zomato. A few days ago, I ordered food using zomato at 10 PM and paid online but never received the order and then I tried to call the restaurant oven pizza story but my call was unattained. Then I have reached zomato chat support who kept me waiting for 1 hour & 20 mins. Nobody responds on chat support. Later my order was canceled. Swiggy is much better, they value their customers.Uninstalling due to pathetic experience. Adios",1
Online food order and delivery app. Sometimes there is good offer. Discount % can be misleading as always there is a cap on max amount. Many restaurants have higher rate on Zomato. It will be cheaper to take away.,3
Worst App to order food. Provided incomplete food first and then on complaining just provided a little amount of refund. How could somebody eat the food when the main item is missing..It was complete waste of food. Really very bad experience.,1
"Worst customer service, you don't get any option to get help from them before the order is placed. My payment has already been deducted from my paytm wallet and the order is not placed. There is nothing in order list regarding my this paid cancelled order. There's no customer care number and no help section in the app",1
There is no doubt on delivery it's good. But prices r way too high from the restaurant charges as well as taxes and delivery charges. I have checked in many restaurants. Hope Zomato does some changes in their tax charges.,2
"Worst app. swiggy is better in every aspect. They don't cancel the order if we want to. I ordered at one place and they did not accept it for 45 mins and when I wanted to cancel zomato did not allow me to cancel. Also they do not give refunds immediately, very poor service. waiting time for food is long, waiting time to get a reply from customer service is long. all in all a pathetic app.",1
"Zomato is just amazing. Loved my first experience with it and still loving it!. I'm gonna miss Uber Eats as I had to move to Zomato. Starting from the basic interface, ordering food to delivery is really smooth. Also my first meal delivery was pretty fast. Also you can Tip the rider as well, depending on how the delivery was for you. Altogether it's a beautiful App. Should definitely try it.",5
"Ordered 80 minutes ago initially it was showing 38 minutes delivery time after this much time didn't received the order, contacted restaurant they say the valet left 40 minutes ago, when trying to contact valet his no is showing switched off, after that contacted zomato support they are also jot replying vey unprofessional service and support.",1
"very bad experience, ordered waited for 2 hours. the order changed by default to delivered but their delivery agent never reached. after 1 hour of my following they just refunded the money. but no food. going to order from swiggy from now on.",1
"User-friendly app to order food and book for dining. Brings in best offers to its customers through zomato gold and many other offers. You can check out the menu of restaurants, most preferred food in each places etc. Allows multiple payment options. Recommend to use the app if you love to try and experience different cusines.",5
App is great. No problems otherwise but it's stopped showing the location of the restaurant (area name) in the tab which makes it difficult to filter out choices... This wasn't so earlier. Pls fix.,4
great one...... changing the interface would be more helpful .....when i compare with other apps ...i found zomato interface less interactive ....try working on different low saturated colors to the interface other than white....(my opinion),5
"Always excuses, don't ever order from ZOMATO.... even item is not good or missing still they are telling that please take it as exception and they will not help you for anything. I have sent mail also to their team but they won't respond also. Right now I am uninstalling this application.",1
"Zomato has no idea or sense of how much to charge for delivery, i mean they are just randomly applying any highest value to their delivery that they can apply as i simply ordered samosa chat n poha which costed 52 n to deliver that they are charging extra 52!!! In their delivery charge i can have the same combo again, its that much huge!! Are you gonna deliver it via your jet plane in literally less than 2 min. or have i ordered something like gold for which you are charging such amount",1
"While ordering the estimated delivery time was shown as 20 mins. After payment, the time changed to 45 min. When I cancelled the order, I was charged 200 Rs. I spoke to customer support, they were very rude and did not refund the amount. Uninstalling...",1
"Very bad service by Zomato, I guess that is why people started using and enjoying service from Swiggy. If there is any issue with your order no matter what but we don't have any option to contact and the chat service is way to awful.",1
"No control over pricing by restaurants. Most of the restaurant's offline prices are half of what is available on zomato. Add delivery fee, variable surcharge fee, packaging fee, tax... Case of cheating its customers.",1
Zomato is easy to use app with live tracking.,5
"Very poor support, no customer experience. Despite the address being right, the delivery executive went to some different location which was 2.6 km away from my location. The customer executive cancelled our order and didn't not give any refund!! Moreover the customer executive asked me to go to the delivery guy's location to retrieve the order! Well, zomato we pay to you for delivering at door step not otherwise..!",1
Useless app. Never order on it. They canceled the order when it was near to delivery. And they didn't refund the amount giving nonsense reasons. Never order from it. Very poor customer service.,1
Great app. The collection and delivery is very good. Never disappointed. I have been a loyal customer since they confronted regressive politics and reminded all of us that food is a religion in itself,5
Usually the food orders are incorrect or not upto the mark and the support from the online help is not quite as good either. The overall app is good and convenient to use but the services are not so customer centric.,2
Simplicity is gone too much unwanted things added like zomaland and videos things are complicated now in the apps user is not able to find where is his previous order and other sections now you are update is rolling out what new things you added news reports!!!,1
Way better to have a meal going outside the home and wait much to make our stomach full... Thankful to the developer of this app.. And the mindset to do something new.. Loved it.. And also loved the delivery process.. The least time it takes to reach within us and also the delivery boy was so gentle af❤️,5
Worst app ever used... It is just fooling the customers in the name of providing fake service. Not only the price but also the intention of the company and future perspective is low. Can't survive in the market for much long. No customer satisfaction. No management,1
this was my first order on zomato and they called and told me it wont be delivered because merchant had shifted to some other place and they are unable to get the new location. which is really pathetic. I strongly suggest dont use zomato. this aap is just giving fake promises. its a very very bad app,1
"Actually Zomato deserves no star...today i ordered in zomato after payment via Google pay, the app showed that payment failed and try another method, so I again paid for the same order via SBI Internet Banking..After some time Zomato valvet called me that i ordered the same items twice..i told him what actually happened..then i got another call from zomato that the other order cannot be cancelled..So Zomato is scandolous..they will take double payment..so think twice before you order via Zomato",1
"great app,but need to cut down the deliv.charges, and add some more pocket friendly restraunts and dishes! tge delivery people are really friendly and picks up call.... as if now good expirience hope for the same services in future with improved furtherance",4
Nice app for foodies,5
"While the options for eateries is excellent catering to all tastes and budgets, sodexo cards are not accepted. Payment by UPI does not happen. So far I have not been able to add my credit card. It's as if zomato wants to avoid reviewing payment via credit card.",3
"I like ther services in kochi. It is the best way to choose food during the hotel stay i dont know the experiance of local but this is good service by the way..... I like it. And also that you can have choice of your liked foods from any resturants to any hotel in ther area where you have stayes. So, just see the app, select your choice and pay with many options.",5
"great app to learn and know about different eateries and restaurants. the good thing about this is, you can share your experiences and let people know what to expect when they visit certain places which is really interesting",4
"While placing and confirming the order on the app, billing amount was shown after the discount of applied promo code but while delivering the food and collecting the payment, full bill amount (excluding/ without promo code discount) has been collected",3
"This is a very bad app and if their is any problem they will not co-operate with you and if the order gets cancelled they will say they will refund but they do not refund very easily untill you get on them.They also have a very bad conversation method which is chatting rather than calling in the app, if you have any problem with anything on the app.They treat you very badly as a customer and do not co-operate with you.Please use swiggy and they will now delete my comment as it is against them.",1
best food delivery app,5
"Great services but I've had some issues lately and the customer care doesn't help at times. If cancel button was added for atleast 5-10 after ordering, it would help. The cancel button helps a lot!",4
"Not really that great experience, had a few goof ups from the vendor and delivery guys for which I had to be penalized, not happy as we do not have a customer service option, chat mostly does not work, not sure where we can escalate it.",2
Innitially it was good. But since than it changes customer services to auto bot it getting wirsen. I got wrong and burned food and also in less number which i have ordered. I emailed him also.. Nothing happen to me.. Worst experience..!,1
It's gives to bad service for refund policy . Don't believe them the delivery boys he did the wrong way to cancelled the order I have raised a request many times but didn't get any type of response . The support number is also not available just doing the fraud with us.,1
Lot of bugs i cant understand some times it take so much time start and some it showing 50 percent discout logo on resturent but restaurent is not accepting coupen some time it dont accept the order some time showing all restaurent currently accepting the order behaviour of delivery boy is to harsh these things are not stopping they are happeing continously help support is good i give stars for them but for the app i will give zero,1
"100% cancellation penalties which is insane, even no call support, only chat and email support unless delivery vallet is assigned. If you urge a request that the cancellation is mistakenly done they will not revert back the process. #worseexperience",1
Horrible experience and indifferent attitude of the support team. They had no logical answer as to why they were not ready to deliver an order which we had placed on 17th June . They were more inclined to prompt us to cancel the order for thier incompetence . No refund made yet even after 20 days.,1
This app sucks form last two times it has received the order and just after 40 min when I'm expecting the order at my door it is cancelling my order and returning my money. Returning my money is not an option. Where the hell will i get food now. Useless application.,1
"Changing rating after using app for a year. Thank You. its one of worst add I came across, to prove that they don't care about customers check the review, they never replied anyone. Also they give false information on their website. For new use they say a discount of 150 for 5 order. When i checked with their customer care they told its wrong information to fool people. So people install their app and pay high money and this people earn profit.",5
Very nice food,5
"Delivery service is not good. Make cancellation charges for their own order mishaps. Didn't get my food 2 times, never pay before you get ur food . Moreover their customer chat support is just a joke, always gives computerized replies",1
"very poor service. more than an hour delay from the time mentioned. not once, but time and again. it's high time zomato keeps up with customers' expectations. especially orders from papa John's.",1
"this is the 2nd time within few days i lost money and no order delivered.. now since this update ..things are going worst.. payment deducted after that app will freeze and dosnt return to order page.. we rely on this when only hungry...remembr that... now i have no food...yet money deducted frm accnt also.. when i click on custmr supprt option..it says ' smthing went wrong,plz try again..' fed up...i hope u guys will help soo",1
Zomato app needs so much of improvement and payment gateways are also too slow whole app needs to improve and bug fixes. It shows status of payment after the order is accepted initially payments fails and automatically order is accepted and Amount gets debited everytime I had very poor experience.,3
I ordered food from app and got food very delayed after complaning they gave me compensation with coupon worth of 1000bugs but when I try to apply the coupon it is not working.. when I complained about this in customer care they are responding that it will not work....worst service n easily cheats the customers...shame on you @zomato for cheating people,1
"Zomato didt have Dominos ph no, Or delivery boy number didn't deliver on time from dominos Didn't get proper answer in zomato chat",1
Absolutely horrible experience. They'll wait until an hour after you order to cancel your order. I'd suggest to not use Zomato as their system is unreliable with multiple technical issues and their customer support is terrible as well. Swiggy is much better to use.,1
"My experience with Zomato has been good so far except the experience i had yesterday. I ordered food from a restaurant called Chappan bhog. The food came was completely rotten. I had a few spoons and then I realized it is spoiled. I tried calling restaurant, they did not pickup the call. I texted zomato for refund,they said they have escalated this issue and will work on it. after coming back my home I fell sick and I m still waiting for the refund.",3
"Very poor service, customer service chat is a bot not a human. Drunk delivery boys. They pick up order and then go to pick up another order. When complained on chat, they (bot) simply replied ""this is a one off incident. We will serve you better in future. Hope we have resolved your query""",1
Worst service. The ordered should not be accepted when cannot be delivered. The order will be confirmed and we get call that thier is no zomato delivery person available. If such case the payment should also be taken only after everything is in its place. Very disshearted. Worst worst worst,1
"usually the experience of late has been Poor to say politely! Zomato does not own its issues and looks to put issues on head of vendor or customer (which ever works in their case). sad as soon they will be left behind in business with better services being offered by competition. one of the primaryvreason, i did not renew my gold membership with Zomato!",2
"zamato app is much superier than swiggy or anything else app. i think always customer need to know the food quantity and picture what they order. for example i order kadai pneer half plate , from different restaurant by different days. every restaurant has different quantity of half plate . so quantity mentioned is necessary. thank..",4
